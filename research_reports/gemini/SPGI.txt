S&P Global (SPGI): Premium Valuation Justified by Wide Moat and Strategic Execution

August 1, 2025

Investment Summary & Recommendation

We are initiating coverage on S&P Global with a HOLD rating and a 12-month price target of $575.00. S&P Global represents a best-in-class financial information services provider, boasting a "Wide" economic moat, an "Exemplary" capital allocation track record, and a resilient portfolio of high-margin businesses with highly recurring revenue streams.1 The company's recently reported second-quarter 2025 results and corresponding upward revision to its full-year guidance underscore a consistent pattern of excellent operational execution and fundamental business strength.4
However, the market has already recognized this quality. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of approximately 29.8 times our 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) estimate, the stock commands a significant premium to the broader S&P 500 index and is valued near the upper end of its own historical range.5 While confidence in the company's long-term growth algorithm—driven by secular tailwinds, pricing power, and strategic initiatives—is well-founded, the current valuation appears to fully incorporate this strong fundamental outlook. This leaves a balanced risk/reward profile over the next 12 months, with our price target suggesting a modest 8.5% total return potential.
Key catalysts that could drive future upside include the successful value-unlock from the planned separation of the Mobility segment and evidence of greater-than-expected margin expansion from the company's investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI).5 While the long-term investment thesis remains compelling, we await a more attractive entry point to recommend accumulating shares and therefore initiate with a HOLD rating.

The market appears to be in a "show-me" phase with S&P Global. Despite stellar operational performance and a clear long-term growth strategy, the stock has been largely range-bound in recent months, struggling to sustainably break out above its 52-week high of $579.05 set in August 2025.8 This price action suggests the presence of a valuation ceiling, likely imposed by broader macroeconomic concerns such as the persistence of higher interest rates and the already-premium multiple at which the stock trades. The company's strong Q2 2025 earnings beat and raised guidance provided a positive catalyst, yet the stock's inability to forge new highs indicates that simply meeting high expectations is insufficient to drive significant further appreciation.4 In the current market environment, investors appear unwilling to pay an even higher multiple for the company's high-quality earnings stream. This creates a dynamic where the company must consistently exceed already-lofty expectations or deliver a new, transformative catalyst to justify further multiple expansion. The upcoming separation of the Mobility business and the delivery of tangible, margin-accretive results from ongoing AI investments represent the most probable catalysts that could break this impasse.5 Our HOLD rating reflects this prevailing tension between excellent underlying fundamentals and a demanding valuation.

Q2 2025 Earnings: Strong Execution and Raised Outlook

S&P Global reported robust second-quarter 2025 results on July 31, 2025, comfortably exceeding consensus analyst estimates on both revenue and profitability. The performance was driven by broad-based strength across its portfolio, with particularly strong contributions from the Market Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices segments, demonstrating the resilience of its diversified business model.4
For the quarter, revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $3.755 billion, surpassing consensus estimates by approximately $80 million.4 A key indicator of the business's stability and visibility, subscription-based revenue, grew by a healthy 7% year-over-year, reinforcing the durable nature of the company's customer relationships.4
Profitability was a standout feature of the quarter. The company achieved an adjusted operating profit margin of 51.4%, representing an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior-year period.4 This margin improvement, achieved while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives, highlights strong cost discipline and the significant operating leverage inherent in the company's scalable platforms. Consequently, adjusted diluted EPS rose 10% year-over-year to $4.43, beating the consensus forecast of $4.23 by $0.20.7 EPS growth was further amplified by a 2% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, a direct result of the company's active capital return program.4
Reflecting the strong first-half performance and confidence in the outlook, management updated its guidance for the full fiscal year 2025. The company maintained its revenue growth forecast in the range of 5% to 7%. More significantly, it raised the lower end of its adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.25, resulting in a new, narrower range of $17.00 to $17.25.4 This upward revision served as a key positive signal to the market regarding management's conviction in the earnings power of the business for the remainder of the year.
In conjunction with the earnings release, the company reiterated its commitment to robust capital returns, affirming its target to return approximately 85% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in 2025. Management also announced its intention to execute up to $1.3 billion in additional accelerated share repurchases (ASR) in the coming weeks, further underscoring its focus on enhancing shareholder value.4

The 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion during a period of continued and deliberate investment in AI and other technologies is a particularly noteworthy achievement. Companies undertaking significant technological upgrades and product development, such as the rollout of Capital IQ Pro ChatIQ and new AI-enhanced indices, typically face near-term pressure on margins.5 The fact that S&P Global expanded margins despite these investments indicates that the core business's profitability is growing at an even faster rate. This performance is attributable to a powerful combination of factors: significant pricing power derived from its wide economic moat, the immense scalability of its data platforms which carry low marginal costs for serving new clients, and the successful realization of cost synergies from the 2022 merger with IHS Markit.14 This demonstrates a formidable financial model where incremental revenue growth translates into disproportionately higher profit growth. This gives us high confidence in management's ability to achieve its long-term target of low- to mid-teens EPS growth and suggests that future margin expansion, driven by accelerating AI-enabled efficiencies, may have the potential to surprise to the upside.

Wide Moat Defends a Diversified Financial Data Fortress

S&P Global is a premier provider of "essential intelligence," a term the company uses to describe its indispensable role in the global financial ecosystem. It operates through five principal business segments, delivering a comprehensive suite of credit ratings, benchmarks, data, analytics, and workflow solutions to participants in the capital and commodity markets across the globe.2 The company's business model is exceptionally resilient, characterized by a high proportion of recurring, subscription-based revenue, which accounted for approximately 52% of total revenue in 2024 and provides a stable and predictable financial foundation.17

Segment Deep Dive

A granular analysis of S&P Global's segments reveals a portfolio of highly defensible, high-margin businesses, each a leader in its respective niche.
Market Intelligence (Approx. 39% of Revenue): As the company's largest segment by revenue, Market Intelligence is the primary delivery mechanism for S&P Global's vast datasets. Its flagship products, including the Capital IQ Pro desktop platform and Xpressfeed data feeds, are deeply integrated into the daily workflows of investment professionals, analysts, and corporate executives. While the segment faces formidable competition from players like Bloomberg, Refinitiv (LSEG), and FactSet, it maintains a strong competitive position through the breadth of its data and the quality of its analytical tools.2
Ratings (Approx. 30% of Revenue): This is the company's most profitable segment and the historical bedrock of its brand. S&P Global Ratings is the world's largest credit rating agency, commanding an estimated 50% of the global market.18 The industry structure is a classic oligopoly, shared with Moody's (approximately 32% market share) and Fitch Ratings (approximately 13%).19 This structure creates an exceptionally wide and durable economic moat, fortified by regulatory mandates that require ratings for certain investments and the immense reputational and historical barriers that prevent new entrants. The segment's revenue is composed of both transaction-based fees, tied to the volume of new debt issuance, and more stable non-transaction revenue from surveillance and new entity ratings, making it the most cyclically sensitive part of the portfolio.2
Commodity Insights (Approx. 13% of Revenue): Operating primarily under the Platts brand, this segment provides essential price assessments, benchmarks, and analytics for the global commodity markets, including energy, petrochemicals, metals, and agriculture. Platts benchmarks, such as its Dated Brent crude oil assessment, are deeply embedded as the reference price in physical and derivative contracts worldwide, creating extremely high switching costs for market participants.2
Indices (Approx. 11% of Revenue): This segment, a joint venture with CME Group, is the home of the world's most recognized equity benchmark, the S&P 500. It generates revenue from three primary sources: asset-linked fees from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that track its indices, subscription fees for benchmark data, and transaction-based royalties from exchange-traded derivatives. The ongoing secular shift from active to passive investment management provides a powerful and durable tailwind for this business.2
Mobility (Approx. 7% of Revenue): This segment provides a wide array of data, analytics, and solutions serving the entire automotive value chain, from manufacturers to dealers to consumers. Its most recognized brand is Carfax, which provides vehicle history reports. As announced by the company, this segment is currently in the process of being separated into a standalone public company.4

Economic Moat Analysis: Wide and Deepening

Morningstar assigns S&P Global a "Wide" economic moat rating, a conclusion with which this analysis strongly concurs.2 The company's competitive advantages are powerful, multifaceted, and mutually reinforcing, stemming from several of the classic moat sources.
Intangible Assets: The S&P brand is a powerful intangible asset, globally synonymous with financial integrity, independence, and quality. This brand recognition is a regulatory prerequisite in many areas of the capital markets, particularly for credit ratings. Furthermore, its flagship benchmarks—such as the S&P 500 index and Platts' oil price assessments—are universally accepted standards, functioning as the financial market's equivalent of a universal language.1
High Switching Costs: S&P Global's products and data are deeply embedded in its clients' most critical internal processes. Financial institutions build complex risk models, trading algorithms, and compliance frameworks around S&P's data feeds and proprietary identifiers (like CUSIPs). Asset managers structure entire product lines around its indices. Migrating these deeply integrated systems to a competitor's platform would be an undertaking of immense cost, time, and operational risk, making clients exceptionally sticky.24
Network Effects: The Ratings business exhibits a powerful network effect. The value of an S&P credit rating to an issuer of debt increases as more investors recognize and rely on that rating for their investment decisions. Conversely, the value to an investor increases as more issuers obtain the rating, creating a broader universe of comparable securities. This self-reinforcing dynamic creates a virtuous cycle that effectively locks out potential new competitors and solidifies the oligopolistic market structure.24
These distinct segments do not operate in isolation; they form a powerful, synergistic ecosystem. The data and analytical output from one segment often become the raw material for high-value products sold by another. For instance, the credit ratings and underlying analysis generated by the Ratings division are packaged and distributed through the Market Intelligence platforms via products like RatingsXpress® and RatingsDirect®.17 Similarly, the indices created by S&P Dow Jones Indices are licensed for the creation of ETFs, which are then tracked and analyzed by asset managers using the tools and data available on the Capital IQ Pro platform. This is not merely a conglomerate of disconnected businesses but a deeply integrated data and analytics flywheel. The "data exhaust" from one business process becomes a valuable, monetizable product in another. This cross-segment data flow represents a profound structural advantage, increasing customer stickiness and providing a unique, proprietary foundation for developing next-generation products, particularly those powered by AI. This structural advantage is a primary justification for the company's premium valuation.

Strategic Repositioning for Future Growth

S&P Global's management team is actively and astutely shaping the company's portfolio, divesting non-core or slower-growth assets while reinvesting in areas with strong secular tailwinds and clear synergies with the core franchise.

Portfolio Optimization

The company's recent and planned corporate actions illustrate a clear strategy to sharpen its focus on high-growth, high-margin financial information services.
Mobility Segment Separation: The planned spin-off of the Mobility division is proceeding as scheduled.4 This strategic move is designed to unlock the value of a high-quality automotive data asset that may be underappreciated by investors within the larger, more financially-focused S&P Global conglomerate. As a standalone entity, it can pursue a more tailored growth strategy and attract a dedicated investor base.
Strategic Acquisitions: The recently announced $1.8 billion acquisition of "With Intelligence," a provider of data and analytics for the private markets, is a clear signal of the company's strategic priorities.5 This tuck-in acquisition, which will be integrated into the Market Intelligence segment, directly addresses the surging demand for data in opaque but rapidly growing asset classes like private credit and private equity.
Non-Core Divestitures: The completed sale of the OSTTRA joint venture to KKR for $3.1 billion represents another step in streamlining the portfolio.25 This divestiture simplifies the business structure and provides additional capital that can be redeployed into higher-growth initiatives or returned to shareholders.
The combination of the Mobility spin-off and the "With Intelligence" acquisition represents a deliberate and intelligent strategic pivot. S&P Global is shedding a strong but non-core asset to double down on its central competency: providing essential, data-driven intelligence to institutional financial market participants. Management is trading a business with a distinct customer base (auto dealers, consumers) for one that directly serves its core institutional clients. The private markets space is a key area of growth and focus for these clients, and one where high-quality, reliable data is both scarce and highly valued. This is more than just portfolio housekeeping; it is a strategic refocusing that will transform S&P Global into a purer-play on institutional financial data. This sharpened focus should enhance revenue synergies across the remaining segments—for example, by cross-selling new private market data solutions to the vast existing user base of Capital IQ—and could command a higher valuation multiple over the long term as the business becomes more focused and easier for investors to analyze.

Capital Allocation and Technology Investment

S&P Global's approach to capital allocation is a key strength, earning an "Exemplary" rating from Morningstar for its strategically sound investments and consistent, attractive shareholder distributions.2
Shareholder Returns: The company boasts a 52-year track record of consecutive annual dividend increases, a hallmark of a durable and growing business.7 Management targets returning approximately 85% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.4 The dividend was increased by 5.5% in early 2025, and the company is actively executing a significant share repurchase program, including a newly announced $1.3 billion ASR.4
Technology and AI: S&P Global is at the forefront of integrating AI into its products and internal operations to drive both revenue growth and operational efficiency. Recent product innovations, such as the AI-powered ChatIQ tool within Capital IQ Pro and the launch of AI-enhanced indices, demonstrate a commitment to leveraging technology to enhance the customer value proposition.5 Internally, management has highlighted the use of AI to automate manual processes, which is a key contributor to the company's ongoing margin expansion.29

Financial Forecasts: Projecting Durable Growth

Our financial forecasts for S&P Global are built upon a foundation of consistent mid-to-high single-digit organic revenue growth, steady margin expansion driven by operating leverage and technological efficiencies, and a disciplined capital return program. We model each business segment individually, considering its unique market drivers and competitive positioning.

Key Forecast Assumptions (2025-2029)

Revenue: We forecast a consolidated revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.8% from fiscal 2024 to 2029, with revenues projected to reach $19.7 billion in 2029. This trajectory is broadly in line with consensus analyst estimates, which project revenues of approximately $15.2 billion in 2025, $16.3 billion in 2026, and $17.5 billion in 2027.28 Our segment-level assumptions include mid-single-digit growth for Ratings, Commodity Insights, and Mobility; high-single-digit growth for Market Intelligence, fueled by new product adoption and pricing; and mid-single-digit growth for Indices, driven by secular growth in passive investing.
Adjusted Operating Margin: We model a gradual but consistent margin expansion of 30-40 basis points per year. We project the adjusted operating margin will increase from an estimated 49.0% in 2025 to approximately 50.5% by 2029. This expansion reflects the benefits of scale, pricing power, and AI-driven productivity gains, which we expect to more than offset ongoing growth investments. This forecast aligns with management's long-term financial targets.14
Adjusted Diluted EPS: We forecast an adjusted EPS CAGR of approximately 11.5%, with EPS expected to reach $26.50 in 2029. This double-digit growth is a function of the combination of solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and a consistent 1.5-2.0% annual reduction in the share count via buybacks. Our estimates are consistent with the consensus analyst trajectory, which projects EPS growing from ~$17.38 in 2025 to ~$26.30 in 2029.28
Free Cash Flow: We anticipate free cash flow (FCF) conversion will remain strong, with FCF growing from an estimated $5.7 billion in 2025 to over $7.5 billion by the end of our forecast period in 2029, providing substantial capacity for capital returns and strategic investments.

Valuation: Reaching a $575 Price Target

Our 12-month price target of $575.00 is derived from a 50/50 blend of a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis and a forward P/E multiple analysis based on a peer group of high-quality financial data providers. S&P Global's current valuation is undeniably rich, with a trailing twelve-month P/E of 37.6x and a forward P/E on our 2025 estimate of 32.2x.36 This premium multiple is, in our view, justified by the company's superior business model, characterized by its wide economic moat, high and expanding margins, and strong return on invested capital.6

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

We employ a two-stage DCF model to estimate the intrinsic value of the firm based on its future cash generation potential. We project unlevered free cash flows over a 10-year explicit forecast period (through 2034) and then calculate a terminal value based on a perpetual growth methodology.
Key Assumptions:
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): We use a WACC of 8.5%. This is based on a risk-free rate of 4.36% (reflecting the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield in July 2025), an equity risk premium of 5.5%, and a 5-year beta of 1.19.12
Terminal Growth Rate ($g$): We assume a terminal growth rate of 3.0%, which serves as a reasonable long-term proxy for nominal global GDP growth.
Result: Our DCF analysis yields an intrinsic value of approximately $565 per share. The table below provides a summary of the DCF valuation and a sensitivity analysis showing how the derived value changes with different WACC and terminal growth rate assumptions.

Comparable Company Analysis

For our multiple-based valuation, we benchmark S&P Global against its closest peers in the high-quality financial data and ratings industry: Moody's Corporation (MCO) and MSCI Inc. (MSCI).5
S&P Global currently trades at a forward P/E of 32.2x our 2025 EPS estimate. This represents a slight discount to the forward multiples of MCO (approximately 35x) and MSCI (approximately 33x).5 Considering S&P Global's more diversified and arguably more resilient business mix, coupled with a comparable long-term growth profile, a target multiple that is at a premium to its own historical average is warranted. We believe a forward P/E multiple of 31.0x is appropriate. Applying this target multiple to our 2026E Adjusted EPS forecast of $18.90 and discounting the result back one year at our cost of equity (10.8%) yields a price target of approximately $585 per share.
Blending our DCF-derived value of $565 and our multiple-based value of $585 results in our final 12-month price target of $575.00. This target implies approximately 4.3% share price appreciation from the July 31, 2025 closing price, for a total expected return of ~5.0% including the dividend. This limited upside supports our initial HOLD rating.

Risk Assessment

While S&P Global's wide economic moat and resilient business model provide significant protection, investors should be aware of several key risks that could impact the company's performance and stock valuation.

Macroeconomic Risks

Interest Rates and Debt Issuance: The Ratings segment, a significant contributor to profitability, exhibits sensitivity to the health of global debt capital markets. A prolonged period of high interest rates, a sharp economic downturn, or a credit crisis could suppress corporate bond and structured finance issuance volumes, which would directly and negatively impact transaction-based revenue.5
Equity Market Volatility: A portion of the Indices segment's revenue is derived from asset-linked fees based on the market value of ETFs and other investment products that track its benchmarks. A significant and sustained downturn in global equity markets would reduce assets under management (AUM) and the corresponding fee revenue.43

Regulatory and Legal Risks

Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny: As one of the "Big Three" Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs), S&P Global operates under intense and continuously evolving regulatory oversight in the U.S., Europe, and other key jurisdictions. Any perceived failures in rating methodologies or accuracy, particularly in the event of a major corporate or sovereign default, could trigger governmental investigations, new and more onerous regulations, significant fines, or civil litigation. Such events pose a substantial headline risk that could damage the company's invaluable brand and reputation, in addition to direct financial costs.42

Competitive and Operational Risks

Technological Disruption and AI: The financial information industry is subject to rapid technological change. While S&P Global is investing heavily in AI, there is a risk that new or existing competitors could leverage generative AI or other emerging technologies to develop disruptive products that challenge S&P Global's market position. Failure to innovate at a sufficient pace could lead to market share erosion over the long term, particularly in the highly competitive Market Intelligence segment.42
Cybersecurity Threats: S&P Global is a custodian of vast quantities of market-sensitive and confidential financial data. A successful, large-scale cybersecurity breach that results in data theft or system disruption would represent a severe operational, financial, and reputational crisis, potentially leading to loss of client trust, regulatory penalties, and significant remediation costs.42
M&A Integration: The company is still realizing synergies from the large-scale 2022 merger with IHS Markit while simultaneously integrating new acquisitions like "With Intelligence." Any failure to successfully integrate these businesses, achieve projected cost and revenue synergies, and maintain cultural cohesion could negatively impact financial results and distract management.42
Despite these risks, it is important to note that Morningstar assigns S&P Global a "Low" Uncertainty Rating.46 This rating reflects the high predictability of the company's subscription-based revenues, its modest financial leverage, and the low probability that any single contingent event could materially impair its long-term intrinsic value.47 This low level of earnings uncertainty is a key factor supporting the stock's premium valuation.

ESG Considerations

S&P Global maintains a strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile, which we view as a net positive for the investment case. The company's ESG performance is rated by Sustainalytics, a leading independent research firm.
Sustainalytics assigns S&P Global an ESG Risk Rating of 15.05, which falls into the "Low Risk" category.48 This score indicates that the company has a low level of unmanaged ESG-related risk to its enterprise value. The rating places S&P Global in a favorable position relative to its peers in the Financial Exchanges and Data Services subindustry.48
For a data-centric business like S&P Global, the most material ESG issues are not primarily environmental but rather fall under the social and governance pillars. These include:
Corporate Governance: Maintaining robust governance practices is paramount to preserving the integrity and independence of its ratings and benchmarks, which is the foundation of its brand and moat.49
Data Privacy & Cybersecurity: Protecting client data and ensuring the security of its platforms is a critical operational and reputational imperative.48
Human Capital: The ability to attract, develop, and retain top-tier analytical and technological talent is essential for innovation and maintaining a competitive edge.49
The company's controversy level is rated as low, with no significant incidents noted that would materially impact the investment thesis.48
From an investment perspective, S&P Global's strong ESG profile reinforces its status as a high-quality, "blue-chip" company.3 Its diligent management of key risks like data security and its focus on ethical governance are integral to maintaining the client trust that underpins its economic moat. This reduces the probability of a major ESG-related controversy that could impair shareholder value. Furthermore, through its Sustainable1 division and the integration of ESG scores and data into its product suite, S&P Global is also well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainability-focused data and analytics from investors and corporations worldwide.50

Investment Thesis & Recommendation

An Overweight rating is initiated on Wells Fargo & Company with a 12-month price target of $95.00. The June 2025 removal of the Federal Reserve's restrictive asset cap represents a pivotal strategic inflection point for the company, fundamentally altering its investment narrative from a multi-year remediation and capital preservation story to one of profitable growth and aggressive capital deployment.2 Management has articulated a credible medium-term target of achieving a 17-18% Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE), a substantial step-up from the 15.2% delivered in the second quarter of 2025 and a dramatic improvement from the 8% ROTCE recorded in 2020.4 The current market valuation, in our view, fails to fully discount this enhanced earnings power and the significant capital return potential unlocked by a new $40 billion share repurchase program.6
The investment thesis rests on four key pillars:
Unleashed Growth Potential: The removal of the asset cap, which had constrained balance sheet growth since 2018, unshackles the company and allows it to compete on a level playing field for both loan and deposit growth.2 This newfound flexibility is critical for unlocking operating leverage and enabling strategic investments in higher-return business lines that were previously capacity-constrained.7 The ability to deploy its massive ~$1.3 trillion deposit base more effectively into earning assets is a primary driver of future revenue growth.8
A Credible Path to Superior Returns: The 17-18% ROTCE target is not merely aspirational but is supported by a clear and achievable strategy.4 This strategy combines renewed top-line growth with ongoing expense discipline and, crucially, a more efficient capital structure. Management has explicitly guided to a lower Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio target of 10-10.5%, down from the current 11.1% level, which will mechanically boost returns by reducing the equity base against which profits are measured.4
Aggressive Capital Return Underscores Value: The scale of the new $40 billion share repurchase authorization, equivalent to approximately 15% of the company's market capitalization as of early July 2025, signals profound management conviction in the stock's undervaluation and provides a powerful, tangible catalyst for earnings per share (EPS) accretion.6 This is further augmented by a planned 12.5% increase in the common stock dividend, enhancing the total shareholder return profile.5
Persistent Valuation Disconnect: Despite demonstrable operational progress, a strengthened balance sheet, and the removal of its primary regulatory overhang, Wells Fargo continues to trade at a notable discount to best-in-class peers on key metrics such as Price-to-Tangible-Book-Value (P/TBV) when adjusted for returns. As the company delivers consistent progress toward its new return targets, a significant narrowing of this valuation gap is anticipated.
The central catalyst underpinning this thesis is the newfound credibility of the company's strategic objectives. While the 17-18% ROTCE target was previously communicated, its achievability was questionable as long as the asset cap remained in place.2 A strategy reliant solely on cost reduction and business mix optimization is inherently slow and fraught with execution challenges. The removal of the cap, however, validates the entire strategic pivot. It transforms the company's posture from defense—focused on remediation and capital building—to offense, centered on growth and capital optimization. This event turns the ROTCE target from a distant aspiration into a plausible, executable plan, providing the market with a clear and compelling reason to re-evaluate the company's long-term earnings potential.

Q2 2025 Earnings Review: Executing Through Uncertainty

Wells Fargo reported a strong set of financial results for the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating solid execution against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty related to interest rate policy and international trade. The company delivered diluted EPS of $1.60, representing a 20% increase year-over-year (YoY) and a 15% increase sequentially from the first quarter.5 Net income rose 12% YoY to $5.5 billion, reflecting both top-line growth and disciplined expense management.5

Revenue Analysis: A Tale of Two Incomes

Total revenue for the quarter was $20.8 billion, up 1% from the prior-year period, showcasing a deliberate and successful shift in the company's revenue composition.8
Net Interest Income (NII): NII came in at $11.7 billion, down 2% YoY.8 This decline was primarily driven by the impact of lower market interest rates on the yield of floating-rate assets and a continued shift by customers into higher-yielding deposit products.10 However, on a sequential basis, NII grew a healthy 2%, benefiting from lower deposit costs, one additional day in the quarter, higher securities yields, and modest loan growth.8 The Net Interest Margin (NIM) for the quarter was 2.68%.5
Noninterest Income: In contrast to the pressure on NII, noninterest income grew a robust 4% YoY to $9.1 billion.5 This growth was underpinned by several factors, including a $253 million gain associated with the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company's merchant services joint venture, as well as higher asset-based fees in the Wealth and Investment Management segment, which benefited from higher market valuations.8
The divergent trends between NII and noninterest income are not indicative of underlying weakness but rather a clear sign of a successful strategic pivot. While the entire banking sector remains exposed to the cyclical pressures of interest rate movements on spread income, Wells Fargo is actively constructing more durable, fee-based revenue streams. The merchant services joint venture transaction is a prime example of this strategy in action; it provides not only a one-time gain but also a structural enhancement to the recurring card fee revenue line going forward.8 This de-risking of the overall revenue mix should, over time, lead to more predictable earnings through economic cycles and command a higher valuation multiple from the market.

Expense Management: Discipline Continues to Pay Off

Noninterest expense was well-controlled at $13.4 billion, rising only 1% YoY despite persistent inflationary pressures across the economy.8 This performance is a testament to management's sustained focus on driving operational efficiencies throughout the organization. The efficiency ratio, a key measure of productivity, improved markedly to 64% from 69% in the prior quarter, placing the company on a clear trajectory toward its long-term goal of sub-60%.3 This continued expense discipline is crucial as it provides the financial capacity to self-fund necessary investments in technology and growth initiatives without compromising profitability.

Credit Quality: Benign and Well-Provisioned

Credit performance remains a cornerstone of Wells Fargo's financial strength. Net charge-offs (NCOs) were a modest 0.44% of average loans on an annualized basis, a notable improvement from 0.57% in the prior-year quarter.5 The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, down 19% YoY, reflecting the stable credit environment and the strength of the loan portfolio.5
The company maintains a robust reserve position, with the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) for loans standing at $14.6 billion, or 1.58% of total loans.5 This provides a substantial cushion to absorb potential future credit normalization. The reserve for the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) office portfolio is particularly conservative, with an ACL of 7.9% of loans in that segment, reflecting a prudent approach to this challenged asset class.8

The Main Event: Life After the Asset Cap

The official removal of the Federal Reserve's asset cap in June 2025 is the single most significant catalyst for Wells Fargo's equity story.2 This regulatory constraint, imposed in 2018, has artificially suppressed the company's growth, profitability, and returns relative to its peers for over seven years. Its termination, coupled with the successful closure of thirteen separate consent orders since 2019, signals that the company has made substantial and credible progress in remediating its past operational and control deficiencies, heralding a new era for the institution.5

From Remediation to Reinvestment

For years, a substantial portion of management's attention and the company's expense base has been necessarily diverted toward building a risk and control framework appropriate for a systemically important bank.11 The lifting of the asset cap allows for a decisive strategic pivot, enabling the reallocation of both financial and human capital away from remediation and toward value-accretive growth initiatives. This shift marks the end of a long period of introspection and the beginning of a new phase focused on competitive execution and market share gains.

Unlocking the Path to 17-18% ROTCE

The new medium-term ROTCE target of 17-18% is the quantitative embodiment of this strategic pivot, and there is a clear, multi-faceted path to achieving this goal.4
Balance Sheet Growth: The most direct impact of the asset cap removal is the ability to grow the balance sheet. This allows Wells Fargo to deploy its significant and stable low-cost deposit base, which averages over $1.3 trillion, into new loan originations and other earning assets, directly driving NII growth and enhancing operating leverage.8
Investment in High-Return Segments: Management has explicitly identified several business lines with higher return profiles as key areas for investment, including credit cards, wealth management, and Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB).3 The asset cap removal provides the balance sheet capacity required to support expansion in these areas, such as extending more credit in investment banking transactions or growing the credit card loan portfolio.
Capital Efficiency: A critical, and perhaps underappreciated, lever for achieving higher returns is the optimization of the capital base. Management's stated goal to manage the CET1 ratio down to a range of 10-10.5% from the current 11.1% is a crucial component of the strategy.4 By operating with a leaner but still robust capital position, the company can generate its earnings on a smaller base of equity. This reduction in the denominator of the ROTCE calculation ($Net\ Income / Tangible\ Common\ Equity$) provides a powerful, mechanical lift to the ratio.
The removal of the asset cap creates a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle that can drive significant value creation. First, renewed balance sheet growth leads directly to higher revenue. Second, as this new revenue is generated, the company's ongoing expense discipline ensures that a larger portion of each incremental dollar of revenue drops to the bottom line, improving the efficiency ratio and expanding pre-provision profit. Third, management's plan to optimize the capital structure by reducing the target CET1 ratio means that this higher level of profit will be generated on a more efficient, smaller capital base. The combination of a growing numerator (Net Income) and a shrinking or more slowly growing denominator (Tangible Common Equity, aided by buybacks) results in a non-linear, or "multiplied," positive impact on ROTCE. This is the financial engine that is expected to drive the re-rating of the stock as the market begins to price in this enhanced return profile.

Segment Deep Dive: Engines of Future Growth

An analysis of Wells Fargo's four reportable operating segments reveals distinct opportunities for growth and profitability improvement in the post-asset cap environment.

Consumer Banking and Lending (CBL)

In 2Q25, the CBL segment saw average loans of $315.4 billion, a decrease of 3% YoY, while average deposits remained stable at $781.4 billion.5 Despite the loan balance decline, the segment generated net income of $1.86 billion, a 5% YoY increase, demonstrating improved profitability.5 This segment is poised to be a primary beneficiary of the company's newfound ability to grow. A key strategic focus is the credit card business, where the company has launched 11 new products since 2021 and has the opportunity to increase penetration within its vast existing customer base.12 Leveraging its extensive branch network, which ranks #2 in the U.S., to drive consumer loan growth and deepen customer relationships will be paramount.12

Commercial Banking (CB)

The CB segment, which serves middle-market companies, showed steady performance in 2Q25, with average loans growing 1% YoY to $226.5 billion and average deposits growing a strong 7% to $178.0 billion.5 This segment represents a stable, core business that provides foundational lending relationships across the country. The primary strategic opportunity within CB is to enhance cross-selling of higher-fee products from the Corporate & Investment Banking and Wealth & Investment Management divisions to its established base of middle-market clients.

Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB)

CIB is emerging as a primary engine of growth for Wells Fargo. The segment demonstrated strong momentum in 2Q25, with average loans growing 4% YoY to $285.9 billion.5 This was complemented by a 9% YoY increase in investment banking fees during the quarter.8 The company has been successfully gaining market share, claiming the #1 ranking in U.S. Investment Grade M&A Bookrunning for loan syndications in the first half of 2025.13 The strategic focus is on continuing to build out these capabilities and capturing a larger share of the investment banking wallet from its corporate clients. The ability to commit more of its balance sheet to financing transactions is a direct and immediate benefit of the asset cap removal.

Wealth & Investment Management (WIM)

The WIM segment showed very strong signs of stabilization and growth in 2Q25, with average deposits surging 20% YoY to $123.6 billion.5 Asset-based fee income also grew, reflecting the positive impact of higher market valuations.8 Management has acknowledged that this business requires revitalization and investment to improve its competitive positioning.3 The strategic focus will be on stemming advisor attrition, recruiting new talent, and better leveraging the broader bank's affluent customer base to drive net asset flows. The strong deposit growth is an encouraging early indicator of renewed client confidence and engagement.

Fortress Balance Sheet & Aggressive Capital Return

Wells Fargo's ability to pivot to a growth-oriented strategy is underpinned by its exceptionally strong capital and liquidity position. The company ended the second quarter of 2025 with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%, comfortably above both its regulatory minimum and its new, lower Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement, which is expected to be approximately 2.6%.5 The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 121% also remains well above the 100% regulatory minimum, providing a substantial buffer against funding stress.5 This "fortress" balance sheet provides the foundation for a dual strategy of funding organic growth while simultaneously returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.

A New Era of Capital Deployment

The company has clearly signaled a more aggressive approach to capital returns following the positive results of the 2025 stress test and the removal of the asset cap.
$40 Billion Repurchase Program: In April 2025, the Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to $40 billion.6 The company has already demonstrated its intent to utilize this authorization, buying back $3.0 billion of common stock in 2Q25 and over $6 billion in the first half of 2025.5 This program provides a powerful and flexible tool to return excess capital and drive EPS growth.
Dividend Growth: Management has announced its expectation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend by 12.5%, from $0.40 to $0.45 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2025.5 This would bring the forward dividend yield to approximately 2.2% based on the current price, further enhancing the total return proposition for investors.
The magnitude of these capital return actions serves as a powerful strategic signal from management. A buyback authorization of this scale implies a strong conviction that the intrinsic value of the company's shares is significantly higher than the current market price. Furthermore, the decision to pursue large-scale repurchases while simultaneously communicating an intention to manage toward a lower target CET1 ratio demonstrates a fundamental shift in capital management philosophy.4 The company is moving decisively from a posture of capital accumulation, where excess capital was held to satisfy regulatory concerns, to one of capital optimization. In this new phase, excess capital is being deployed to its most efficient and value-accretive use, which management clearly believes is repurchasing its own stock. This dual action is designed to maximize shareholder value by directly increasing EPS through share count reduction while also signaling deep undervaluation to the broader market.

Valuation Framework: Pricing in the Turnaround

Despite its recent share price appreciation, Wells Fargo's valuation does not yet fully reflect its transformed operating profile and enhanced growth prospects. On a relative basis, the company trades at a Price/Normalized Earnings ratio of 14.66x and a Price/Book Value of 1.65x.3 This represents a significant valuation discount to its closest peer, JPMorgan (JPM), which trades at a Price/Book multiple of 2.40x.3
In the banking sector, valuation is fundamentally tethered to profitability, with ROTCE serving as the primary determinant of the multiple investors are willing to pay on tangible book value. JPMorgan has historically and justifiably commanded a premium valuation due to its consistent delivery of superior ROTCE. With Wells Fargo now targeting a 17-18% ROTCE, a level that is directly comparable to JPMorgan's own long-term target, the argument for a substantial expansion of Wells Fargo's valuation multiple is compelling.4

Price Target Methodology

The $95.00 price target is derived by applying a 2.0x multiple to a forward 12-month Tangible Book Value per Share (TBVPS) estimate of $47.50.
A 2.0x P/TBV multiple is justified for a large-cap U.S. bank that can sustainably generate a 17-18% ROTCE. This multiple remains conservative relative to JPMorgan's current multiple, reflecting a prudent discount for the execution risk associated with Wells Fargo's ongoing transformation as it works to consistently deliver on its new targets.
The forward TBVPS estimate of $47.50 is based on projected retained earnings growth, driven by our earnings forecast, and the accretive impact of the share repurchase program, which reduces the share count.
As Wells Fargo continues to execute on its strategy—growing its balance sheet, improving its efficiency ratio, and optimizing its capital base—and delivers consistent progress toward its 17-18% ROTCE goal, the market is expected to gradually close the valuation gap with best-in-class peers, driving the share price toward our target.

Navigating the Macro and Industry Landscape


Macroeconomic Outlook

The investment thesis is set against a macroeconomic backdrop of modest recovery and lingering uncertainty. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII) anticipates a modest global growth recovery in 2025, led by the U.S., but acknowledges significant risks stemming from U.S. tariff policy and the potential for heightened market volatility.15 Inflation is projected to slow in the first half of 2025 before potentially firming in the second half as the economy reaccelerates.15 This "soft landing" scenario is generally supportive for bank credit quality, as it avoids a sharp rise in unemployment and corporate defaults. However, the uncertainty surrounding trade policy remains a key headwind for business confidence and investment.17
The interest rate environment has been a headwind for NII. As of mid-July 2025, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 4.50%.19 While lower rates have compressed asset yields, the expectation of a relatively stable rate environment going forward reduces the risk of further significant unrealized losses in banks' available-for-sale securities portfolios, which was a major concern in previous years.

Industry Risks

The banking industry continues to navigate a complex and evolving landscape characterized by several key risks:
Regulatory Complexity: While Wells Fargo has made significant strides in resolving its company-specific issues, the broader regulatory environment for large banks remains demanding. Increasing fragmentation between U.S. and international standards, particularly concerning the final implementation of Basel 3.1 rules, creates ongoing compliance costs and operational challenges for globally active firms.20
Competition from Non-Banks: The competitive landscape continues to be reshaped by the growth of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The rise of private credit, in particular, has created a formidable competitor for traditional corporate lending, while fintech firms continue to challenge incumbents in payments, consumer lending, and wealth management.22
Technological Disruption: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents both a significant opportunity and a potential threat. While AI can be leveraged to drive substantial efficiency gains and enhance customer experiences, it also has the potential to disrupt traditional banking business models, particularly if third-party AI agents gain traction with consumers for managing their financial affairs, thereby eroding customer inertia and pressuring bank profitability.22

Key Investment Risks

While the investment thesis is compelling, it is subject to several key risks that could impede the achievement of our price target.
Macroeconomic Downturn: A sharper-than-expected economic slowdown or a full-blown recession would represent the most significant risk. Such a scenario would lead to deteriorating credit quality, higher loan losses, and reduced loan demand across both consumer and commercial segments. This would directly and negatively impact earnings, challenging the core assumptions of our financial model.
Execution Risk: The investment thesis is fundamentally predicated on management's ability to successfully execute its strategic pivot and achieve its 17-18% ROTCE target. Potential pitfalls include a failure to maintain expense discipline, an inability to successfully invest in and grow targeted business lines, or a misstep in managing the company's capital base. Any significant failure in execution would undermine the path to higher returns and delay or prevent the anticipated valuation re-rating.
Interest Rate Volatility: The base case assumes a relatively stable interest rate environment. However, a sudden and sharp increase or decrease in interest rates could negatively impact NII and NIM beyond current expectations. A rapid rise in rates could create renewed pressure on the valuation of the securities portfolio, while a rapid fall could accelerate margin compression.
Regulatory and Reputational Setbacks: Despite making substantial progress in resolving past issues, Wells Fargo remains subject to several open consent orders. The emergence of any new regulatory problems, significant fines, or negative headlines related to conduct could damage investor sentiment, distract management, and delay the company's strategic progress. The company's "Medium" ESG Risk Rating of 26.06 from Sustainalytics and a "Significant" controversy level highlight residual risks in sensitive areas such as business ethics, product governance, and data privacy that require ongoing vigilance.24

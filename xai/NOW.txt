### Analyst Note
ServiceNow reported strong Q2 2025 results on July 23, 2025, with subscription revenues reaching $3,113 million, reflecting 22.5% year-over-year growth and 21.5% in constant currency [1]. This performance exceeded expectations, driven by robust demand for the company's AI-powered Now Platform, particularly in IT service management and customer workflows. Total revenues were approximately $3,222 million, incorporating professional services, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding to 30.5% from 27.8% a year ago, aided by operational efficiencies and scale [2]. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $4.09, surpassing consensus estimates of $3.57 by 14.57%, marking the company's continued trend of beating forecasts [3].

The quarter highlighted accelerating adoption of generative AI features, such as Now Assist, which contributed to a 25% increase in remaining performance obligations to an estimated $18 billion [4]. Key deals included expansions with large enterprises in financial services and healthcare, underscoring ServiceNow's entrenchment in digital transformation initiatives. However, macroeconomic headwinds, including elongated sales cycles in Europe, tempered guidance for Q3 subscription revenue growth at 20-21% [1].

Our investment thesis remains intact: ServiceNow is well-positioned as a leader in enterprise software, benefiting from secular shifts toward cloud-based automation and AI integration. We maintain our wide moat rating, supported by high switching costs and network effects. That said, valuation appears stretched at current multiples, with the stock trading at 12x forward sales post-earnings rally. We raise our fair value estimate to $950 from $900, incorporating higher revenue projections and margin expansion, implying 11% upside from the July 24 close of $856 [5]. This adjustment reflects optimism around AI-driven growth but factors in potential volatility from economic uncertainty. Medium-term, we expect 20% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by platform expansions, though competition from Microsoft and Salesforce could pressure market share. Overall, the Q2 beat reinforces our view of ServiceNow as a core holding for growth-oriented investors, albeit with caution on near-term execution risks.

### Business Description
ServiceNow provides a cloud-based platform that automates and manages digital workflows for enterprises. Its core offerings include IT service management, customer service management, HR service delivery, and security operations, all built on the Now Platform [6]. The company generates over 95% of revenues from subscriptions, with the remainder from professional services [1]. Geographically, approximately 60% of revenues come from the United States, 25% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 15% from Asia-Pacific [7].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
ServiceNow's competitive edge stems from its integrated platform approach, enabling seamless workflow automation across IT, HR, and customer functions. The company invests heavily in AI and machine learning, with features like Now Assist driving productivity gains for clients [1]. This positions ServiceNow to capitalize on secular trends such as digital transformation and the shift to hybrid work environments, where enterprises seek unified platforms to reduce silos.

In the medium term, ServiceNow aims to expand its total addressable market through partnerships, including integrations with Microsoft Azure and AWS, and targeted acquisitions to bolster AI capabilities [8]. Revenue growth is expected to moderate to 18-22% annually over the next three years, supported by cross-selling to existing customers, where average contract values have risen 15% year-over-year [4].

Looking ahead, challenges include intensifying competition, but ServiceNow's focus on innovation and customer retention—evidenced by a 98% renewal rate—should sustain its leadership [1]. By 2027, AI-related revenues are projected to comprise 30% of total, fueling margin expansion amid cost controls [9].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- ServiceNow's AI integrations, like Now Assist, are accelerating adoption, with Q2 deals showing 25% growth in high-value contracts [1].  
- High switching costs and a 98% renewal rate lock in customers, supporting predictable revenue streams [1].  
- Expansion into new verticals, such as public sector and healthcare, diversifies revenue and taps untapped markets [8].  

**Bears Say**  
- Macroeconomic pressures are elongating sales cycles, potentially capping growth below 20% in FY2026 [1].  
- Intense competition from Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce could erode market share in customer workflows [10].  
- Elevated valuation at 12x sales leaves little room for error if AI hype fails to deliver sustained margins [5].

### Economic Moat
ServiceNow maintains a wide economic moat, primarily driven by switching costs and network effects. Customers invest significant time and resources integrating the Now Platform into their operations, making transitions to competitors costly and disruptive—evidenced by a 98% subscription renewal rate in Q2 2025 [1]. Network effects amplify this, as the platform's value increases with more users and third-party apps, creating an ecosystem with over 1,800 integrations [6]. Intangible assets, including proprietary AI algorithms, further entrench its position, with R&D spending at 24% of revenues supporting innovation [7].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a five-year revenue CAGR of 20%, slowing from 22.5% in Q2 2025 [1] to 15% by 2029, driven by AI adoption and market expansion. Operating margins are projected to expand from 9.3% in FY2023 to 30% by 2029, reflecting scale efficiencies and pricing power [11]. We apply a WACC of 9.0%, incorporating a 3% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.2 [12].

EPS bridge: Starting from FY2024 EPS of $12.50, we forecast growth to $16.00 in FY2025 (+28%), driven by 22% revenue growth and 2-point margin expansion, reaching $35.00 by 2029. This yields a terminal value at 25x EPS, discounted back to a fair value of $950 per share, implying a forward P/E of 50x and EV/sales of 13x on FY2026 estimates.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macroeconomic slowdowns could extend sales cycles, as noted in Q2 guidance [1], potentially reducing revenue by 5-10%. Regulatory risks include data privacy laws like GDPR, which may increase compliance costs [13]. ESG factors, such as energy consumption from data centers, pose operational risks amid rising scrutiny. Competitive pressures from AI entrants could swing valuation by 15-20%. We rate uncertainty as medium due to these factors.

### Capital Allocation
ServiceNow's balance sheet is strong, with $5.2 billion in cash and low debt (debt-to-equity 0.2) as of Q2 2025 [1]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted deals, such as AI startups, avoiding overpayment [8]. The company prioritizes share buybacks, repurchasing $1.5 billion in FY2024, and initiated a dividend in 2024 [14]. This supports an exemplary rating.

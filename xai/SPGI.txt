### Analyst Note
S&P Global reported Q2 2025 results on July 31, 2025, with EPS increasing 10% year-over-year [2]. This performance aligns with the company's history of beating earnings estimates, having surpassed consensus in the past four quarters by an average of 7.5% [3]. The results reflect strength in core segments, including ratings and market intelligence, amid a stable economic environment for financial services. Revenue growth was driven by demand for data analytics and benchmarks, though specific quarterly figures are not detailed in available sources.

The thesis for S&P Global remains centered on its dominant position in credit ratings and financial data, bolstered by the 2022 merger with IHS Markit, which expanded its capabilities in commodity insights and mobility. Medium-term outlook is positive, with forecasts indicating free cash flow of $6 billion for FY2025, implying a 3.7% yield based on current market capitalization [1]. This supports ongoing capital returns, including dividends and buybacks. However, macro uncertainties, such as interest rate volatility, could impact transaction volumes in ratings.

Valuation appears reasonable, with our fair value estimate of $550 implying a forward P/E of 30x on projected FY2025 EPS. This incorporates an 8% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by secular trends in ESG data and AI integration. Uncertainty is rated medium due to regulatory risks in the ratings industry and competition from alternative data providers. Capital allocation is exemplary, with disciplined M&A and consistent shareholder returns.

Overall, the Q2 results reinforce our view of S&P Global as a high-quality compounder in financial information services. We maintain a buy recommendation for long-term investors, though near-term stock performance may be influenced by market sentiment on economic growth. Key risks include potential slowdowns in capital markets activity, which could pressure non-subscription revenue. Upside potential stems from expanding margins to 45% by 2027 through cost synergies and operational efficiency. (312 words)

### Business Description
S&P Global provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions to global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. Key segments include Ratings (credit assessments), Market Intelligence (data and research), Commodity Insights (energy and commodity data), Mobility (automotive intelligence), and Indices (market benchmarks like the S&P 500) [4]. The company operates globally, with approximately 60% of revenue from the Americas, 25% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 15% from Asia-Pacific [4].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
S&P Global leverages its scale and data assets to maintain competitive advantages in a fragmented industry. The strategy focuses on integrating acquisitions, such as IHS Markit, to enhance product offerings and cross-sell opportunities across segments. Investments in technology, including AI for analytics, aim to improve client retention and expand into high-growth areas like sustainable finance [4]. Competitive edge stems from high switching costs for clients reliant on S&P's ratings and indices, which are embedded in financial contracts and regulations.

Secular trends favor the company, including increased demand for ESG-related data and transparency in supply chains, driven by regulatory changes in Europe and the US. Digital transformation in financial services supports growth in subscription-based revenue, which comprises about 80% of total, providing stability [4]. Medium-term view projects 7-9% annual revenue growth through 2027, with margin expansion from cost controls and pricing power.

Challenges include intensifying competition from firms like Moody's and Bloomberg, but S&P Global's broad portfolio positions it well for market share gains. Outlook assumes moderate global GDP growth; a recession could reduce issuance volumes in ratings, while recovery would boost them.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- Strong demand for data analytics and ESG products drives subscription revenue growth [4].  
- Forecasted $6 billion in free cash flow for 2025 supports robust capital returns [1].  
- Dominant market position in credit ratings provides pricing power and recurring income.  

**Bears Say**  
- Regulatory scrutiny on ratings agencies could increase compliance costs and limit fees.  
- Competition from alternative data providers may erode market share in intelligence segments.  
- Macroeconomic slowdowns could reduce transaction-based revenue in volatile markets [3].

### Economic Moat
S&P Global possesses a wide economic moat, primarily from intangible assets and network effects. Its credit ratings business holds a near-duopoly with Moody's, rating over 95% of global debt issuances, creating high barriers to entry due to regulatory recognition and client reliance [4]. Network effects are evident in indices, where the S&P 500 benchmark is used in trillions of dollars of assets, reinforcing its standard status.

Evidence includes consistent ROIC above 10% and operating margins exceeding 40% in recent years, indicating superior profitability [4]. The moat is sustained by brand reputation and data scale, with limited successful entrants in core markets over decades.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our valuation model assumes a 8% revenue CAGR from FY2024 to FY2029, driven by 6% organic growth and 2% from acquisitions, reaching $20B by FY2029. Operating margins expand from 42% in FY2024 to 45% by FY2027 through cost synergies, then stabilize. WACC is estimated at 8%, reflecting a beta of 1.0 and cost of equity of 9%.

EPS bridge starts from FY2024 estimated $10.50, adding $1.50 from revenue growth, $0.50 from margin expansion, minus $0.50 for higher taxes and interest, yielding FY2025 EPS of $12.00. Terminal growth of 4% post-2029 leads to a fair value of $550 per share, implying a FY2025 P/E of 46x and EV/EBITDA of 25x, aligned with historical premiums for moat quality.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include interest rate fluctuations affecting debt issuance volumes, potentially reducing ratings revenue by 10-15% in a downturn [3]. Regulatory risks involve antitrust scrutiny on market dominance and ESG disclosure mandates, which could raise costs. ESG risks center on data accuracy in sustainability ratings, with potential reputational damage. Operational risks include cybersecurity threats to data platforms. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with fair value sensitivity of ±20% under stress scenarios.

### Capital Allocation
Balance sheet is strong, with net debt/EBITDA below 2x and investment-grade ratings [4]. M&A discipline is evident in the IHS Markit integration, delivering synergies ahead of schedule. Dividend policy targets 40% payout ratio, with 3% yield; buybacks average $2B annually when valuations are attractive [1]. Overall rating is exemplary due to shareholder-friendly actions without overleveraging.

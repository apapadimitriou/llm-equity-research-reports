### Analyst Note
The Cigna Group reported strong second-quarter 2025 results, with revenue reaching $67.2 billion, an 11% increase from the prior-year period, driven primarily by growth in the Evernorth Health Services segment [2]. This performance exceeded analyst expectations for revenue, though adjusted EPS of $7.20 fell slightly short of consensus estimates [4]. The results reflect robust demand for pharmacy benefit management services and specialty drug distribution, offsetting pressures from elevated medical costs in the Cigna Healthcare segment. Shares rose approximately 1% following the announcement, indicating market approval of the top-line beat despite margin headwinds [3].

Our thesis on Cigna remains intact, emphasizing its diversified business model as a key strength in a volatile healthcare landscape. The company's focus on cost management and value-based care positions it well for medium-term growth, particularly as healthcare spending trends toward efficiency. However, ongoing regulatory scrutiny and rising utilization rates pose risks to profitability. We maintain our wide moat rating, supported by Cigna's scale in pharmacy services and network effects. Our fair value estimate of $380 incorporates a projected revenue CAGR of 8% over the next five years, with operating margins stabilizing at 4.5%. This implies a forward P/E of 13x, aligned with historical averages.

Looking ahead, we anticipate full-year 2025 adjusted EPS in the range of $28.50-$29.50, up from $28.29 in 2024, based on continued momentum in Evernorth and moderating medical cost trends [1]. Macro factors, including potential changes in Medicare Advantage reimbursement, could influence the outlook. Cigna's capital deployment, including share repurchases and dividends, supports shareholder returns, with $4.2 billion returned in the first half of 2025. Overall, the Q2 results reinforce our view that Cigna is undervalued at current levels, offering upside potential amid secular trends in healthcare digitization and personalized medicine. We recommend monitoring upcoming regulatory developments, as they could impact the uncertainty rating.

### Business Description
The Cigna Group provides health insurance and related services primarily in the United States, with some international exposure. Key segments include Cigna Healthcare, which offers medical, pharmacy, and behavioral health plans to employers and individuals, and Evernorth Health Services, encompassing pharmacy benefit management, specialty pharmacy, and health services [1]. The company operates in over 30 countries, with the majority of revenue (over 90%) generated in the U.S. [1].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Cigna's competitive edge stems from its integrated model, combining insurance with pharmacy and health services to deliver cost-effective solutions. The company leverages data analytics and value-based care to reduce medical costs, differentiating it from pure-play insurers. Investments in technology, such as telehealth and AI-driven predictive modeling, enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency [1].

Secular trends favoring outsourced health services, including rising specialty drug demand and employer focus on employee wellness, support Cigna's growth. Medium-term, we expect expansion in Medicare Advantage and international markets, with potential for 8%-10% annual revenue growth through 2029.

However, challenges from regulatory changes and competitive pricing could pressure margins. Overall, Cigna's strategy positions it for sustained profitability in a consolidating industry.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**
- Strong growth in Evernorth, with Q2 2025 revenue up significantly, underscores Cigna's leadership in pharmacy services [2].
- Diversified revenue streams mitigate risks from medical cost inflation, supporting consistent earnings.
- Active share repurchases enhance EPS growth and shareholder value.

**Bears Say**
- Elevated medical costs and utilization in Cigna Healthcare led to EPS shortfall in Q2 2025 [4].
- Regulatory risks, including antitrust scrutiny on mergers, could limit expansion opportunities.
- Competition from vertically integrated peers may erode market share in key segments.

### Economic Moat
Cigna possesses a wide economic moat, primarily sourced from intangible assets and switching costs. Its proprietary pharmacy benefit management platform and extensive provider networks create high barriers to entry, as clients face significant disruption when changing providers [1]. Evidence includes Evernorth's 11% revenue growth in Q2 2025, driven by long-term contracts and scale advantages [2]. Network effects further strengthen the moat, with over 1,400 clients relying on integrated services [1].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 8% revenue CAGR from 2025 to 2029, driven by 10% growth in Evernorth and 6% in Cigna Healthcare, reflecting secular demand for specialty services. Operating margins are projected to expand from 4.2% in 2024 to 4.5% by 2029, aided by cost controls and scale efficiencies. We apply a WACC of 7.0%, incorporating a beta of 0.9 and cost of equity of 8.5%.

EPS bridge: Starting from 2024 adjusted EPS of $28.29, we add $1.50 from revenue growth, $0.70 from margin expansion, offset by $0.50 in higher taxes and interest, yielding 2025 EPS of $29.00. Terminal growth of 3% post-2029 leads to a fair value of $380, implying a 2025 P/E of 13.1x and EV/EBITDA of 9.5x.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include inflation-driven medical costs, potentially increasing the medical loss ratio above 82% [2]. Regulatory risks involve changes to Medicare Advantage rates or antitrust actions on pharmacy mergers. ESG risks center on data privacy breaches, while operational risks include cyber threats disrupting services. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with a potential valuation swing of ±20%.

### Capital Allocation
Cigna's balance sheet is strong, with debt-to-capital at 42% and cash reserves of $8.5 billion as of Q2 2025 [2]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions enhancing Evernorth capabilities. The company maintains a progressive dividend (yield 1.5%) and aggressive buybacks, repurchasing $3.5 billion in shares in 2024 [1]. This supports a standard capital allocation rating.

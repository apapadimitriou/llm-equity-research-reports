### Analyst Note
CrowdStrike Holdings reported Q1 FY2026 results on June 3, 2025, with total revenue of $1.1 billion, exceeding estimates of $1.1 billion, driven by strong adoption of its Falcon platform [1]. Ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached $4.44 billion, up 4.7% quarter-over-quarter and reflecting 21.6% year-over-year growth, with net new ARR of $194 million [1]. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.73, beating expectations of $0.66, while operating cash flow hit $384 million and free cash flow $279 million, both records for the quarter [1]. The company highlighted momentum in Falcon Flex deals, with total deal value exceeding $3.2 billion, up over 6x year-over-year [1].

Guidance for Q2 FY2026 projects revenue of $1.144 billion to $1.152 billion, implying 27-28% year-over-year growth, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 [1]. Full-year FY2026 guidance includes revenue of $4.78 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, aligning closely with analyst estimates [1]. These figures underscore CrowdStrike's resilience in the cybersecurity market amid rising threats, though competitive pressures from players like Palo Alto Networks and Microsoft persist [2].

The thesis remains intact: CrowdStrike's AI-powered endpoint protection and cloud security offerings position it for sustained growth in a sector expanding due to increasing cyber risks. However, recent ARR growth deceleration from 23% in FY2025 to 21.6% signals potential headwinds from market saturation or economic caution [3]. Valuation appears stretched at 10x FY2026 revenue, but improving margins—non-GAAP operating margin reached 25% in Q1 [1]—support a wide moat rating. We maintain a fair value estimate of $500, implying 10% upside from the June 4 close of $455.23, based on a discounted cash flow model assuming 25% revenue CAGR through FY2029. Risks include operational incidents, as seen in prior outages, which could erode customer trust [4]. Overall, CrowdStrike's platform consolidation trend favors long-term outperformance, though investors should monitor Q2 execution for signs of reacceleration.

### Business Description
CrowdStrike Holdings provides cloud-native cybersecurity solutions through its Falcon platform, which offers endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and incident response services. Key segments include subscription revenue, accounting for approximately 94% of total revenue, and professional services [3]. The company operates globally, with the United States generating about 70% of revenue, followed by Europe, Middle East, and Africa (15%), and Asia-Pacific (10%) [3].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
CrowdStrike's competitive edge stems from its single-agent, AI-driven Falcon platform, which integrates multiple security modules to reduce complexity and improve efficacy compared to legacy point solutions. This modular approach allows customers to adopt additional features seamlessly, driving higher ARR per customer—average deal sizes have grown with Falcon Flex offerings exceeding $3.2 billion in total value [1]. The company invests heavily in R&D, with focus on cloud security, which contributes 15% to revenue and grows at 90% year-over-year [4].

Secular trends favor CrowdStrike, including rising cyber threats, cloud migration, and AI adoption, which amplify data vulnerabilities. The global cybersecurity market is projected to grow at 12% CAGR through 2030, driven by regulatory requirements and breach frequency [2].

In the medium term (3-5 years), CrowdStrike is poised for 25-30% revenue growth, supported by platform expansion and market share gains in identity protection and log management. However, margin expansion to 30% by FY2028 depends on scaling efficiencies, amid competition from integrated suites like Microsoft's Defender [2]. Outlook remains positive, with FY2026 guidance indicating sustained momentum [1].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. CrowdStrike's ARR growth of 21.6% year-over-year and record Q1 free cash flow of $279 million demonstrate strong demand for its AI-powered platform [1].  
2. Falcon Flex momentum, with deal values over $3.2 billion, signals accelerating customer consolidation and potential for higher margins [1].  
3. Guidance for FY2026 revenue of $4.78 billion positions the company to capture share in a $100 billion+ cybersecurity market [1,2].  

**Bears Say**  
1. ARR growth slowed to 21.6% from 23% in FY2025, indicating possible market saturation or economic headwinds [3].  
2. Intense competition from Microsoft and Palo Alto could pressure pricing and market share [2].  
3. Valuation at 10x forward revenue appears elevated amid risks of operational disruptions [2].

### Economic Moat
CrowdStrike possesses a wide economic moat, primarily sourced from network effects and switching costs. The Falcon platform's data aggregation from over 1 trillion daily events creates a self-reinforcing threat intelligence network, improving detection accuracy and attracting more users [3]. High switching costs arise from deep integration into customer IT environments, with migration potentially disrupting operations—evidenced by 65% of Fortune 100 companies using Falcon [3]. Intangible assets, such as proprietary AI algorithms, further entrench its position, contributing to gross margins above 75% [1].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 25% revenue CAGR from FY2026 to FY2029, driven by ARR expansion and module adoption, tapering to 10% terminal growth. Operating margins are projected to expand from 25% in FY2026 to 30% by FY2029, reflecting scale efficiencies and reduced sales costs [1]. We apply a 10% WACC, incorporating a 7% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.2.

EPS bridge starts from FY2026 guidance of $3.50, adding $1.00 from margin gains and $0.50 from share dilution offset, reaching $5.00 by FY2029. This yields a fair value of $500 per share, implying 10.4x FY2026 revenue and 143x EPS multiples, reasonable given growth prospects.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic downturns reducing IT budgets, potentially slowing ARR additions [2]. Regulatory scrutiny on data privacy could increase compliance costs, especially in Europe. ESG factors involve data security breaches, which harmed reputation in past incidents [4]. Operational risks from software updates pose outage threats, as seen in July 2024, swinging valuation by 15-20% [4]. Uncertainty is rated high due to competitive dynamics and rapid tech evolution.

### Capital Allocation
CrowdStrike maintains a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion in cash and minimal debt, supporting R&D and acquisitions [3]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted buys like Humio for log management, enhancing platform without overpaying. The company does not pay dividends but uses buybacks opportunistically, repurchasing $500 million in shares in FY2025 [3]. This prudent approach earns an exemplary rating.

### Analyst Note
Adobe's fiscal Q2 2025 results, released on June 12, 2025, showed revenue of $5.9 billion, up 11% year over year, exceeding expectations by $70 million [1]. Non-GAAP EPS reached $5.06, beating estimates by $0.09 [1]. Digital Media annual recurring revenue grew 12% to $18.1 billion, driven by strength in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud segments [1]. Remaining performance obligations increased 10% to $19.7 billion, indicating solid future revenue visibility [1]. Management guided Q3 revenue to approximately $5.9 billion and raised full-year FY25 revenue guidance to $23.55 billion [1].

These results reflect Adobe's resilience amid economic pressures, with AI integrations like Firefly boosting user engagement and subscription uptake. However, the stock has faced headwinds, declining 36.93% over the past year as of mid-August 2025, stabilizing at $338.27 [2]. This drop stems from broader market concerns over tech valuations and competition in generative AI. Our thesis remains that Adobe's dominant position in creative software and shift to AI-driven tools will support mid-teens revenue growth over the medium term, though macroeconomic uncertainty could pressure discretionary spending.

We maintain a wide moat rating, underpinned by high switching costs and network effects in Adobe's ecosystem. Our fair value estimate of $400 implies a 18% upside from the June 13 close, based on a discounted cash flow model assuming 10% revenue CAGR through 2029, expanding operating margins to 48%, and a WACC of 8.5%. Key positives include AI monetization, with Firefly usage contributing to ARR growth. Risks include intensifying competition from open-source AI tools and potential regulatory scrutiny on data privacy.

Looking ahead, Adobe's strategic focus on AI enhancements positions it well for secular trends in digital content creation. However, bears point to slowing growth in mature segments and economic slowdowns affecting enterprise budgets. We see the current valuation as attractive for long-term investors, with shares trading at 20x forward EPS versus historical averages of 30x. Overall, Q2 performance reinforces our view of sustained profitability, though execution on AI initiatives will be critical to realizing upside.

### Business Description
Adobe Inc. develops software for content creation, document management, and digital marketing. Key segments include Digital Media (Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounting for about 75% of revenue), Digital Experience (analytics and marketing tools, about 25%), and Publishing (legacy products) [3]. The company operates globally, with approximately 60% of revenue from the Americas, 25% from EMEA, and 15% from APAC [3].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Adobe's competitive edge stems from its subscription-based model, which provides recurring revenue and locks in users through integrated ecosystems like Creative Cloud. The company has invested heavily in AI, with tools like Firefly enabling generative content creation, differentiating it from competitors such as Canva or open-source alternatives [4]. This strategy targets expanding markets in digital advertising and enterprise workflows, where Adobe holds over 50% share in professional creative software [5].

Secular trends favor Adobe, including the rise of remote work, e-commerce, and AI-driven automation. Demand for digital experiences is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2028, driven by cloud adoption [6]. In the medium term, Adobe aims to accelerate ARR growth to 13-15% by monetizing AI features via premium subscriptions.

Over the next 3-5 years, we expect Adobe to benefit from enterprise uptake of Experience Cloud, offsetting potential saturation in creative tools. However, success depends on navigating economic cycles, with FY25 guidance implying 10% overall growth [1].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- AI integrations like Firefly are driving higher ARR, with Digital Media growing 12% in Q2 FY25 [1].  
- Subscription model ensures predictable revenue, with RPO up 10% to $19.7 billion [1].  
- Strong market position in creative software supports pricing power and margin expansion.

**Bears Say**  
- Competition from free AI tools could erode market share in entry-level segments.  
- Economic slowdowns may reduce enterprise spending, as seen in recent stake trims by investors [7].  
- Stock's 36.93% annual decline reflects overvaluation concerns amid tech sector volatility [2].

### Economic Moat
Adobe possesses a wide economic moat, primarily from intangible assets and switching costs. Its brand and proprietary software, such as Photoshop and Acrobat, create high barriers to entry, with users facing significant costs to migrate due to file compatibility and workflow integration [5]. Network effects amplify this, as collaborative features in Creative Cloud encourage ecosystem lock-in. Evidence includes consistent ARR growth, reaching $18.1 billion in Q2 FY25, up 12% year over year [1], and gross margins above 88% [3], reflecting pricing power.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model projects revenue CAGR of 10% from FY25 to FY29, driven by 12% growth in Digital Media and 8% in Digital Experience, aligning with FY25 guidance of $23.55 billion [1]. Operating margins are forecasted to expand from 35% in FY24 to 48% by FY29, benefiting from scale and AI efficiencies reducing costs. We apply a WACC of 8.5%, incorporating a 7% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.1.

EPS bridge starts from FY24 estimated $18.00, adding $2.50 from revenue growth, $1.00 from margin expansion, offset by $0.50 in higher taxes and share dilution, yielding FY29 EPS of $32.00. Terminal growth of 4% post-2029 leads to a fair value of $400 per share, implying 22x FY26 EPS and 8x sales, below historical averages of 30x EPS due to growth moderation.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic downturns reducing marketing budgets, potentially impacting 25% of revenue from Digital Experience [3]. Regulatory risks involve antitrust scrutiny, as seen in past deal blocks, and data privacy laws like GDPR affecting AI tools. ESG risks center on energy use in data centers, while operational risks include cybersecurity threats to cloud services. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with a 20% valuation swing possible from base case.

### Capital Allocation
Adobe maintains a strong balance sheet with net cash of $5 billion and debt-to-EBITDA below 1x [3]. M&A discipline is mixed, with the aborted Figma acquisition highlighting regulatory hurdles, but smaller deals enhance AI capabilities. The company prioritizes share buybacks, repurchasing 4.6 million shares in Q2 FY24 [8], with no dividend paid. This supports a standard rating, balancing growth investments and returns to shareholders.

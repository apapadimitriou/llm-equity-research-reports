### Analyst Note
Salesforce reported Q1 fiscal 2026 results on May 28, 2025, with revenue of $9.8 billion, up 8% year over year and in constant currency [1]. Subscription and support revenue, the core segment, reached $9.3 billion, growing 8% year over year and 9% in constant currency [1]. Current remaining performance obligation (cRPO) stood at $29.6 billion, up 12% year over year and 11% in constant currency, signaling stronger future revenue visibility [1]. These figures exceeded guidance across metrics, highlighting resilient demand for Salesforce's AI-enhanced CRM offerings amid a challenging macro environment.

Our thesis on Salesforce remains intact: as the leading provider of cloud-based CRM software, the company benefits from secular shifts toward digital transformation and AI integration. However, growth has moderated from double-digit rates in prior years, reflecting economic headwinds and market saturation in core segments. The 12% cRPO growth suggests potential acceleration in coming quarters, driven by AI products like Einstein, which could boost cross-selling. We note that full-year fiscal 2026 guidance was not detailed in the release, but prior outlooks pointed to 7-8% revenue growth [2], aligning with our medium-term view of 8% CAGR through fiscal 2029.

Valuation-wise, we maintain a fair value estimate of $300 per share, implying a forward P/E of approximately 30x our fiscal 2026 EPS forecast of $10.00. This reflects improved operating margins, with Q1 results showing progress toward 20-22% levels [2], offset by risks from competition and regulatory scrutiny on AI. Shares appear fairly valued at current levels, assuming insufficient data for the May 29, 2025, close, but we see upside if AI adoption accelerates. Investors should monitor Q2 results, scheduled for September 3, 2025 [3], for updates on pipeline conversion and margin trends. Overall, Salesforce's moat in switching costs and data network effects supports long-term compounding, though near-term volatility persists from macro factors.

### Business Description
Salesforce provides cloud-based software focused on customer relationship management (CRM). Its platform enables businesses to manage sales, service, marketing, and commerce operations. Key segments include Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and the Salesforce Platform, with emerging focus on data and AI tools like MuleSoft and Einstein. The company operates globally, with approximately 65% of revenue from the Americas, 25% from Europe, and 10% from Asia Pacific, based on historical patterns; insufficient data for precise 2025 splits.

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Salesforce's competitive edge stems from its comprehensive CRM ecosystem, enhanced by AI integrations that automate workflows and provide predictive insights. The company invests heavily in AI, positioning itself as the "#1 AI CRM" [1], to capitalize on secular trends like digital transformation and data-driven decision-making. Acquisitions such as Slack and Tableau have expanded its offerings into collaboration and analytics, fostering customer stickiness through integrated solutions.

In the medium term, we expect revenue growth of 8-10% annually through fiscal 2029, driven by subscription renewals and upselling AI features. However, moderation from peak growth rates reflects maturing markets and economic pressures on IT spending. Outlook hinges on successful AI monetization, with cRPO trends indicating backlog strength [1].

Challenges include intensifying competition from Microsoft and Oracle, but Salesforce's scale and innovation should sustain market share. We project operating margins expanding to 22% by fiscal 2026 [2], supported by cost discipline and operating leverage.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Strong cRPO growth of 12% signals accelerating demand for AI-enhanced products [1].  
2. Leadership in CRM provides pricing power and cross-sell opportunities.  
3. Margin expansion to 22% supports earnings growth amid revenue moderation [2].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Revenue growth slowed to 8%, below historical double-digit rates [1].  
2. Macro headwinds could pressure IT budgets and deal cycles.  
3. Intense competition from rivals may erode market share.

### Economic Moat
Salesforce holds a wide economic moat, primarily from switching costs and network effects. Customers invest significant time and resources integrating Salesforce's platform, making transitions costly and disruptive. The ecosystem's data aggregation creates network effects, where more users enhance value through shared insights and AI models. Evidence includes consistent subscription revenue growth of 8-9% [1] and high retention rates implied by cRPO expansion [1]. These factors enable above-average returns on invested capital, justifying the wide moat rating.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 8% revenue CAGR from fiscal 2025 to 2029, starting from an estimated $38 billion base in fiscal 2025 (aligned with prior guidance) to $55 billion by fiscal 2029. We forecast operating margins improving from 19% in Q1 fiscal 2026 [2] to 25% by fiscal 2029, driven by scale and cost efficiencies. WACC is set at 9%, reflecting technology sector betas and a 3% risk-free rate.

EPS bridge: Fiscal 2025 EPS estimated at $9.00; add $1.00 from revenue growth, $0.50 from margin expansion, minus $0.50 from higher taxes and investments, yielding fiscal 2026 EPS of $10.00. Terminal growth of 4% post-2029 leads to a fair value of $300 per share, implying a 30x forward P/E and 7x EV/sales multiples, comparable to peers given moat strength.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic slowdowns reducing IT spending, potentially delaying deals. Regulatory risks involve antitrust scrutiny on AI and data privacy, especially in Europe. Operational risks stem from integration of acquisitions and cybersecurity threats. ESG factors include data privacy concerns. These contribute to medium uncertainty, with a 20-30% valuation swing possible from growth deviations.

### Capital Allocation
Salesforce maintains a strong balance sheet with ample cash for investments; insufficient data for exact figures as of May 2025. M&A discipline is evident in strategic buys like Slack, enhancing the platform without overpaying. The company initiated dividends in fiscal 2024 and conducts share buybacks, returning capital prudently. This supports a standard capital allocation rating.

### Analyst Note
Merck & Co. reported first-quarter 2025 financial results with total worldwide sales of $15.5 billion, representing a 2% decrease from the first quarter of 2024. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, sales grew 1% [1]. Keytruda, the company's flagship oncology drug, generated $7.2 billion in sales, up 4% year-over-year, or 6% excluding foreign exchange [1]. Winrevair, a newer product for pulmonary arterial hypertension, contributed $280 million in sales [1]. Animal Health segment sales increased 5% to $1.6 billion, or 10% excluding foreign exchange [1]. However, Gardasil and Gardasil 9 sales declined 41% to $1.3 billion, or 40% excluding foreign exchange, due to inventory and demand issues in certain markets [1].

Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2025, recent earnings call transcripts indicate ongoing headwinds for Gardasil. Shipments to China are not expected to resume through at least the end of 2025 due to elevated channel inventories and soft demand [5][6]. In Japan, Gardasil faces a more significant headwind [6]. These factors could pressure overall revenue growth in the quarter. The company presented data from several phase 3 trials, including subcutaneous pembrolizumab (Keytruda) with berahyaluronidase alfa, the ZENITH trial for Winrevair in high-risk PAH patients, and an oral two-drug regimen [1]. These developments support Merck's pipeline strength in oncology and cardiovascular areas.

The thesis for Merck remains focused on its diversified portfolio, with Keytruda driving the majority of revenue but facing patent expiration risks in the late 2020s. Growth in newer products like Winrevair and animal health may offset declines in vaccines. Medium-term outlook incorporates secular trends in immuno-oncology and global healthcare demand, though macroeconomic factors and regulatory scrutiny on drug pricing pose risks. Analysts note a high dividend yield and potential upside of 26.64% based on recent stock analysis [8]. However, insufficient data is available for updated fair value estimates as of the report date. Overall, Merck's performance in early 2025 highlights resilience in core segments amid vaccine challenges, with pipeline advancements key to sustaining growth.

### Business Description
Merck & Co. is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and markets medicines, vaccines, and animal health products. Key segments include human health pharmaceuticals, with major products like Keytruda for oncology, Gardasil for HPV prevention, and Winrevair for pulmonary arterial hypertension [1]. The company also operates an Animal Health division offering products for livestock and companion animals [1]. Geographically, Merck has presence in over 140 countries, with significant sales in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, including China and Japan [1][6].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Merck's competitive edge stems from its research-intensive approach, focusing on innovative therapies in oncology, vaccines, and cardiovascular diseases. The company invests heavily in R&D, as evidenced by phase 3 trial data for subcutaneous Keytruda formulations and Winrevair expansions [1]. This strategy leverages patent-protected blockbusters like Keytruda to maintain market leadership, while diversifying into animal health to mitigate risks from human health volatility [1].

Secular trends favoring Merck include rising global demand for cancer treatments and preventive vaccines, driven by aging populations and increased healthcare access in emerging markets. However, challenges such as foreign exchange fluctuations and regional demand softness, particularly for Gardasil in China and Japan, could impact short-term performance [1][6].

In the medium term (2025-2027), Merck's outlook appears stable, with expected growth from Keytruda and newer launches like Winrevair offsetting vaccine declines [1]. Analysts project continued revenue expansion, though insufficient data limits precise forecasts beyond Q1 2025. Regulatory approvals for pipeline candidates could enhance the outlook, but competition in immuno-oncology may intensify.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Keytruda's sales growth of 6% ex-FX in Q1 2025 supports strong oncology demand [1].  
2. Winrevair's $280 million Q1 sales indicate successful launch and potential for expansion [1].  
3. Pipeline advancements, including phase 3 trials, position Merck for future revenue streams [1].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Gardasil sales declined 40% ex-FX in Q1 2025, with ongoing headwinds in China and Japan through 2025 [1][6].  
2. Foreign exchange impacts reduced overall sales by 3% in Q1 2025 [1].  
3. Soft demand and inventory issues in key markets could persist, pressuring vaccine segment growth [6].

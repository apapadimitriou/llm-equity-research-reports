### Reasoning and Analysis
As an equity research analyst, I based this forecast for BlackRock's Q1 2025 on publicly available data from company reports and news, including the full-year 2024 financial results which showed revenue of approximately $20.4 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year increase driven by higher assets under management (AUM) reaching $11.6 trillion and strong net inflows of $641 billion. BlackRock's revenue is primarily from investment advisory fees tied to AUM levels, which have benefited from market appreciation and organic growth.

For Q1 2025, I project revenue growth of about 10% year-over-year from an estimated Q1 2024 baseline (derived from dividing FY 2024 revenue evenly but adjusted for seasonal patterns in asset management, where Q1 often sees moderate inflows post-year-end). This leads to a revenue forecast of $5.2 billion, assuming continued AUM expansion from market trends and acquisitions like GIP mentioned in reports.

EBITDA is forecasted at $2.2 billion, reflecting historical margins around 40-45% (observed in 2024 reports with higher performance fees and technology services), applied to the projected revenue with slight improvements from operational efficiencies.

Operating Income is estimated at $2.0 billion, slightly below EBITDA to account for depreciation and amortization, consistent with patterns in BlackRock's 10-Q filings.

Net Income of $1.6 billion incorporates tax rates around 20-25% (based on historical effective rates from annual reports) and minimal non-operating items.

Free Cash Flow at $1.4 billion assumes strong cash generation from operations, deducting typical capex (low for an asset manager, around 2-3% of revenue per SEC filings), and reflects seasonal working capital changes.

EPS of $10.80 is calculated using an estimated diluted share count of approximately 148 million (inferred from 2024 EPS of $42.01 implying a similar base), divided into the net income projection, with adjustments for any buybacks noted in company updates.

These projections assume stable market conditions, no major economic disruptions, and continued growth in AUM as per trends in BlackRock's quarterly results and press releases up to early 2025. All figures are original estimates derived from aggregating and extrapolating public data without referencing external analyst reports.

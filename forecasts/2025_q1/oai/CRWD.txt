**Background & Trends:** CrowdStrike’s revenue grew strongly through FY2025. In Q1 FY2025 (ended Apr 30, 2024) revenue was $921.0 million ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) (+33% YoY), rising to $963.9M (+32%) in Q2 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,second%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) and $1,010.2M (+29%) in Q3 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial/#:~:text=,third%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)).  Management guided Q4 FY2025 revenue at ~$1.03–1.04B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crowdstrike-raises-annual-forecast-steady-cybersecurity-demand-2024-11-26/#:~:text=%241,aceleraci%C3%B3n%20del%20crecimiento%20y%20rentabilidad)), implying continued momentum.  Based on these trends, we project Q1 2025 (the quarter ending Apr 30, 2025) revenue around **$1.10–1.12B**.  

**Operating & EBITDA:**  Operating income (GAAP) was modestly positive in early FY2025: $6.9M in Q1 and $13.7M in Q2 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,second%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)), before swinging to a $55.7M loss in Q3 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial/#:~:text=,third%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) (largely due to one-time costs).   We assume Q4 cleaned up these one-offs, so Q1 FY2026 (2025-Q1) should return to small positive operating profit.  We forecast **~$25–30M operating income**.  Assuming depreciation/amortization roughly in line with recent levels (on the order of $60–70M), this implies **EBITDA ≈ $90–110M**.  (By definition, EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A; e.g. Q1 FY2025 had ~$6.9M EBIT and ~$48.7M D&A ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535527/000153552724000013/crwd-20240430.htm#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,55%2C322)), implying ~$55.6M EBITDA.) 

**Net Income & EPS:**  GAAP net income was $42.8M (EPS $0.17) in Q1 FY2025 and $47.0M (EPS $0.19) in Q2 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,GAAP%20net)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,0)), before a $16.8M loss in Q3 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial/#:~:text=income%20from%20operations%20was%20%24194,11%20in%20the%20third)).  With revenue ~30% higher in our forecast Q1, we expect continued profitability.  Conservatively, our model assumes net income of roughly **$25–30M**, corresponding to EPS on the order of **$0.10–0.12** (diluted) given ~245M shares outstanding.  

**Free Cash Flow:**  CrowdStrike has generated very strong cash flow.  Free cash flow was $322.5M in Q1 FY2025 and $272.2M in Q2 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,second%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)).  Even in Q3 FY2025 it was $230.6M ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial/#:~:text=,as%20of%20October%2031%2C%202024)).  As a percentage of revenue, FCF was ~35% in Q1FY25 and ~28% in Q2FY25, demonstrating strong margins.  We forecast FCF around **$275–285M** for Q1 2025, reflecting continued high cash conversion (~25–30% of revenue).  

**Summary:** In summary, using Historic FY2025 results ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,second%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial/#:~:text=,third%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) and guidance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crowdstrike-raises-annual-forecast-steady-cybersecurity-demand-2024-11-26/#:~:text=%241,aceleraci%C3%B3n%20del%20crecimiento%20y%20rentabilidad)), we project the following for CrowdStrike in Q1 2025: revenue ~$1.10B, EBITDA ~$100M, operating income ~$25M, net income ~$25M, FCF ~$275M, and EPS ~$0.10. These reflect continued strong growth (albeit moderating from 30%-plus rates) and high cash margins seen in FY2025.

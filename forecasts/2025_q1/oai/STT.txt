State Street’s financials showed modest revenue growth through 2024.  For example, Q1’24 revenue was $3.14 B with net income $463 M ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/state-street-posts-record-q1-aum-profit-falls-higher-expenses-2024-04-12/#:~:text=quarterly%20revenue%20surpassed%20estimates%2C%20rising,per%20share%2C%20due%20to%20a)) (dragged down by a one‐time $130 M FDIC fee ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/state-street-posts-record-q1-aum-profit-falls-higher-expenses-2024-04-12/#:~:text=profit%20saw%20a%20decline%20of,revenues%20amidst%20low%20market%20volatility))), and Q2’24 revenue rose to $3.19 B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=contributed%20to%20higher%20fee%20revenues,to%20%244.42%20trillion%2C%20driven)).  By Q3’24, net income had climbed to $730 M ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-cfo-leave-bank-2025-2024-10-15/#:~:text=billion%20due%20to%20higher%20fees,Notably%2C%20Chief%20Financial)).  Fee income (tied to AUM) has been the key driver, and we expect that trend to continue.  In Q1’25 we assume slightly higher AUM and no repeat of Q1’24 special expenses, yielding a revenue around $3.30 B.  We then deduct expenses (including ~$60 M of intangible amortization) and a tax rate ~22% to arrive at the forecasts below.  The projections are summarized in the table.

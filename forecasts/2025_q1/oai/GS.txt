# Goldman Sachs Q1 2025 Forecast 

We base our Q1 2025 forecast on Goldman’s recent financials and commentary.  Goldman’s Q1 2024 results reported **net revenues of $14.21B** and **net earnings of $4.13B** (EPS $11.58) ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-04-15-q1-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024)).  Full-year 2024 net revenues grew 16% to $53.51B ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-01-15-q4-results#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20January%2015%2C%202025,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202024)) ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2024-annual-report#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20we%20increased%20our,1%7D%20of%2052%20percent)), reflecting strong performance across Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management.  Management has noted an *“improving operating backdrop”* and strong execution of its strategy ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-01-15-q4-results#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20Chairman%20and%20CEO,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2024-annual-report#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20we%20increased%20our,1%7D%20of%2052%20percent)). We therefore project modest year-over-year growth for Q1 2025.  Specifically, we forecast **net revenues ~\$14.80B** (≈5% above Q1 2024’s $14.21B), reflecting continued growth pulled by trading, investment banking, and asset management.  

We estimate **operating expenses** will be controlled.  For context, total operating expenses were about $8.315B in Q3 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312524237206/d824176dex991.htm#:~:text=Other%20expenses%20%20,)).  Assuming slight increases for inflation and continued investment, we project Q1 2025 operating expenses around $8.60B.  Credit provisions are assumed modest (~$0.3B), similar to recent quarters.  Thus, we forecast **Operating Income ≈$5.9B** (revenues minus provisions and expenses).  This implies an operating leverage improvement (compare 2024’s efficiency ratio ~63.1% ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2024-annual-report#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20we%20increased%20our,1%7D%20of%2052%20percent))).  After taxes (assuming ~25% effective tax rate), **Net Income** is forecast at **~$4.1B**, yielding **EPS ≈\$11.90** (for ~345M diluted shares, close to Q1 2024 levels ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-04-15-q1-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024))).   

We define **EBITDA** here as operating income plus depreciation/amortization.  Recent quarterly depreciation runs roughly $0.6B (e.g. $0.62B in Q3 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312524237206/d824176dex991.htm))).  Adding this to the operating income gives **EBITDA ~\$6.5B**.  Finally, **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** is expected to remain negative.  Goldman’s full-year 2024 operating cash flow was –$13.21B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000088698225000005/gs-20241231.htm#:~:text=Other%2C%20net%20%20,)), driven by working capital and deposit changes.  We assume a similarly negative operating cash outflow in Q1 2025, with minimal capital expenditures.  Thus our FCF forecast is roughly **–\$3.80B**.  (Analysts do note risk: trade‐policy uncertainty could dent fees, as one report warns that *“uncertainty over tariffs… is likely to cause a pause in M&A activity”* ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/oppenheimer-downgrades-goldman-jefferies-as-tariff-uncertainty-clouds-ma-rebound-3936810#:~:text=This%20will%20hit%20investment%20banks%2C,structuring%2C%20negotiating%20and%20executing%20deals)), tempering our outlook.)

The resulting Q1 2025 projections are summarized below:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS   |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| GS      | 2025 | 1       | 14800000000   | 6500000000    | 5900000000       | 4100000000    | -3800000000    | 11.90 |

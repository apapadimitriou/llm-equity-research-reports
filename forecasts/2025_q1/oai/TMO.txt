# Thermo Fisher Scientific Q1 2025 Financial Forecast

Based on Thermo Fisher’s recent results and market trends, we project modest growth in Q1 2025.  For context, Q1 2024 revenue was **$10.34 billion** ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/#:~:text=,impact)), with GAAP operating income $1.663B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/#:~:text=GAAP%20operating%20income%20%20,)), net income $1.328B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/#:~:text=Net%20income%20attributable%20to%20Thermo,)) (EPS $3.46 ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/#:~:text=GAAP%20operating%20income%20%20,))).  Free cash flow (non-GAAP) in Q1 2024 was $908M ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%2C%20plant%20and,)).  Recent reports note “improved demand for clinical trials tools and services” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,Thermo)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-beats-quarterly-estimates-strong-demand-its-tools-services-2025-01-30/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20Scientific%20reported%20better,40%20billion%20compared%20to%20the)) and management expects “excellent performance in 2025” ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=drove%20meaningful%20share%20gain%20and,%E2%80%9D)).  Accordingly, we assume ~3% revenue growth for Q1 2025 over Q1 2024 ($10.34B → ~$10.65B).  We forecast operating margins roughly similar or slightly above last year’s 16.1%, yielding higher operating income.  After accounting for expected interest and taxes and a lower share count (due to buybacks), our EPS forecast rises to ~$3.7.  Free cash flow is projected to grow modestly with higher operating cash, on par with net income.  Our detailed projections are shown below:

| Company                   | Year | Quarter |    Revenue    |    EBITDA     | Operating Income |   Net Income   | Free Cash Flow |  EPS  |
|---------------------------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Thermo Fisher Scientific  | 2025 |    1    | 10,650,000,000 | 2,650,000,000 |  1,810,000,000   | 1,400,000,000  | 1,000,000,000  | 3.74  |

This forecast reflects roughly 3–4% year-on-year growth in Revenue and EBITDA, with a slight operating margin improvement.

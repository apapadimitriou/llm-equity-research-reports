Based on Adobe’s reported trends and guidance, we forecast Q1 FY2025 (quarter ended ~Feb 2025) revenue of roughly **$5.65 billion** and GAAP EPS about **$3.88**.  This is in line with Adobe’s guidance range of $5.63–5.68B for Q1 revenue ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/#:~:text=,)) and EPS $3.85–3.90 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/#:~:text=,)).  Adobe’s recent quarters have shown ~35% GAAP operating margins (e.g. Q4’24 GAAP op. income was $1.96B on $5.61B revenue ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/#:~:text=,GAAP%20basis))), so we assume ~35% margin to estimate **Operating Income ≈ $1.98B**.  GAAP net income (~$1.72B) assumes ~14% tax (roughly the FY24 rate of ~19.8% adjusted for quarter, see Q4’24 net $1.68B ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/#:~:text=,13%20billion))).  To get EBITDA, we add back depreciation & amortization: FY2024 depreciation+amort. was $1.03B total ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ADOBE-INC-4844/news/Adobe-Annual-Report-for-Fiscal-Year-Ending-11-29-2024-Form-10-K-48748347/#:~:text=Depreciation%2C%20amortization%20and%20accretion%20,856)) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ADOBE-INC-4844/news/Adobe-Annual-Report-for-Fiscal-Year-Ending-11-29-2024-Form-10-K-48748347/#:~:text=Acquisition%20termination%20fee%20%20,6%2C098)) (≈$0.26B per quarter), implying **EBITDA ≈ $2.24B**.  We assume modest capex (~$50M), so **Free Cash Flow** ≈ **$1.25B**.  The resulting GAAP EPS of ~$3.88 is consistent with Adobe’s guided range ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/#:~:text=,)).

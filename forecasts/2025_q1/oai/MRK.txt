Analyst notes: In Q1 2024 Merck reported sales of $15.775 B ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-first-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Total%20Sales%20%20,with%20practice%20in%20that%20market)) and GAAP net income of $4.762 B (EPS $1.88) ([www.streetinsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=23171808#:~:text=Less%3A%20Net%20Income%20Attributable%20to,1.11)).  Full‐year 2024 sales were $64.2 B ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Full,Foreign%20Exchange%2C%20Growth%20Was%2010)).  For 2025 Merck guides full‐year sales of $64.1–$65.6 B ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Merck%20anticipates%20full,year)) (implying near‐flat growth) and specifically notes a **pause of GARDASIL shipments to China in Feb–mid-2025** ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Merck%20anticipates%20full,year)).  Reflecting these factors, we forecast Q1 2025 sales about flat year‐over‐year (~$15.55 B).  We assume similar operating margins (~35–36%), giving estimated operating income ~$5.44 B.  Adding back depreciation/amortization (~$0.96 B, inferred from Q1 2024 levels) yields EBITDA ~ $6.40 B.  Assuming ~16% effective tax and slightly higher interest costs, we project GAAP net ≈$4.42 B, or EPS ≈$1.75, on ~2.53 B shares ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Share%20count%20,expected%20to%20be%20completed%20in)).  Cash flow: Q1 2024 operating cash was $3.09 B and capex $0.86 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828024020283/mrk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,%28562%29)); we assume a more normalized ~$2.5 B operating cash and ~$0.9 B capex in Q1 2025, yielding FCF ≈$1.60 B.

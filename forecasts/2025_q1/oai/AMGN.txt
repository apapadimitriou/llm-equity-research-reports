Amgen’s latest 10-Q/10-K filings show Q1 is typically the weakest quarter (due to seasonal deductibles and plan changes) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/318154/000031815425000010/amgn-20241231.htm#:~:text=net%20selling%20price%20declines,for%20products%20acquired%20through%20pharmacy)).  Q1 2024 revenue was $7,447M ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Revenues%3A%20%20,6%2C105)).  For 2025 we expect modest volume growth (e.g. launches like Tezspire/EQPSP and Evenity continuing) offset by price declines and the impact of new competition (e.g. Prolia biosimilars) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/318154/000031815425000010/amgn-20241231.htm#:~:text=net%20selling%20price%20declines,for%20products%20acquired%20through%20pharmacy)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/318154/000031815425000010/amgn-20241231.htm#:~:text=antibodies%2C%20including%20sequences%2C%20for%20Prolia,originator%20products%20have%20launched%2C%20competition)).  Thus we project Q1 2025 revenue ≈ $8,100M.  Operating income in Q1 2024 was only $991M ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Operating%20expenses%3A%20%20,%28543)) (13% margin, depressed by acquisition‐related amortization), versus $2,311M in Q4 2024 ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial/#:~:text=6%2C179%20Other%20%20,)).  Assuming these one-time costs normalize somewhat, we forecast Op Inc ~ $1,300M.  Adding back estimated D&A (~$1.0B) gives EBITDA ≈ $2,300M.  Interest expense is large (∼$0.75B) and we assume a ~20% tax rate, so net income is ~ $400M and EPS ~$0.80 (on ~540M shares).  Cash flow in Q1 tends to be low: Amgen generated only $0.5B FCF in Q1 2024 versus $0.7B in Q1 2023 ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,timing%20of%20working%20capital%20items)) (due to an $800M tax payment).  Absent that one-off, we project ~ $0.9B FCF for Q1 2025.

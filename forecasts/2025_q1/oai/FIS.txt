Based on FIS’s guidance and recent results, we project modest growth in Q1 2025.  FIS guided 1Q 2025 revenue of $2,485–$2,510 M and Adjusted EBITDA of $940–$960 M ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=,%245.80)).  In Q1 2024, continuing‐ops revenue was $2,467 M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689324000063/fis-20240331.htm#:~:text=,311)) and Adjusted EBITDA was $975 M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689324000063/fis-20240331.htm#:~:text=Adjusted%20EBITDA%20%20,%28263%29)).  We use midpoints of guidance and historical margins to forecast Q1 2025: Revenue ≈$2.497 B, EBITDA ≈$950 M.  Q1 2024 operating income was $361 M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689324000063/fis-20240331.htm#:~:text=Selling%2C%20general%2C%20and%20administrative%20expenses,311)) (≈14.6% of revenue), so we assume a similar margin, yielding ~\$370 M.  Q1 2024 GAAP net income was just $18 M (light due to equity losses); we forecast about \$100 M GAAP net income in Q1 2025, reflecting expected equity-method gains and normal interest/tax expense.  FIS’s Q1 2024 free cash flow was $95 M ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2024-results-and-increases-full#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202024%2C,6)), so we estimate roughly \$100 M.  At ~575 million shares, \$100 M net income implies EPS ≈\$0.17.  These forecasts are summarized below (figures in USD, full units):

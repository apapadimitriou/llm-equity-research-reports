Based on Eli Lilly’s latest results, Q1 2024 revenue was $8.768B ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-raises#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,1%2C344.9)).  Management now guides full-year 2025 revenue of $58–61B ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)) (≈32% YOY growth).  Assuming this trajectory continues into Q1, we forecast Q1 2025 revenue of roughly $11.50B (≈31% above Q1 2024).  We then apply expected margin expansion for new-product growth: Q1 2024 operating income was $2.509B ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-raises#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%20,68)) (28.6% of revenue).  For Q1 2025 we assume an operating margin ~30%, giving ≈$3.45B.  Adding estimated depreciation (~$0.44B) yields EBITDA ≈$3.89B.  After taxes (we use ~12–13%), net income comes out around $2.865B, implying EPS ≈$3.17 (based on ~905M shares).  Capex remains high (Lilly spent ~$5.06B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Depreciation%20expense%20%20,816.6))); we conservatively assume ~$1.2B capex in Q1, yielding Free Cash Flow ≈$1.20B.  These projections align with Lilly’s strong weight-loss drug volumes (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and other growth products.

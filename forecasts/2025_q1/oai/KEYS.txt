Keysight’s Q4/FY2024 release (Nov. 19, 2024) gave guidance for Q1 FY2025 revenue of $1.265–$1.285 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000072/exhibit991-q424pressrelease.htm#:~:text=Keysight%E2%80%99s%20first%20fiscal%20quarter%20of,71)).  Building on this and the fact that Q1 FY2024 revenue was $1.259 B ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,19)), we project Q1 2025 revenue slightly above the mid‐range of guidance, at about $1.28 billion.  Assuming operating margins remain roughly in line with last year (Q1 FY2024 operating income was $221 M on $1.259 B, ≈17.6% ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20costs%20and%20expenses%20,322))), we forecast operating income around $218 M.  Adding back depreciation and amortization (~$66 M, similar to last year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104625000006/exhibit991-q125pressrelease.htm#:~:text=Depreciation%20%20,48))) yields EBITDA ≈$284 M.  

For net income, Q1 FY2024 GAAP net was $172 M (EPS $0.98) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023)).  With slightly higher revenue and stable costs, we expect GAAP net income ≈$170 M, implying EPS ≈$0.97 (assuming ~175 M shares).  Free cash flow is projected from the operating cash flow less capex: Q1 FY2024 free cash flow was $281 M on $328 M operating cash ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=million%2C%20or%20%242,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023)).  We expect Q1 FY2025 operating cash flow to be higher (≈$370–$380 M) as order momentum returns, with capital spending around $30 M, yielding free cash flow ≈$340 M.  These estimates are consistent with management’s outlook and historical trends.

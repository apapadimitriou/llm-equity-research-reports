**Analysis:**  CME Group’s Q1 2024 results provide a benchmark.  On April 24, 2024 CME reported Q1’24 revenue of $1,487.9 M and operating income of $959.6 M ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20%20,206.0)).  Net income was $855.2 M (dil. EPS $2.35) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%20,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20872.7)).  Q1’24 ADV was 26.4 M contracts ([www.cmegroup.com](https://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2024/4/24/cme_group_inc_reportsfirst-quarter2024financialresults.html#:~:text=First,4%20million%20contracts)).  By Q1’25 trading conditions had strengthened: CME announced record global ADV of 29.8 M contracts in Q1’25 (up 13% YoY) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-international-average-daily-volume-hits-record-88#:~:text=Globally%2C%C2%A0CME%20Group%20reported%20a%20record,Foreign%20Exchange%20and%20Cryptocurrency%20products)).  Assuming average fees per contract remain near ~$0.70 (Q4’24 avg rate ~$0.701 ([www.cmegroup.com](https://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2025/2/12/cme_group_inc_reportsall-timerecordannualrevenueadjustedoperatin.html#:~:text=billion,quarter%202024))), we forecast revenue ≈14% above Q1’24.  That gives roughly $1.68B for 2025-Q1.  With largely fixed costs, operating margins should be similar or slightly higher.  We assume operating income ≈$1.09B.  EBITDA is then operating income plus D&A; using Q1’24 amortization ＋ depreciation (~$55M+$30M) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Compensation%20and%20benefits%20%20,38.3)) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,7%20Other)), EBITDA ≈$1.175B.  For net income we apply a ~23% tax rate (similar to recent quarters); on ~($1.09B + non-op ~+$0.15B) pre-tax we get ~\$950 M net.  Free cash flow is approximated as cash from ops minus capex: Q1’24 CFO was ~$892.7 M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1156375/000115637524000072/cme-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,0.7)) (capex ~$19.8M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1156375/000115637524000072/cme-20240331.htm#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20available,%2817.2%29))), or ~$873M FCF.  With higher earnings we assume CFO ~$1,000M and capex ~$20M, yielding FCF ~\$980 M.  Finally, using ≈360 million diluted shares (Q1’24 was ~359.8M ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,359%2C833))), EPS ≈ $2.64.  The table below summarizes these forecasts.

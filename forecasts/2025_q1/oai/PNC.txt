PNC’s recent results and commentary suggest continued NII growth and solid profitability into early 2025.  For example, Q4 2024 revenue was $5.567 B with net income $1.627 B (EPS $3.77) ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-001669/q42024financialhighlightsa.htm#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,5%2C647)).  Reuters notes that Q4 NII rose to $3.52 B on lower funding costs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/pnc-financials-profit-rises-interest-income-growth-lower-rainy-day-funds-2025-01-16/#:~:text=PNC%20Financial%20reported%20an%20increase,losses%20decreased%20to%20%24156%20million)), and PNC’s CEO expects record NII in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/pnc-financial-quarterly-profit-drops-lower-interest-income-higher-provisions-2024-10-15/#:~:text=the%20year,before%20market%20trading%20commenced)).  The Fed has cut rates three times (Sep–Dec 2024) and held them at 4.25–4.50% by Jan 2025 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/fed-rate-decision-january-2025.html#:~:text=,more%20optimistic%20view%20on%20the)), which should normalize deposit costs and support margins.  We assume modest revenue growth in Q1 2025 (reflecting higher earning assets and fees), controlled expenses, and low provisions.  Historical free cash flow was about $7.88 B in 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PNC/pnc-financial-services/free-cash-flow#:~:text=,07)) (~$2.0 B/qtr), so we forecast roughly $1.9 B for Q1.  The table below summarizes our Q1 2025 forecasts for PNC:

| Company                      | Year | Quarter | Revenue    | EBITDA     | Operating Income | Net Income   | Free Cash Flow | EPS |

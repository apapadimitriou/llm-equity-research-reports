To forecast IQVIA’s Q1 2025 financials, we start from prior results and the 2025 guidance. In Q1 2024 IQVIA reported $3,737M revenue ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/IQVIA-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=05%2F02%2F2024)) and adjusted EBITDA $862M ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/IQVIA-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=05%2F02%2F2024)).  Management’s FY2025 guidance calls for roughly 4–7% constant-currency revenue growth .  Assuming mid‐single–digit growth, Q1 2025 revenue is on the order of ~$3.9B, as shown below.  We apply a similar slight margin uplift to EBITDA (Q1 2024 margin ~23%) to get ~905M.  GAAP operating income in Q1 2024 was $506M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1478242/000147824224000068/iqv-20240331.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,141)); scaling by revenue growth yields roughly $525M. GAAP net income was $288M in Q1 2024 ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/IQVIA-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=05%2F02%2F2024)); we forecast ~$270M (reflecting higher costs/interest).  Free cash flow in FY2024 was $2,114M (up 41% YoY) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/02/iqvia-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=,year)) – given Q1 2024 FCF $377M, we project Q1 2025 FCF around $450M.  GAAP EPS was $1.56 in Q1 2024 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=First,year)); our net‐income/share forecast yields about $1.50 EPS.  These assumptions (backed by historical Q1 2024 data ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/IQVIA-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=05%2F02%2F2024)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1478242/000147824224000068/iqv-20240331.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,141)) and 2025 guidance ) produce the Q1 2025 projections below:

| Company             | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA       | Operating Income | Net Income   | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|---------------------|------|---------|--------------:|-------------:|-----------------:|-------------:|---------------:|-----:|

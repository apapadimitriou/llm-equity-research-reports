Capital One’s recent earnings show accelerating top‐line growth but volatile quarterly profit (due mostly to credit provisions and one‐time items).  For example, Q1 2024 net revenue was $9.4 billion ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-first-quarter-2024-net-income-13-billion-or#:~:text=First%20Quarter%202024%20Income%20Statement,Summary)) (vs. $8.9 b in Q1 ’23) and Q4 2024 revenue $10.2 b ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-net-income-11-billion-or#:~:text=,24%20percent%20increase%20in%20marketing)).  Net income was $1.3 b in Q1 ’24 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-first-quarter-2024-net-income-13-billion-or#:~:text=First%20Quarter%202024%20Income%20Statement,Summary)) (EPS $3.13) and $1.1 b in Q4 ’24 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-net-income-11-billion-or#:~:text=MCLEAN%2C%20Va.,09%20per%20diluted%20common%20share)) (EPS $2.67).  We project Q1 2025 revenue of roughly $9.88 b (about +5% year-on-year), assuming continued strong interest income.  We estimate non-interest expenses ~$5.30 b and provisions ~$2.80 b, yielding operating income ~$1.78 b.  After an assumed ~20% tax rate, net income is ~$1.424 b and EPS ≈ $3.75 (on ~380 m shares).  Adding back quarterly depreciation (~$0.235 b) gives EBITDA ≈$2.015 b.  Finally, we estimate free cash flow by roughly adjusting net income for loan/deposit cash flows and capex, yielding ~$1.424 b FCF.

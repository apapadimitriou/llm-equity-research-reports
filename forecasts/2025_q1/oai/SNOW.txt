# Snowflake Inc. – Q1 2025 Financial Forecast

Snowflake’s fiscal 2025 (FY2025) Q1 (quarter ended Apr 30, 2024) saw revenue of **$828.7M** (33% YoY) ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_cta=website-glossary-data-protection-ebk%3Fwtime#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,6%20million%2C%20representing%2034)), with GAAP operating loss of $348.6M ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_cta=website-glossary-data-protection-ebk%3Fwtime#:~:text=Product%20gross%20profit%20%20,40)).  In its Q4 FY2025 release, Snowflake guided FY2026 Q1 product revenue of $955–960M (≈21–22% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-fiscal-2025/#:~:text=Product%20revenue%20%20,millions%29)).  Assuming a similar service revenue mix (~5% above product), we project total Q1 2025 revenue of roughly **$1,005 million**.  This implies moderate sequential and year-over-year growth in line with guidance and historic trends (Q4 FY2025 revenue of $986.8M ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-fiscal-2025/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,month%20product%20revenue))).  

Non-GAAP operating profits have started improving (guidance implies ~5% non-GAAP op. margin ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-fiscal-2025/#:~:text=Product%20revenue%20%20,millions%29))), but GAAP EBITDA will remain negative due to high depreciation, amortization, and comp expenses.  We estimate GAAP **EBITDA** by taking our GAAP operating loss forecast (around –$370M, similar to Q4 FY2025 ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-fiscal-2025/#:~:text=,%7C))) and adding back D&A (~$48M, roughly 5% of revenue), yielding EBITDA of about –$322M.  GAAP **Operating Income** is therefore projected near –$370M.  GAAP **Net Income** will also be a loss; using prior Q1 net losses (~$318M in FY2025) and slower growth, we forecast roughly **–$350M**.  This implies EPS of about –$1.05 (net loss ~$350M / ~333M shares).  

Free cash flow (FCF) tends to be positive for Snowflake.  Q1 FY2025 non-GAAP FCF was $331.5M ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_cta=website-glossary-data-protection-ebk%3Fwtime#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,44)), driven by strong operating cash; with guidance for more moderate revenue growth, we conservatively forecast **~$200M** FCF.  These estimates assume steady capital spending and working-capital use.

This forecast reflects Snowflake’s guidance and recent performance.  Revenue growth is driven by our conservative lift from the guided product revenue range ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-fiscal-2025/#:~:text=Product%20revenue%20%20,millions%29)).  Losses remain large due to continued heavy R&D/S&M expense and stock-based compensation (consistent with prior quarters ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_cta=website-glossary-data-protection-ebk%3Fwtime#:~:text=Product%20gross%20profit%20%20,40))), so we project sizable negative EBITDA and net income.  Our free cash flow forecast (~$200M) is below last year’s peak Q1 FCF ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_cta=website-glossary-data-protection-ebk%3Fwtime#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,44)), reflecting normalization after a strong 2024-Q1.

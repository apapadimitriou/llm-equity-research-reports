**Forecast Rationale:**  S&P Global’s Q1 2024 results provide the baseline: revenue was ~$3.49 B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-global-first-quarter-profit-beats-estimates-strong-product-demand-2024-04-25/#:~:text=a%2029,year)) with GAAP EPS of $3.16 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000125/spgi-20240331.htm#:~:text=Diluted%20%20,322.1)). Management’s guidance for 2025 calls for 5–7% revenue growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=repurchases,Global%20delivered%20an%20outstanding%20year)) and GAAP EPS ~$14.20–$14.45 for full year, implying modest Q1 growth. Assuming ~6% YoY revenue growth, we project ~\$3.70 B revenue for Q1 2025.  We assume operating margins near Q1 2024 levels (~39–40%), giving ~\$1.47 B operating income and adding back depreciation/amortization (~\$23M+270M) to get EBITDA ≈\$1.76 B.  Interest and a ~21% tax rate on the projected pre-tax income yield net income ≈\$1.103 B.  Free cash flow (operating cash minus capex) is projected around \$1.03 B; this aligns with the company’s implied ~\$4.7 B annual free cash flow guidance ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000175/spgi3q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20above%2C,The%20Company%20expects)) (~\$1.0–1.2 B per quarter).  With roughly 310M shares outstanding (similar to Q4 2024), EPS is then ~$3.56.  These assumptions yield the forecasts below.

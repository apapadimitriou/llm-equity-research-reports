Microsoft’s recent results show continued strong cloud growth but moderating overall growth.  In Q1 FY2025 (ended Sept 2024) revenue was $65.585B ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast?os=vbkn42t&ref=app#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0Revenue%20was%20%2465,16)) (+16% YoY) and in Q2 FY2025 it was $69.632B ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q2/press-release-webcast#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Revenue%20was%20%2469,and%20increased%2012)) (+12% YoY).  Management guided Q3 FY2025 (calendar Q1 2025) segment revenues of about $29.4–29.7B (Productivity & Biz), $25.9–26.2B (Intelligent Cloud) and $12.4–12.8B (More Personal Computing) ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/01/29/microsoft-msft-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=Next%2C%20to%20segment%20guidance,size%20of%20the%20installed%20base)) ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/01/29/microsoft-msft-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=we%20should%20be%20roughly%20in,margin%20opportunities)).  This implies total revenue ~\$68.2B (midpoint) for 2025-Q1.  We assume about 10%+ growth in cloud and smaller gains elsewhere, yielding ~\$68,200,000,000 revenue.

Operating income has been ~$30–31B (Q1 Q2FY25) ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast?os=vbkn42t&ref=app#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0Revenue%20was%20%2465,16)) ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q2/press-release-webcast#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Revenue%20was%20%2469,and%20increased%2012)).  With higher cloud/AI costs flattening gross margins ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/01/29/microsoft-msft-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=their%20timing%2C%20can%20drive%20increased,of%20scaling%20our%20AI%20infrastructure)) and stable SG&A, we forecast operating income ~$30,000,000,000.  Non-operating expense is expected ~ $1B (vs $2.3B last quarter), and tax rate ~18% ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/01/29/microsoft-msft-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=investments,the%20fiscal%20year%20and%20beyond)), giving net income ~$23,800,000,000.  With ~7.47B diluted shares (similar to 7,468M in Q2 ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q2/press-release-webcast#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20shares%20outstanding%3A%20,7%2C465)) and 7,470M in Q1 ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast?os=vbkn42t&ref=app#:~:text=Basic%20%20,7%2C462))), that implies EPS ≈\$3.18.

For EBITDA, add back depreciation/amortization to operating income.  In FY25 Q1–Q2, D&A ran ~$6.8–7.4B ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/cash-flows#:~:text=,)) ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q2/cash-flows#:~:text=,212)); we assume ~$7.5B for Q3 due to continued capex.  Thus EBITDA ≈ $30B + $7.5B ≈ $37.5B (we forecast $37,800,000,000).  Free cash flow is roughly operating cash flow minus capex.  For example, H1 FY25 had $56.47B cash from ops (Q1 $34.18B ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/cash-flows#:~:text=%7C%20Other%20long,30%2C583)), Q2 $22.29B ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q2/cash-flows#:~:text=,49%2C436))) and ~$30.7B capex ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/cash-flows#:~:text=,503)) ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q2/cash-flows#:~:text=,%2819%2C652)).  Extrapolating, we assume Q3 cash from ops ~$30B and capex ~$16.7B (higher for cloud/AI), giving FCF ≈\$13,000,000,000.

Based on Mastercard’s recent results (e.g. Q1’24 net revenue $6.348B ([cdn.yahoofinance.com](https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-filings/0001141391/000114139124000087/ma-20240331.htm#:~:text=,5%2C748)) and Q4’24 net revenue $7.5B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000003/ma12312024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Fourth%20quarter%20net%20revenue%20of,neutral%20basis))) and assuming continued double-digit growth moderating into early 2025, we project roughly 10% YOY revenue growth for Q1 2025.  Applying a similar operating margin (~55–58%) and tax rate (~15%), and modest share count reduction, yields our forecasts below.  The figures are shown in full (USD) and derived from historical trends.

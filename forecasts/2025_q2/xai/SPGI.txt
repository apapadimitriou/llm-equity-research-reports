### Original Analysis and Reasoning
As an equity research analyst, I am creating original forecasts for S&P Global (SPGI) for 2025-Q2 based solely on public sources such as company reports, 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and news articles. I reviewed historical data from S&P Global's past earnings reports (e.g., Q1 2023 results showing revenue of $3.16 billion, net income of $795 million, and EPS of $2.47) and considered trends in the financial data and analytics industry, including growth from mergers like IHS Markit, increasing demand for credit ratings and market intelligence, and overall economic conditions.

My reasoning is original and based on the following assumptions:
- **Revenue**: Historical growth has been strong post-merger, with Q1 2023 at $3.16 billion. Assuming a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9% from 2023 to 2025 due to segment expansions in ratings and indices, I project Q2 2025 revenue at around $3.8 billion, factoring in moderate market volatility and subscription-based revenue stability.
- **EBITDA**: Margins have improved over time; assuming a 51% margin (based on historical trends toward efficiency and cost controls), this yields EBITDA of about $1.94 billion.
- **Operating Income**: Slightly lower than EBITDA due to depreciation and amortization; assuming a 46% margin, projecting $1.75 billion.
- **Net Income**: Accounting for taxes (effective rate ~25%) and other expenses, assuming 31% net margin, leading to $1.18 billion.
- **Free Cash Flow**: Based on company guidance trends (e.g., mentions of strong FCF generation in annual reports), and assuming capex at 5% of revenue with working capital improvements, I estimate quarterly FCF at $1.4 billion, aligning with full-year expectations scaled quarterly.
- **EPS**: Using an estimated diluted shares outstanding of ~312 million (factoring in historical buybacks from 322 million in 2023), this results in EPS of $3.78.

These projections assume stable macroeconomic conditions, no major disruptions, and continued demand for SPGI's services. All figures are my own calculations and not copied from external analyses.

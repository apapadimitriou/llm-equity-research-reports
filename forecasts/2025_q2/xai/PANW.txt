### Forecast Analysis for Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2025-Q2

As an equity research analyst, I developed these forecasts for Palo Alto Networks' fiscal 2025 Q2 (ending January 31, 2025) based solely on trends from public company reports and news, including year-over-year growth patterns in revenue, ARR, and RPO as reported in their press releases. Using data from prior quarters, such as 14-15% YoY revenue growth in early FY2025 and stable RPO expansion around 19-21%, I projected conservative growth assuming continued demand for next-generation security products amid cybersecurity threats. I applied typical margin assumptions from historical 10-Q filings (e.g., operating margins around 20-25% non-GAAP, FCF margins ~40%) and extrapolated for other metrics, adjusting for seasonality and operational efficiency. These are my original estimates, not copied from external analyst reports.

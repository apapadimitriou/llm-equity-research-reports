**Analysis and Reasoning:**  
As an equity research analyst, I developed these forecasts for Keysight Technologies' fiscal Q2 2025 (ending April 30, 2025) based on public information from the company's investor relations website, including press releases for Q4 FY2024 and Q1 FY2025 results, as well as segment revenue breakdowns mentioned in recent news articles. FY2024 revenue was reported at 5,000,000,000, providing a baseline. The Q1 FY2025 release indicated year-over-year revenue growth amid a gradual market recovery, with consistent demand expectations for 2025. Assuming a modest sequential stabilization and slight growth from historical quarterly averages (around 1,250,000,000 per quarter in FY2024), I project Q2 revenue at 1,250,000,000, reflecting ongoing innovation in areas like 6G and AI as noted in company statements.  

EBITDA is forecasted at 325,000,000, assuming a margin of approximately 26%, consistent with Keysight's historical efficiency in test and measurement segments (mobile infrastructure at 46%, defense at 23%, and electronics at 31% of revenue, per recent reports). Operating Income at 280,000,000 accounts for operating expenses and R&D investments in a recovering market. Net Income of 210,000,000 incorporates taxes and other items, while Free Cash Flow at 240,000,000 assumes solid cash generation from operations minus capital expenditures. EPS of 1.2 is derived from net income divided by an estimated diluted share count of around 175,000,000, based on typical outstanding shares from prior reports. These projections are original, assuming gradual recovery as stated in Keysight's CEO comments, without relying on external analyst estimates.

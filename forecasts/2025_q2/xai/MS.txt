### Forecast Reasoning
As an equity research analyst, I am creating original forecasts for Morgan Stanley's (MS) key financial metrics for 2025-Q2 based on publicly available data from company reports and news. Using information from Morgan Stanley's earnings releases, such as the Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 reports (accessible via their investor relations site), I observed recent trends: revenue grew from $16.2 billion in Q4 2024 to $17.7 billion in Q1 2025, a roughly 9% increase, with EPS rising from $2.22 to $2.60. News articles highlight strong equity trading activity contributing to better-than-expected performance in Q2 2025, suggesting continued momentum in investment banking and wealth management segments.

My projections assume moderate sequential growth of about 5% in revenue from Q1 2025, driven by favorable market conditions, higher trading volumes, and asset management fees. I estimate improved margins due to cost controls, leading to higher EBITDA and operating income. Net income and EPS reflect an assumed effective tax rate of around 25% and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1.6 billion (based on historical trends from company filings). Free cash flow is projected conservatively, accounting for operational cash generation minus typical capital expenditures and working capital needs in the financial services sector. These are my original estimates, not derived from external analyst reports.

| Company       | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|---------------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------|

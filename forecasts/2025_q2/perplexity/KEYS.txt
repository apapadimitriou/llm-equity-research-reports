Let me analyze the search results to understand what I need to forecast for Keysight Technologies. Looking at the personalization instructions, I need to forecast key financial metrics for 2025-Q2 (second quarter of 2025) including:

1. Revenue
2. EBITDA  
3. Operating Income
4. Net Income
5. Free Cash Flow
6. EPS (Earnings Per Share)

Wait, let me check the current date mentioned in the planning rules: "Sunday, August 10, 2025, 12:45:16 AM UTC". This means we're in August 2025, so Q2 2025 has already passed. Looking at the search results, I can see that Keysight already reported their Q2 2025 results on May 20, 2025.

From the search results, I can see the actual Q2 2025 results:
- Revenue: $1.306 billion (mentioned in multiple sources)
- EPS: $1.70 (non-GAAP)
- Net Income: $257 million or $295 million (different sources mention different figures)
- Free Cash Flow: $457 million
- Orders: $1.316 billion

But the user is asking me to forecast these metrics. Since we're past Q2 2025, they might want me to forecast for a future quarter. Let me re-read the instructions...

The instructions say "Forecast the following metrics for the following period: 2025-Q2". But we're already past that period. This is confusing. Let me assume they want me to create a forecast analysis that would have been relevant before Q2 2025 results were announced, and then I can compare my forecast to the actual results.

Actually, let me re-read more carefully. The personalization says "You are an equity research analyst working at a major investment bank, tasked with creating forecasts for key financial metrics. Forecast the following metrics for the following period: 2025-Q2"

Given that we're in August 2025 and Q2 2025 results are already out, I think the user might want me to either:


1. Forecast Q2 2025 as an analytical exercise (even though results are out)
2. They made an error and want me to forecast a future quarter

I'll develop a retrospective forecast methodology to analyze Q2 2025 performance, comparing projected estimates with actual reported results. This approach will demonstrate my analytical process and provide insights into Keysight's financial performance.

My forecast will involve carefully examining Q1 2025 results, historical trends, and key business segment dynamics to create a precise predictive model for the quarter's financial metrics.

CSG segment shows strong 9% year-over-year growth, indicating robust momentum in communications and semiconductor testing markets. The segment's performance exceeded initial expectations, suggesting underlying technological investment and market demand are more resilient than anticipated.

EISG experienced a surprising 5% year-over-year increase, contrary to the previous quarter's projected decline. This unexpected growth signals potential market stabilization or new strategic initiatives driving revenue in electronic industrial segments.

The company's overall financial performance demonstrates consistent execution, with revenue surpassing guidance and non-GAAP EPS exceeding projected ranges. Free cash flow of $457 million underscores strong operational efficiency and cash generation capabilities.

Operating margin at 25% reflects disciplined cost management and strategic operational improvements. The net income range of $257-295 million indicates potential variability in accounting treatments or one-time adjustments.

Preliminary analysis suggests continued strategic positioning and market adaptability across key business segments.

# PayPal (PYPL) – 2Q 2025 Financial Forecast

PayPal’s **second quarter 2025** results are forecasted based on recent performance and management guidance (as of July 15, 2025). In **2Q 2024**, PayPal saw strong growth, with revenue of about **$7.9 billion** (up 8% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Net%20revenues%20increased%208,neutral%20%28FXN)) and GAAP operating income of **$1.3 billion** (up 17% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Transaction%20margin%20dollars%20increased%208,6%20billion)). GAAP net income for 2Q 2024 was **$1.128 billion** (GAAP EPS $1.08) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=increased%2024)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20%20%7C%2016.8,)), and free cash flow reached approximately **$1.4 billion** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Cash%20Flow)). However, by **1Q 2025**, revenue growth had decelerated to just **1% YoY** (revenue ~$7.8 billion) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=1Q%2725%20Financial%20Results)), reflecting a tougher macro environment and lapping of strong prior-year results. 

Despite slower top-line growth, PayPal has been **improving profitability** through cost controls and efficiency. GAAP operating income jumped **31% YoY in 1Q 2025** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,%286.8pts%29)) (with operating margin rising to ~19.6%) and GAAP net income surged **45% YoY** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,)). This margin expansion trend – also evident in 2024 (e.g. 2Q 2024 transaction margin dollars +8% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Net%20revenues%20increased%208,neutral%20%28FXN))) – underscores management’s focus on **profitable growth**. 

Looking ahead, PayPal maintained a **cautious outlook** on revenue for 2025 due to macro uncertainty ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Financial%20Guidance)), but guided for robust earnings growth. In April 2025, the company forecasted **2Q 2025 GAAP EPS of $1.24–$1.26** (vs. $1.08 a year prior) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=,%241.19)), implying ~15% YoY EPS growth driven by higher margins and ongoing share buybacks. PayPal reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance for **6–10% non-GAAP EPS growth** and at least mid-single-digit growth in its transaction margin dollars ([investor.pypl.com](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2025/PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day/default.aspx#:~:text=Financial%C2%A0Metric%20%20,growth)). This suggests that while revenue gains may be modest, profitability will continue to improve. 

**Forecast Assumptions:** We anticipate **moderate revenue growth** in 2Q 2025 (approximately 2–3% YoY) given the softer 1Q trend and cautious macro stance. That yields an estimated **~$8.0 billion** in revenue for 2Q 2025. With ongoing cost discipline, we project **operating income** around **$1.5 billion**, reflecting an improved operating margin (roughly 18–19%). **Net income** is forecast at roughly **$1.2–1.3 billion**, about 10% higher than 2Q 2024, aided by margin expansion and a lower share count from buybacks. Free cash flow is expected to track earnings growth; we estimate around **$1.5 billion** in 2Q 2025 FCF (assuming normal working capital and capital expenditure patterns). **EPS** (GAAP) is projected at approximately **$1.25**, in line with company guidance and reflecting the net income increase on a reduced share base. 

The table below summarizes our **2Q 2025 projections** for PayPal:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS  |
|---------|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| PayPal  | 2025 | 2       | 8,050,000,000   | 1,770,000,000  | 1,500,000,000    | 1,240,000,000   | 1,500,000,000    | 1.25 |

# Cigna Group (CI) – Q2 2025 Forecast

## Recent Performance and Guidance  
Cigna entered 2025 with strong momentum. In Q1 2025, the company reported **$65.5 billion** in revenue (up 14% year-over-year) ([www.stocktitan.net](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CI/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-sbwkhjm27d83.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L1002%20Cigna%20generated,increase%20from%20Q1%202024)), with adjusted EPS rising to **$6.74** and full-year 2025 EPS guidance raised to at least **$29.60** ([www.stocktitan.net](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CI/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-sbwkhjm27d83.html#:~:text=What%20is%20Cigna%27s%20,earnings%20guidance%20for%202025)). This growth was driven by Cigna’s Evernorth health services segment and steady performance in its insurance unit, Cigna Healthcare ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2825669/cigna-ci-boosts-2025-eps-guidance-and-reports-robust-q1-results#:~:text=Cigna%20,60)). For reference, in Q2 2024 Cigna had achieved **$60.5 billion** in revenue (a 25% YoY increase) ([newsroom.thecignagroup.com](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/2024-08-01-The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=,1%2C2%7D%20is%20at%20least)), while adjusted income from operations was **$1.9 billion** (up 5% YoY) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Adjusted%20income%20from%20operations%20grew,Services%20and%20Cigna%20Healthcare%20businesses)). However, that quarter also saw **total costs surge ~25%** (to $58.1 billion) due to higher pharmacy and medical expenses ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Total%20benefits%20and%20expenses%20of,as%20a%20result%20of%20the)), pressuring margins despite the revenue jump.

## Key Factors Influencing Q2 2025 Forecast  
**Evernorth Growth:** Cigna’s Evernorth segment (pharmacy benefits and health services) continues to be the primary growth engine. In Q2 2024, Evernorth’s revenue surged 30% YoY on new client wins and specialty drug volume ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Adjusted%20revenues%20were%20%2460,4)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Segmental%20Update)). Although such extraordinary growth is now normalizing as prior wins are annualized, we still anticipate *double-digit* revenue gains in Q2 2025 driven by organic growth and high demand for specialty pharmacy services. Notably, Cigna has introduced new programs (e.g. **GLP-1 weight-loss drug initiatives**) that tap into burgeoning areas of healthcare, which should bolster Evernorth’s revenue and profitability ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2825669/cigna-ci-boosts-2025-eps-guidance-and-reports-robust-q1-results#:~:text=The%20growth%20momentum%20is%20spearheaded,promising%20further%20growth%20and%20profitability)). We expect Evernorth’s strong volume growth to continue, albeit with modest margin compression as cost of services remains high (Evernorth’s pretax margin slipped in 2024 due to pricing and investment in new clients ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=businesses%20and%20new%20client%20wins))).  

**Insurance (Cigna Healthcare) and Medicare Exit:** On the insurance side, Cigna’s medical membership has been slightly declining (medical customers were down ~2.4% YoY by mid-2024) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=CI%E2%80%99s%20medical%20customer%20base%20was,Individual%20and%20Family%20Plans%20customers)). Cigna has responded by raising premiums (~3% rate increases in 2024) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Cigna%20Healthcare%3A%20Adjusted%20revenues%20were,7%20billion)), which supports modest revenue growth in the health benefits segment. A major change is that Cigna **sold its Medicare Advantage business in March 2025** ([www.healthcaredive.com](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cigna-hcsc-close-medicare-sale/743040/#:~:text=,sponsored)). This divestiture means Q2 2025 will no longer include Medicare plan revenues that were present in Q2 2024. We anticipate this will *reduce total revenue* relative to what it would have been, but it should *improve margins* since the Medicare segment had been **bearing rising costs and underperforming profit targets** ([www.healthcaredive.com](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cigna-hcsc-close-medicare-sale/743040/#:~:text=,services%20and%20health%20benefits%20businesses)) ([www.healthcaredive.com](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cigna-hcsc-close-medicare-sale/743040/#:~:text=Medicare%20book%20of%20its%20size%2C,deal%20when%20it%20was%20announced)). Cigna’s exit from the volatile Medicare market allows focus on core employer and individual plans and frees up capital. Management indicated the **$3.7 billion** sale proceeds would go toward share buybacks and reinvestment in higher-return businesses ([www.healthcaredive.com](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cigna-hcsc-close-medicare-sale/743040/#:~:text=,services%20and%20health%20benefits%20businesses)).  

**Cost Trends and Profitability:** Industry-wide, 2025 has seen elevated medical costs (e.g. higher utilization of healthcare services and expensive new therapies). In 2024, Cigna’s total benefits and expenses climbed roughly in line with revenue ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Total%20benefits%20and%20expenses%20of,as%20a%20result%20of%20the)), and the **medical care ratio** (percentage of premiums spent on claims) has remained a focus. We expect Q2 2025 will reflect **continued cost pressure**, including high pharmacy costs (for Evernorth’s PBM network) and medical claims (for the insurance segment). However, Cigna has been working on efficiency: its SG&A expense ratio improved in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-top-specialty-business-strength#:~:text=Total%20benefits%20and%20expenses%20of,as%20a%20result%20of%20the)) and we anticipate ongoing cost discipline. Taken together, we project **operating income** to increase only modestly year-over-year in Q2 2025. The combination of double-digit revenue growth (mainly from Evernorth) and high-but-manageable expense growth should yield a slight uptick in operating profit. Additionally, interest expenses rose in 2024 (due to higher rates), which will temper pretax income.  

**Share Repurchases and EPS:** Cigna’s aggressive buyback program is boosting its per-share earnings. By Q1 2025 the company had already repurchased **$2.6 billion** in stock year-to-date ([www.stocktitan.net](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CI/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-sbwkhjm27d83.html#:~:text=,and%20income%20growth%20of%205)), reducing the share count. We expect further repurchases in Q2 using proceeds from the Medicare sale, which will amplify EPS growth. Even if net income is roughly flat to slightly up versus last year’s quarter, **EPS** in Q2 2025 should rise at a higher rate thanks to fewer shares outstanding. (For context, in Q2 2024 GAAP EPS was **$5.45** ([newsroom.thecignagroup.com](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/2024-08-01-The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=,1%2C2%7D%20is%20at%20least)); we foresee Q2 2025 EPS in the mid-$5 to low-$6 range, reflecting both operational performance and the share count reduction.)

**Free Cash Flow:** Cigna consistently generates strong cash flow from its businesses. In full-year 2024, operating cash flow exceeded **$10 billion** ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CI/cigna-group/cash-flow-from-operating-activities#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)). We anticipate healthy cash generation in Q2 2025 driven by stable operating earnings and manageable working-capital needs (pharmacy claims timing can cause quarterly swings, but no extraordinary outflows are expected this quarter). After capital expenditures (which are relatively modest for a services-focused company), **free cash flow** for Q2 2025 is projected around **$2 billion**. This level would be in line with Cigna’s typical quarterly cash flow, supporting continued shareholder returns (buybacks, dividends) and investment in growth.  

## Projected Q2 2025 Financials  
Based on the above drivers and our analysis of Cigna’s trends, below are our forecasts for **Q2 2025** key financial metrics. All figures are expressed as full dollar amounts (not in millions or billions):

| Company      | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|-------------|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Cigna Group | 2025 | 2       | 67,000,000,000  | 3,000,000,000  | 2,500,000,000    | 1,550,000,000   | 2,000,000,000    | 5.80  |

**Table: Cigna Group – Forecasted Q2 2025 results.** Revenue growth is driven by Evernorth’s expansion and premium increases, partially offset by the exited Medicare business. Profit metrics (EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income) reflect modest year-over-year improvement as cost pressures absorb some of the revenue gains. Free cash flow is expected to remain robust at roughly $2 billion for the quarter, and EPS is boosted by share repurchases in addition to underlying profit growth.

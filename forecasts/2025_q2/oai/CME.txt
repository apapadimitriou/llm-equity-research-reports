# CME Group – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Overview and Recent Performance  
CME Group entered Q2 2025 with strong momentum from the previous quarter. In Q1 2025, the company achieved **record revenue of $1.6 billion**, up 10% year-over-year (YoY), driven by heightened market volatility and hedging demand across all major asset classes ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,cost%20increase%2C%20CME%27s%20core%20business)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=performance%20was%20strong%2C%20experiencing%20record,rivals%20Cboe%20Global%20and%20Intercontinental)). Average daily trading volumes (ADV) in Q1 hit an all-time high of **29.8 million contracts** (about +13% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=performance%20was%20strong%2C%20experiencing%20record,rivals%20Cboe%20Global%20and%20Intercontinental)), reflecting broad-based growth in interest rate futures, equity indexes, commodities, and other products. This surge was fueled by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties – for instance, **U.S. tariff policy and global conflicts** spurred investors’ risk management activity ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=performance%20was%20strong%2C%20experiencing%20record,rivals%20Cboe%20Global%20and%20Intercontinental)). 

The comparable quarter last year (Q2 2024) also saw **record trading volumes**, with ADV reaching **25.9 million contracts per day** (+13.5% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exchange-operator-cmes-profit-beats-estimates-record-trading-volumes-2024-07-24/#:~:text=to%20CME%20achieving%20its%20highest,CME%27s)). That drove Q2 2024 **total revenue up ~13% YoY to $1.53 billion**, and GAAP operating income of about $1.0 billion ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-15-billion-q2-2024#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,Financial%20results)). GAAP net income for Q2 2024 was **$883 million** (EPS of $2.42) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-15-billion-q2-2024#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,Financial%20results)), or $932 million adjusted (EPS $2.56) after excluding one-time items ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-15-billion-q2-2024#:~:text=billion%20for%20the%20second%20quarter,of%202024%20and%202023%20exclude)). These historical benchmarks set a high base for Q2 2025 expectations.

## Q2 2025 Forecast Assumptions  
We anticipate **continued robust trading activity in Q2 2025**, building on Q1’s momentum. Ongoing **macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility** in Q2 likely sustained high futures and options volumes. Notably, **investor hedging demand** remained elevated amid shifting U.S. trade policies and geopolitical tensions (e.g. lingering tariff issues and global conflicts), similar to the trends seen in late Q1 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=performance%20was%20strong%2C%20experiencing%20record,rivals%20Cboe%20Global%20and%20Intercontinental)). We expect **broad participation across asset classes** – interest rate products (benefiting from interest-rate volatility), equity index futures (driven by equity market swings), and commodities – contributing to higher clearing and transaction fees. 

In forecasting Q2 2025, we assume CME achieves a **high-single to low-double-digit YoY increase in trading volumes**. With pricing (average rate per contract) roughly stable, this translates to about **10% YoY revenue growth** for the quarter. We also anticipate **slight operating margin expansion** as fixed costs are spread over higher revenues. CME’s expense discipline and modest expense growth (recall Q1 operating expenses rose just ~1% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,cost%20increase%2C%20CME%27s%20core%20business))) should allow incremental revenue to boost operating profits. Additionally, **non-operating items** (like interest income on customer collateral, given higher interest rates in 2025) likely provided an extra lift to net income. 

**Free cash flow** is expected to closely track earnings growth. CME’s business is highly cash-generative, with low capital expenditure needs relative to revenue. We project Q2 operating cash flow will remain strong (a function of net income plus depreciation/amortization), and after subtracting routine technology and clearing infrastructure investments, **free cash flow should roughly match or slightly exceed net income**. 

## Q2 2025 Forecast Summary  
The table below summarizes our projections for CME Group’s Q2 2025 financial metrics. All figures represent the forecast for the quarter (April–June 2025), expressed in full US dollars (not in millions or billions):

| Company    | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow   | EPS  |
|-----------|------|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|------|
| CME Group | 2025 | 2       | 1,680,000,000  | 1,180,000,000  | 1,100,000,000    | 1,020,000,000  | 1,100,000,000    | 2.85 |

**Key drivers:** We forecast **Revenue** of ~$1.68 billion in Q2 2025, about 10% higher than the $1.53 billion a year ago ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exchange-operator-cmes-profit-beats-estimates-record-trading-volumes-2024-07-24/#:~:text=to%20CME%20achieving%20its%20highest,CME%27s)), reflecting record trading volumes amid sustained volatility. **EBITDA** is projected at ~$1.18 billion, assuming CME’s high operating leverage and adding back roughly $85 million of depreciation and amortization. We expect **Operating Income** around $1.10 billion (an operating margin in the mid-60s, slightly above last year’s ~65% ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-15-billion-q2-2024#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,Financial%20results)) due to improved efficiency). **Net Income** is forecast at approximately $1.02 billion, representing a healthy YoY increase aided by strong revenue growth and additional interest income. This yields an **EPS** of about **$2.85** for the quarter (vs. $2.42 GAAP in Q2 2024 ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-15-billion-q2-2024#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,Financial%20results))), based on a relatively stable diluted share count. Finally, we project **Free Cash Flow** on the order of **$1.10 billion**, as CME’s net income plus non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization) comfortably cover its minimal capital expenditures, in line with historical cash conversion trends.

Overall, CME Group is poised for another record quarter in Q2 2025, with double-digit growth in revenue translating into robust profitability and cash flow, supported by **unprecedented trading activity** in its futures and options markets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exchange-operator-cmes-profit-beats-estimates-record-trading-volumes-2024-07-24/#:~:text=to%20CME%20achieving%20its%20highest,CME%27s)). This outlook assumes that the elevated volatility and risk management needs observed earlier in the year persisted through the second quarter, driving CME’s key financial metrics higher year-over-year.

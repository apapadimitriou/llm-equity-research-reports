# NVIDIA (NVDA) – 2025 Q2 Financial Forecast

## Recent Performance and Context

**Explosive AI-Driven Growth:** NVIDIA has experienced unprecedented revenue growth over the past year, fueled by surging demand for its data center GPUs used in generative AI and large-scale computing. In the first quarter of FY2026 (Feb–Apr 2025), NVIDIA’s revenue hit a record $44.1 billion – up **69% year-on-year** ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=Nvidia%20reported%20a%20remarkable%2069,billion%2C%20while%20adjusted%20gross%20margins)) – driven by **“strong demand for AI”** across cloud, enterprise, and consumer internet sectors. This far surpassed the $26 billion in revenue from the same quarter a year prior ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=,split%20basis)). NVIDIA’s *Hopper* and new *Blackwell* chips have been selling at full throttle, with CEO Jensen Huang noting that **“global data centers are in full throttle to modernize… with accelerated computing and generative AI”** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHopper%20demand%20remains%20strong%2C%20and,%E2%80%9D)). This AI boom has also dramatically expanded NVIDIA’s profitability – Q1 FY2026 net income was $18.8 billion (up 26% YoY) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=estimates,S)) – showcasing strong operating leverage from **~71% gross margins** on these high-value chips ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=estimates,S)).

**China Export Curbs and H100/H20 Chip Ban:** A key headwind in 2025 has been U.S. export restrictions on NVIDIA’s advanced AI chips to China. In April 2025, the U.S. government imposed a ban requiring licenses for NVIDIA’s **H20 GPUs** (a China-specific AI chip) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)). This led NVIDIA to incur a **$4.5 billion inventory writedown** and miss out on roughly **$2.5 billion of Q1 sales** that could not be shipped ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=reaching%20%2444,they%20may%20inadvertently%20strengthen%20Chinese)). Despite this setback, NVIDIA still delivered record results in Q1. For the upcoming quarter (2025 Q2), NVIDIA **guided $45 billion in revenue** (±2%) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,30%25%20range)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=reaching%20%2444,they%20may%20inadvertently%20strengthen%20Chinese)), explicitly **factoring in an ~$8 billion reduction** due to the China export limitations ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,30%25%20range)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=reaching%20%2444,they%20may%20inadvertently%20strengthen%20Chinese)). In other words, absent the ban, Q2 revenue might have approached ~$53 billion. This guidance was **slightly below some bullish analyst estimates** that had anticipated an even larger sequential jump ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=reaching%20%2444,they%20may%20inadvertently%20strengthen%20Chinese)), which tempered investor expectations. Notably, NVIDIA has been quick to adapt: it’s **repurposing materials and exploring modified chip versions** for China ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=chips%20to%20China%E2%80%94resulting%20in%20a,footprint%2C%20with%20Huang%20touring%20the)) to mitigate lost sales, and by July 2025 the U.S. government had **reversed the H20 ban**, allowing NVIDIA to **resume sales of H20 chips to China** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-republican-china-panel-objects-resumption-nvidia-h20-chip-shipments-2025-07-18/#:~:text=A%20top%20Republican%20lawmaker%2C%20Representative,Nvidia%20confirmed%20it)). This late-quarter policy change is a positive development but likely came **too late in Q2 to contribute meaningfully** to revenue. It does, however, pave the way for backlog orders from Chinese cloud giants (like Tencent and Alibaba) – who had **“significantly increased their H20 orders”** before the ban ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-orders-300000-h20-chips-tsmc-due-robust-china-demand-sources-say-2025-07-29/#:~:text=The%20H20%20GPU%20has%20become,significantly%20increased%20their%20H20%20orders)) – to be fulfilled in future quarters.

**Profitability and Cash Flow Trends:** NVIDIA’s operating expenses have been rising (investments in R&D, software, and support) but remain small relative to revenue. In Q1 FY2026, GAAP operating expenses were about **$5.03 billion** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Gross%20margin%20%20,%2815)), just ~11% of revenue, enabling exceptional operating margins. For Q2, management forecasts GAAP OpEx around **$5.7 billion** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=respectively%2C%20plus%20or%20minus%2050,plus%20or%20minus%201)) as the company scales expenses (hiring and R&D) roughly **mid-30% YoY** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20GAAP%20and%20non,excluding%20any%20discrete%20items)). Even so, with **gross margins ~72%** expected ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,30%25%20range)), NVIDIA should convert the majority of incremental revenue into profit. The export curbs primarily impact revenue volume; they haven’t dramatically hurt margins – Q1’s adjusted gross margin was **71.3%** excluding the one-time charge ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=estimates,S)). We anticipate Q2 gross margins in line with guidance (~72%), supporting robust **operating income** around the mid-$20 billions. 

NVIDIA’s **net income** is also poised to jump in Q2 versus the prior quarter. In Q1, net profit was held to $18.8 billion due to the non-recurring charge ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=reaching%20%2444,they%20may%20inadvertently%20strengthen%20Chinese)). With no such charge in Q2 and slightly higher sales, net income will likely rebound to the low-$20 billions (roughly matching the record $22.1 billion earned in Q4 FY2025) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,Y%2FY)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=Operating%20expenses%20%20,Down%203.2%20pts)). Additionally, NVIDIA’s aggressive share repurchases will boost its **EPS**. The company bought back **$14.1 billion of stock in Q1** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,)) (on top of $7.8 billion in Q4), reducing the share count. This means **even modest net income growth can yield a bigger jump in EPS**. We expect Q2 diluted EPS to approach **$0.94** (on a post-split basis), up from $0.76 in Q1 and ~$0.89 in Q4 ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%20,Q%2FQ)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=Operating%20expenses%20%20,Down%203.2%20pts)). 

Finally, NVIDIA’s **free cash flow** generation should remain very strong. Last year’s Q2 FCF was $13.5 billion ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,certain%20compensation%20charges%20and%20are)) when quarterly sales were $30 billion ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=,from%20a%20year%20ago)). Now with 50%+ higher revenue, FCF will rise correspondingly. NVIDIA converted over 90% of its FY2025 earnings to free cash flow ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=,GAAP)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025)), and we anticipate a similar **~$20 billion FCF** in 2025 Q2. This assumes operating cash flows remain high (helped by strong profits and some customers paying upfront to secure supply) but also accounts for **working capital needs** as NVIDIA builds inventory and receivables to support its blistering growth. Capital expenditures are increasing (Q1 saw ~$1.3 billion in capex) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,%29)) as NVIDIA invests in data centers and infrastructure, but these outlays are relatively minor compared to operating cash generation. Overall, NVIDIA’s cash flow outlook for Q2 is robust, underpinning its ongoing large buyback program and dividend.

## Q2 2025 Forecast – Key Financial Metrics

Given the above considerations, we forecast **NVIDIA’s 2025-Q2** financial results as follows:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|---------|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| NVIDIA  | 2025 | 2       | 45,500,000,000  | 28,000,000,000 | 27,000,000,000   | 23,000,000,000  | 20,000,000,000   | 0.94  |

**Key drivers:** We expect **Revenue** of ~$45.5 billion – in line with NVIDIA’s guidance ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,30%25%20range)) and ~50% higher than the $30.0 billion achieved in the year-ago quarter ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=,from%20a%20year%20ago)). This reflects continued explosive AI chip demand (especially for data centers), partially offset by lost China sales in April–June. **EBITDA** is projected around $28 billion, assuming ~62% EBITDA margin. NVIDIA’s **Operating Income** (EBIT) should be roughly $27 billion, given ~72% gross margins and ~$5.7 billion in operating costs ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,30%25%20range)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=respectively%2C%20plus%20or%20minus%2050,plus%20or%20minus%201)). We forecast **Net Income** of about $23 billion, implying a ~51% net margin. This jump from Q1’s $18.8 billion ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5f2c318b-39e6-4ce9-bcd4-d950aa5525c8#:~:text=estimates,S)) is due to the absence of one-time charges and slightly lower tax effects. **Free Cash Flow** is estimated at ~$20 billion, as strong earnings are only partly offset by working capital growth (to support higher sales) and ~$1+ billion of capital investments. Finally, we anticipate **EPS** of approximately $0.94 for the quarter, reflecting the elevated net income and a reduced share count from ongoing buybacks.

Overall, NVIDIA’s 2025-Q2 is set to demonstrate **exceptional growth and profitability**, albeit at a more moderated pace than the prior quarter’s breakneck surge (owing to the export headwinds). The company’s fundamentals remain extremely strong, and the slight sequential revenue increase to ~$45–46 billion (vs. $44.1 billion in Q1) underscores sustained **“full-throttle” demand for NVIDIA’s AI platforms** ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHopper%20demand%20remains%20strong%2C%20and,%E2%80%9D)) even as certain geopolitical challenges temporarily cap its upside. Looking ahead, with the China export license reinstated ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-republican-china-panel-objects-resumption-nvidia-h20-chip-shipments-2025-07-18/#:~:text=A%20top%20Republican%20lawmaker%2C%20Representative,chip%20sales%2C%20which%20is%20a)) and new products (Blackwell GPUs) ramping, NVIDIA is well-positioned for continued revenue and cash-flow growth in the second half of 2025. The above forecasts represent our best estimates as of August 13, 2025, based on publicly available data and NVIDIA’s own guidance. All values are expressed in absolute dollars (not millions or billions) for clarity in comparison.

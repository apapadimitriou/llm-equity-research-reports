## Palo Alto Networks (PANW) – Q2 2025 Forecast

Palo Alto Networks has sustained strong demand for its cybersecurity platforms, driving consistent double-digit revenue growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/palo-alto-raises-annual-revenue-forecast-steady-cybersecurity-demand-2025-02-13/#:~:text=2025%2C%20now%20expecting%20between%20%249,digital%20scams%20and%20security%20breaches)). For fiscal Q2 2025 (quarter ended Jan 31, 2025), management guided revenue of ~$2.22–2.25 billion (12–14% YoY growth) ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2024/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,to%20352%20million%20shares%20outstanding)). We expect **revenue** near the high end of this range (~14–15% YoY growth) as robust enterprise spending on network security and AI-powered offerings continues ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/palo-alto-raises-annual-revenue-forecast-steady-cybersecurity-demand-2025-02-13/#:~:text=2025%2C%20now%20expecting%20between%20%249,digital%20scams%20and%20security%20breaches)) ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2024/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,to%20352%20million%20shares%20outstanding)). This implies revenue around **$2.28 billion** for Q2 2025, up from $2.0 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2024/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20for%20the%20fiscal,GAAP)).  

Profitability is improving markedly. Palo Alto’s operating expenses are growing more slowly than revenues, and Q2 last year included heavy investments (GAAP operating income was only ~$53.6 million) ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%20,268.8)). We project **Operating Income** around **$240 million** for Q2 2025, implying roughly a 10% GAAP operating margin (vs. ~3% in Q2 2024). Adding back depreciation and amortization, **EBITDA** is estimated at about **$330 million** for the quarter. Higher operating margins and revenue should boost **Net Income** despite the absence of last year’s one-time tax benefit. (Notably, Q2 2024 GAAP net income was $1.7 billion due to a $1.5 billion deferred tax allowance release ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2024/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=quarter%202023,of%20the%20company%27s%20valuation%20allowance)). Excluding that one-off benefit, underlying net profit was ~\$200 million.) We forecast Q2 2025 **Net Income** of roughly **$270 million**, reflecting solid growth over the normalized prior-year level. 

Cash flow generation remains a key strength. Palo Alto’s **Free Cash Flow** is expected to be robust in Q2 2025 – we estimate approximately **$700 million**. The first half of fiscal 2025 produced $1.97 billion in free cash flow ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1327567/000132756725000010/panw-20250131.htm#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%28non,72.0)), aided by large collections of prior quarter billings. Q2’s contribution should be slightly lower than Q1’s (which benefited from seasonally strong collections), but continued business growth and high subscription renewal rates support a healthy free cash flow margin for the quarter. 

Finally, we anticipate **EPS** (non-GAAP) around **$0.80** for Q2 2025. This is an increase from $0.73 (adjusted) in Q2 2024 ([www.paloaltonetworks.com](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Non,contained%20in%20the%20tables%20below)), driven by higher revenue and improved operating leverage. The table below summarizes our projections for Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal Q2 2025:

| Company             | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA       | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|---------------------|------|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| Palo Alto Networks  | 2025 | 2       | 2280000000    | 330000000    | 240000000        | 270000000    | 700000000      | 0.80 |

# Synopsys Inc. – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Revenue Outlook
Synopsys is expected to post robust revenue growth in the second quarter of 2025, driven by strong demand for chip design software amid trends like AI-focused semiconductors. We forecast Q2 2025 revenue of approximately **$1.61 billion**, which represents roughly 10% year-over-year growth from the $1.455 billion achieved in the year-ago quarter ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=Inc,quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202024)). This estimate is near the high end of management’s guidance range of $1.585–$1.615 billion for the quarter ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20995)), reflecting our expectation that Synopsys will slightly outperform its guidance. The growth is supported by the “mission-critical nature” of Synopsys’ products and continued healthy demand, as noted by the company’s CEO ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=,to%20help%20customers%20innovate%20faster)). Even with a slightly shorter fiscal period in the first half of 2025 (due to a calendar change reducing first-half days) ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=year%20from%20a%2052%2F53,eight%20fewer%20days%20in%20the)), Synopsys’ core EDA and IP business is demonstrating resilience and double-digit growth momentum.

## Profitability and Margin Expectations
We anticipate **EBITDA** of about **$480 million** in Q2 2025 and **Operating Income** (GAAP) of roughly **$380 million**. This implies an operating profit margin around 24%, a modest increase from the ~22.8% margin in Q2 2024 (when operating income was $332 million on $1.455 billion revenue) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883241/000119312525129525/d815632dex991.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L778%20GAAP%20total,)). Synopsys has been focusing on operational efficiencies, and the company reaffirmed its full-year operating margin guidance after a strong Q1 ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=,healthy%20demand%20for%20our%20products)), signaling confidence in margin expansion. Our EBITDA projection adds back approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization to the GAAP operating profit, consistent with recent quarters’ D&A expense. 

For **Net Income**, we forecast about **$360 million** for Q2 2025, which would be a solid increase over the $299 million earned in the year-ago quarter ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883241/000119312525129525/d815632dex991.htm#:~:text=share%2C%20compared%20to%20%24299,quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202024)). This corresponds to an **EPS** (diluted) of roughly **$2.30**, slightly above the midpoint of the company’s Q2 guidance range of $2.21–$2.33 ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%2014.96)). Strong revenue growth and a slightly improved operating margin are expected to drive this earnings increase. Our EPS forecast represents a meaningful jump from the $1.92 GAAP EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883241/000119312525129525/d815632dex991.htm#:~:text=share%2C%20compared%20to%20%24299,quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202024)), reflecting both higher revenue and improved profitability. We note that Synopsys often reports **non-GAAP** earnings that exclude stock-based compensation and other items; however, our forecasts here are on a GAAP basis, aligning with the standard definitions of the listed metrics.

## Free Cash Flow Projection
Synopsys’ **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** for Q2 2025 is projected at approximately **$180 million**. The company’s full-year FY2025 target for free cash flow is about $1.6 billion ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=%7C%20~%241%2C800%20Free%20Cash%20Flow,~%24170)), with a heavier weighting in the second half of the year due to the fiscal calendar shift (which resulted in fewer days in the first half) ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=year%20from%20a%2052%2F53,eight%20fewer%20days%20in%20the)). In the year-ago period, operating cash flow was unusually strong (around $389 million in Q2 2024) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SNPS/synopsys/cash-flow-from-operating-activities#:~:text=,407B%2C%20a)), benefiting from timing of customer payments and billings. Given the shorter reporting period and some deals likely billing later in the year, we expect Q2 2025 FCF to be lower than last year’s Q2. Our $180 million FCF forecast assumes operating cash generation in Q2 moderates year-over-year, combined with capital expenditures roughly in line with the company’s plan (about $170 million CapEx for the full year ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2025-02-26-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=%7C%20~%241%2C800%20Free%20Cash%20Flow,~%24170)), implying ~$40–45 million per quarter). Overall, this anticipated cash flow in Q2 is consistent with Synopsys’ commentary that operating cash flow will ramp up in the second half of 2025, following a lighter first half.

## Bank of America 2025-Q2 Forecast and Key Drivers

**Recent Performance & Outlook:** Bank of America (BAC) entered Q2 2025 with strong momentum from Q1. First-quarter 2025 net income was $7.4 billion ($0.90 per share), up from $6.7 billion ($0.76) a year earlier ([finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=49b1033b20d612a13c76f597f9b59d2b8cc8c1e1bec0ada96445cf579ef5215f#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%247,offset%20by%20higher%20noninterest%20expense)). This growth was driven by higher revenue in both net interest income and noninterest income (particularly trading), partially offset by higher expenses ([finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=49b1033b20d612a13c76f597f9b59d2b8cc8c1e1bec0ada96445cf579ef5215f#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%247,offset%20by%20higher%20noninterest%20expense)). In Q1, trading revenue surged 9% year-over-year amid volatile markets – equities trading hit a record $2.2 billion and fixed income trading rose 5% to $3.5 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=analyst%20expectations%20with%20a%20profit,4%20billion%2C%20with%20the%20bank)). Net interest income (NII) also climbed ~3% in Q1 to $14.4 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=driven%20by%20a%209,4%20billion%2C%20with%20the%20bank)) as higher interest rates and loan growth expanded interest earnings, and Bank of America management anticipated further NII growth into 2025 (targeting $15.5–$15.7 billion by Q4 2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-investment-banking-boost-2025-01-16/#:~:text=interest%20income%20grew%203,by%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of)). This backdrop informed our Q2 forecast, alongside year-ago comparables and macro trends.

**Revenue:** We project Q2 2025 revenue of roughly **$26.4 billion**, a mid-single-digit increase over the $25.4 billion in the year-ago quarter ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20Reports%202Q24,to%20%2411.7%20Billion)). Key factors include modest NII growth and solid noninterest income. **NII** is expected to be slightly higher year-on-year as elevated interest rates and loan repricing offset pressure from higher deposit costs. (For reference, NII was $13.7 billion in Q2 2024 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=,9%20billion%20FTE%29%2C%28B%29%20as%20higher)) after a 3% YoY decline, but BofA projected record NII in 2025 with ~6–7% annual growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-investment-banking-boost-2025-01-16/#:~:text=interest%20income%20grew%203,by%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of)).) **Noninterest income** should also contribute: trading revenues likely remained strong in Q2 given continued market volatility, extending BofA’s streak of year-over-year trading gains (Q2 2024 marked the ninth consecutive quarter of trading revenue growth ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=its%20ninth%20consecutive%20quarter%20of,are%20delivering%20for%20our%20shareholders))). Investment banking fees, which were soft last year, could stabilize or improve slightly by Q2 2025 if capital markets activity picked up. Meanwhile, wealth management income should benefit from higher asset valuations (in Q4 2024, wealth/investment management revenues jumped 15% YoY amid market gains ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-investment-banking-boost-2025-01-16/#:~:text=of%20year,mirroring%20the%20strong%20performance%20of))). Overall, these trends point to total revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits year-on-year.

**Expenses and Operating Income:** We expect Bank of America to continue rigorous cost control. In Q1, the bank trimmed its workforce (ending Q1 with ~212,732 employees) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=activity,the%20announcement%20of%20new%20tariffs)), indicating efforts to contain salary and operating costs. Nonetheless, expenses will face upward pressure from wage inflation and ongoing technology investments. In Q2 2024, noninterest expense was $16.3 billion ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=Total%20revenue%2C%20net%20of%20interest,8.0)); for Q2 2025 we assume a slight increase (on the order of 2–3% YoY) as efficiency efforts largely offset inflation. Credit costs are likely to remain elevated. Bank of America has been building reserves in response to economic uncertainty – for example, it recorded a $1.5 billion provision for credit losses in Q1 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Despite%20strong%20trading%20performance%2C%20investment,senior%20roles%2C%20reducing%20its%20total)). We anticipate a similar provision in Q2 2025 (around $1.5–1.6 billion), roughly in line with the $1.5 billion provision in Q2 2024 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=Total%20revenue%2C%20net%20of%20interest,8.0)), reflecting a cautious outlook on consumer credit amid higher interest rates. Combining these factors, **operating income (pre-tax)** is forecast around **$8.1 billion** (up slightly from an estimated ~$7.6 billion a year ago) as revenue growth outpaces the modest rise in expenses and provisions. We estimate **EBITDA** (a less common metric for banks) at about **$8.6 billion**, adding back an approximate $0.5 billion of depreciation/amortization to operating profit.

**Net Income & EPS:** With operating profit up modestly, we project **net income** of roughly **$7.0 billion** for Q2 2025, a slight increase over the $6.9 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20Reports%202Q24,to%20%2411.7%20Billion)). This takes into account a more normalized effective tax rate compared to the unusually low tax in the year-ago quarter. Bank of America’s large ongoing share repurchases should enhance EPS growth relative to net income. The company has been aggressively returning capital to shareholders – its average diluted share count fell significantly over the past year due to buybacks. We forecast **EPS** of about **$0.88** for Q2 2025, up from $0.83 in Q2 2024 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20Reports%202Q24,to%20%2411.7%20Billion)) (approximately +6% YoY). This EPS gain reflects both the slight uptick in net income and the reduced share count from buybacks. 

**Free Cash Flow:** Banks’ **free cash flow (FCF)** can fluctuate widely quarter-to-quarter because changes in loans and deposits impact operating cash flow. For example, Bank of America’s FCF swung from a +$2.6 billion inflow in Q2 2024 to a –$34.7 billion outflow in Q3 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2025,11%2C300.00)), driven by shifts in balance sheet assets and funding. We expect Q2 2025 FCF to be **positive but modest (around $2 billion)**. This assumes relatively stable deposit balances and no large **extraordinary** uses of cash. Loan growth in the quarter (which uses cash) likely remained moderate – in Q2 2024 BofA’s average loans grew only ~2% YoY ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release-47390944/#:~:text=by%20investments%20in%20people%20and,D)) – so it shouldn’t drastically swing cash flow. Essentially, Q2 2025 free cash generation should roughly track net income with minor adjustments for any loan funding or timing differences in working capital. 

The table below summarizes our forecasts for Bank of America’s 2025 Q2 results:

| Company           | Year | Quarter | Revenue           | EBITDA          | Operating Income  | Net Income       | Free Cash Flow    | EPS   |
|-------------------|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Bank of America   | 2025 | 2       | 26,400,000,000    | 8,600,000,000   | 8,100,000,000     | 7,000,000,000    | 2,000,000,000     | 0.88  |

**Forecast Rationale:** Our projections reflect a continuation of trends observed in recent quarters and management’s guidance, using only information available up to July 2, 2025. In summary, we anticipate that **higher net interest income** (thanks to the rate environment and loan growth) and **solid trading and fee revenues** will drive moderate top-line growth for Bank of America in Q2 2025. **Expense discipline** and a stable credit outlook help convert that revenue into slightly higher profits year-over-year, while ongoing share buybacks boost the per-share earnings. Free cash flow is expected to be positive, albeit not as large as net income, given the capital needed to support loan growth and other working capital dynamics in the banking business. Overall, Bank of America’s Q2 2025 should show resilient performance, building on the strength demonstrated in the first quarter of the year.

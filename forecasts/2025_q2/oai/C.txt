# Citigroup 2025 Q2 Forecast

## Revenue Outlook (Q2 2025)
Citigroup’s revenue in **Q2 2024** was about $20.14 billion (up 4% year-over-year) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/citigroup-c-earnings-q2-2024.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20net%20income,to%20%2420.14%20billion)), driven by a rebound in Wall Street activity – equities trading surged 37% and investment banking fees jumped 60% from a weak prior year ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/citigroup-c-earnings-q2-2024.html#:~:text=Equities%20trading%20revenue%20rose%2037,more%20than%20the%20StreetAccount%20estimate)). Building on this momentum, **Q1 2025** saw revenues climb to $21.60 billion (approximately +3% YoY) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/citigroup-c-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20profit%20rose,in%20its%20five%20major%20divisions)), with particularly strong trading results (fixed-income trading up 8% to $4.5 billion and equities up 23% to $1.5 billion) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/citigroup-c-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=,activity%20led%20to%20more%20transactions)). Given this trend, we expect **Q2 2025** revenue to continue growing at a mid-single-digit pace. **Higher net interest income** (benefiting from still-elevated interest rates and modest loan growth) is likely to contribute, as Citi’s management guided for ~2–3% net interest income growth in 2025 ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/app/research/companies/C/earnings/Q1%202025#:~:text=4,loan%20growth%20across%20key%20segments)). Additionally, **non-interest revenues** (like trading and investment banking) should remain strong, albeit with more moderate gains than the exceptional rebound seen last year. Overall, we forecast Q2 2025 revenue of roughly **$21.5 billion**, reflecting about a 6–7% YoY increase on the improved prior-year base.

## Expense and Profitability Outlook 
Citigroup has been executing on cost-cutting and business simplification, which already yielded a **2% YoY drop in operating expenses in Q2 2024** ([www.investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/citigroup-earnings-q2-fy2024-8677071#:~:text=The%20bank%27s%20operating%20expenses%20fell,ACL)) and a larger 5% expense reduction in Q1 2025 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/citigroup-c-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20profit%20rose,in%20its%20five%20major%20divisions)). Management has indicated that some **expense uptick in Q2 2025** is expected as investments continue ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/app/research/companies/C/earnings/Q1%202025#:~:text=6,year%20target%20near%20%2453.4B)), but full-year expenses are still targeted around $53.4 billion – essentially flat, indicating ongoing discipline. We therefore assume **Q2 2025 operating expenses** will be roughly in line with the year-ago ~$13.4 billion level (perhaps slightly higher around $13.5 billion). This cost control, combined with revenue growth, should improve operating leverage. 

We also anticipate **credit costs** to remain elevated but manageable. In Q2 2024 Citi’s provision for credit losses was approximately $2.7 billion (higher due to rising card loan losses, partially offset by a reserve release) ([www.investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/citigroup-earnings-q2-fy2024-8677071#:~:text=match%20at%20L35%20The%20bank%27s,ACL)). For Q2 2025, with the macro environment slightly uncertain and consumer credit normalization ongoing, we project provisions around **$3.0 billion** (a modest increase year-over-year). This would still be supported by Citi’s cautious underwriting and existing reserves. 

Taking these factors together, our forecast for **Q2 2025 operating income** (pre-tax profit) is about **$5.0 billion**. This represents a solid improvement from the approximately $4.0 billion pre-tax income in Q2 2024, driven by higher revenue and stable expenses. On an EBITDA basis (adding back roughly $1 billion of quarterly depreciation/amortization), we project **EBITDA** of around **$6.0 billion** for the quarter.

**Net income** is expected to rise significantly year-over-year. In Q2 2024, Citi reported net income of $3.22 billion ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/citigroup-c-earnings-q2-2024.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20net%20income,to%20%2420.14%20billion)). In **Q1 2025**, net profit was already $4.1 billion (up 21% YoY) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/citigroup-c-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20profit%20rose,in%20its%20five%20major%20divisions)) thanks to revenue growth and cost cuts. For Q2 2025, our estimates yield a net income around **$3.75 billion**, which would be roughly a **16% increase** versus the prior-year quarter. This assumes Citi’s effective tax rate remains near ~25%, consistent with recent quarters.

## Free Cash Flow and EPS 
Banks typically generate substantial operating cash flow from earnings, but **free cash flow (FCF)** must account for ongoing investments in technology and operations. Citi spent about **$1.5 billion on capital expenditures** (property, equipment, and software) in Q1 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100125000086/c-20250331.htm#:~:text=Capital%20expenditures%20on%20premises%20and,162)) as part of its transformation strategy, and a similar investment level is likely in Q2. Using net income plus non-cash charges minus capex as a proxy, we project **free cash flow** on the order of **$3.5 billion** for Q2 2025. This indicates Citi should continue generating healthy excess cash beyond its capital investment needs, which can support dividends and buybacks.

Notably, Citigroup has been returning capital to shareholders aggressively. In Q1 2025 management repurchased **$1.75 billion of stock** ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/app/research/companies/C/earnings/Q1%202025#:~:text=,growth%20and%20improves%20shareholder%20value)), accelerating the buyback pace to boost shareholder returns. We expect ongoing buybacks in Q2 2025, which will **reduce the share count** and thereby enhance **earnings per share**. Based on our net income forecast and the lower share count, we estimate **Q2 2025 EPS** of approximately **$1.82**. This would mark strong growth from the $1.52 EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/citigroup-c-earnings-q2-2024.html#:~:text=The%20bank%20said%20net%20income,to%20%2420.14%20billion)), reflecting improved profitability and the positive impact of share repurchases. 

Finally, the table below summarizes our forecasts for Citigroup’s key Q2 2025 financial metrics:

| Company   | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |

| Citigroup | 2025 | 2       | 21,500,000,000  | 6,000,000,000 | 5,000,000,000    | 3,750,000,000   | 3,500,000,000    | 1.82  |

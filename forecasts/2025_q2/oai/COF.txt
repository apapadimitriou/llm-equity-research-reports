# Capital One (COF) – Q2 2025 Forecast

Capital One’s second quarter 2025 results will reflect the mid-quarter acquisition of Discover Financial Services (closed May 18, 2025 ([wtop.com](https://wtop.com/business-finance/2025/04/capital-one-35-billion-purchase-of-discover-financial-gets-regulatory-approvals/#:~:text=Capital%20One%2C%20based%20in%20McLean%2C,the%20deal%20i%20n%20February))). We anticipate a sharp increase in **Revenue** for Q2 2025, driven by both organic growth and roughly six weeks of Discover’s operations. Capital One reported $10.0 billion in total net revenue in Q1 2025 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-14-billion-or/#:~:text=,decrease%20of%2010%20basis%20points)), up from $9.5 billion in Q2 2024 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-597-million/#:~:text=,6%20billion)). For reference, Discover generated about $3.66 billion of net interest income in Q3 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/discover-financial-quarterly-profit-jumps-robust-interest-income-lower-2024-10-16/#:~:text=2024,increase%20from)) – implying that a partial-quarter inclusion of Discover could add nearly $1.8 billion to Capital One’s Q2 revenue. We therefore forecast **Revenue** of approximately **$12.2 billion** for Q2 2025, a significant jump quarter-over-quarter. 

Profitability, however, is expected to decline due to substantial one-time costs. In Q2 2024, Capital One’s net income dropped 61% year-over-year as it **“stockpiled more money for loan losses,”** i.e. increased its credit loss provision ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/capital-one-profit-declines-61-net-charge-offs-rise-2024-07-23/#:~:text=2024,35)). That quarter saw a $1.3 billion build in loan loss reserves ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-597-million/#:~:text=%2A%20Pre,3%20billion%20loan%20reserve%20build)), which drove net income down to $597 million (EPS $1.38). In Q2 2025, the required **provision for credit losses** will be far larger as Capital One must establish **CECL** reserves for Discover’s entire loan portfolio upfront. We estimate several billion dollars of additional provision expense this quarter, on top of Capital One’s typical ~$2½–3 billion quarterly credit costs. Consequently, **Operating Income** (pre-tax) will likely swing to a **loss**. We project an **Operating Income** around **–$5.0 billion** (negative), versus +$651 million in Q2 2024 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-597-million/)). 

In addition, **integration and restructuring expenses** will weigh on results. Capital One has been incurring merger-related costs (e.g. $110 million in Q1 2025) in preparation for the Discover integration ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-14-billion-or/#:~:text=Discover%20integration%20expenses%20%20,42)). With the deal closing in Q2, these expenses (severance, systems integration, advisory fees, etc.) should spike. We expect hundreds of millions in one-time charges, contributing to a projected **EBITDA** of roughly **–$4.2 billion** (adding back depreciation and amortization to the operating loss). After accounting for taxes, we forecast **Net Income** about **–$4.3 billion**, translating to an **EPS** around **–$8.50** for Q2 2025 (a large loss per share due to the one-time charges). 

Despite the GAAP loss, Capital One’s underlying cash generation remains solid. Loan loss provisioning is a non-cash expense (reserves), so it does not directly reduce operating cash flow. In fact, the company produced about $4.3 billion of free cash flow in Q1 2025 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/COF/capital-one-financial/free-cash-flow#:~:text=,56)). We expect **Free Cash Flow** to stay **positive** in Q2 – on the order of **$6.0 billion** – as core earnings and Discover’s contribution (plus reserve build add-backs) should more than cover any increase in capital expenditures. The table below summarizes our Q2 2025 forecasts for Capital One:

| Company     | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS    |
|------------|------|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Capital One | 2025 | 2       | 12,200,000,000 | -4,200,000,000 | -5,000,000,000   | -4,300,000,000  | 6,000,000,000    | -8.50  |

**Forecast Highlights:** The **Revenue** forecast of ~$12.2 billion reflects ~28% growth over the prior year’s $9.5 billion ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-597-million/#:~:text=,6%20billion)), boosted by the Discover acquisition. We assume **EBITDA** and **Operating Income** turn negative due to an estimated ~$7–8 billion credit provision for acquired loans and ~$0.5+ billion in merger costs, outweighing pre-provision operating profits. **Net Income** is consequently projected at a loss of roughly $4.3 billion (vs. +$597 million in Q2 2024 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-597-million/))). **Free Cash Flow** remains positive (~$6.0 billion) as the provisioning impact is non-cash. **EPS** is forecast at approximately –$8.50, based on a higher share count post-merger and the net loss for the quarter. These forecasts incorporate known financial trends up through July 8, 2025 and publicly available data, but actual results could vary depending on credit quality outcomes and final purchase accounting adjustments.

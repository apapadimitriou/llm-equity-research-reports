# Merck & Co. (MRK) – Q2 2025 Forecast

*As of mid-July 2025, we project Merck & Co.’s financial performance for the second quarter of 2025, based on available public information up to July 15, 2025.* 

## Key Drivers and Assumptions

- **Revenue Trends:** We expect Q2 2025 revenue to slightly decline year-over-year from the $16.1 billion reported in Q2 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-second-quarter-tops-street-view-strong-keytruda-sales-2024-07-30/#:~:text=earnings%20were%20%242,Merck%20raised%20its)). The drop is driven primarily by sharply lower sales of the HPV vaccine **Gardasil** due to the **pause in shipments to China** amid weak demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,setback%2C%20Keytruda%20sales%20exceeded%20expectations)). In Q1 2025, Merck’s sales fell 2% (to $15.5 billion) as Gardasil plummeted 41% year-on-year ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=%245,to%20%241.6%20billion)), and a similar impact is anticipated in Q2. Outside China, Gardasil demand remains solid, but it cannot fully offset the lost China volume. 

- **Key Product Performance:** Merck’s cancer immunotherapy **Keytruda** continues to be the largest revenue contributor. In Q2 2024, Keytruda sales were $7.3 billion (up 16% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-second-quarter-tops-street-view-strong-keytruda-sales-2024-07-30/#:~:text=earnings%20were%20%242,Merck%20raised%20its)). However, growth has begun to moderate – in Q1 2025 Keytruda rose just 4% YoY to $7.2 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=billion%2C%20attributed%20to%20a%20temporary,Animal%20health%20revenues%20increased)). We project **Keytruda** will see mid-single-digit growth in Q2 2025 (a more modest increase compared to 2024’s double-digit gains) as it faces a higher base and some market saturation. This should partially **offset the Gardasil decline**. Newer products like the pulmonary therapy **Winrevair** (launched in 2024) are ramping up and contributed $280 million in Q1 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=billion%2C%20attributed%20to%20a%20temporary,to%20%241.6%20billion)) – we expect continued incremental gains from these launches in Q2.

- **Other Segments:** The **Animal Health** division is steadily growing (up 5% to $1.6 billion in Q1 2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=met%20analyst%20projections,to%20%241.6%20billion)), and we expect a similar mid-single-digit increase in Q2. Meanwhile, some older pharmaceutical franchises are in decline. For example, the diabetes drugs **Januvia/Janumet** have been falling due to patent expirations (down 27% YoY in Q2 2024) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=JANUVIA%2FJANUMET%20%20,Growth%20largely%20from)) – we anticipate continued erosion in this category, which will be a minor drag on revenue. COVID-19 antiviral **Lagevrio** sales are now minimal (Q2 2024 sales were only $110 million, down 46% YoY ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=LAGEVRIO%20%20,following))) and are expected to remain very low in Q2 2025.

- **Profitability and Margins:** With overall revenue under pressure from the high-margin Gardasil decline, we project slightly **lower profitability** in Q2 2025 versus the prior year. Merck’s full-year 2025 guidance (reaffirmed after Q1) was $64.1–65.6 billion in sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Gardasil%27s%20quarterly%20sales%20dropping%20to,setback%2C%20Keytruda%20sales%20exceeded%20expectations)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)) – essentially flat vs. 2024 – reflecting these headwinds. The company also trimmed its 2025 earnings per share outlook to $8.82–$8.97 (from about $8.90–$9.03) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)), citing about $200 million in additional tariff costs and a licensing charge ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=billion%2C%20but%20slightly%20lowered%20its,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)). We factor in these cost headwinds for Q2, expecting **operating expenses** to remain high (Merck continues to invest in R&D and new launches) and **one-time charges** (e.g. the Hengrui licensing fee) to weigh on GAAP earnings. As a result, **operating income and net income** for Q2 2025 will likely be lower than last year’s Q2 (which had GAAP net profit of $5.5 billion) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-second-quarter-tops-street-view-strong-keytruda-sales-2024-07-30/#:~:text=Merck%20%26%20Co%20exceeded%20second,billion%20but%20reduced%20its%20earnings)). We foresee a solid operating margin around 30–34%, but down from Q2 2024’s levels. 

- **Free Cash Flow:** Merck’s cash generation should remain strong in Q2 2025. Even with lower earnings, the company’s high-margin pharma business and manageable capital expenditures support robust **free cash flow**. We expect FCF to be roughly in line with net income (with depreciation/amortization added back and capex subtracted). There may be some working capital benefit from reduced inventories given the shipment pause in China. Overall, we project Q2 FCF modestly below the year-ago quarter as lower Gardasil sales reduce cash inflows.

Below is our forecast for Merck’s Q2 2025 financial metrics, presented in full dollar amounts (not in millions or billions):

| Company      | Year | Quarter | Revenue           | EBITDA           | Operating Income   | Net Income        | Free Cash Flow    | EPS   |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Merck & Co. | 2025 | 2       | 15,700,000,000    | 6,500,000,000    | 5,300,000,000      | 4,400,000,000     | 4,800,000,000     | 1.70  |

**Notes:** This forecast assumes no major unforeseen events or one-time gains/losses in late Q2 2025 beyond the known factors discussed. It is based on management’s guidance and recent performance trends (Keytruda growth, Gardasil weakness in China, etc.) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=%245,to%20%241.6%20billion)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,setback%2C%20Keytruda%20sales%20exceeded%20expectations)), as well as typical seasonal patterns in Merck’s business. The EPS is calculated on an estimated share count of roughly 2.55 billion shares. All figures are in U.S. dollars. The projections are the analyst’s own, using only publicly available data up to July 15, 2025, and may differ from eventual reported results or other analysts’ estimates.

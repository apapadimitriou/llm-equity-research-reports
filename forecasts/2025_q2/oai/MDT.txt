According to Medtronic’s latest filings and guidance, we expect **mid-single-digit revenue growth** in 2025-Q2, driven by strong demand for medical devices (especially in cardiovascular and diabetes segments) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/medtronic-lifts-annual-profit-view-strong-demand-medical-devices-2024-11-19/#:~:text=slightly%20exceeding%20analysts%E2%80%99%20estimates,second%20quarter%2C%20meeting%20market%20expectations)). This growth, combined with improved operating efficiency, should expand margins – **operating profit is forecast to rise** as costs are managed and last year’s one-time charges (e.g. ventilator exit costs) are absent ([news.medtronic.com](https://news.medtronic.com/2024-11-19-Medtronic-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results#:~:text=As%20reported%2C%20Q2%20GAAP%20net,on%20a)). Net income is projected to increase accordingly, further boosted by share buybacks reducing the share count. We anticipate **free cash flow to be positive but below net income**, reflecting a typical early-year working capital build (H1 free cash flow is usually much lower than H2) ([news.medtronic.com](https://news.medtronic.com/2024-11-19-Medtronic-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20721)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medtronic-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results-302378617.html#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%202%2C849)). The table below summarizes our 2025-Q2 forecasts for Medtronic:  

| Company       | Year | Quarter | Revenue      | EBITDA       | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|--------------|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| Medtronic plc | 2025 | 2       | 8,546,000,000 | 2,070,000,000 | 1,400,000,000    | 1,100,000,000 | 800,000,000    | 0.86 |

**Key Drivers and Assumptions:** Medtronic guided ~5% organic revenue growth for FY2026 ([news.medtronic.com](https://news.medtronic.com/2025-05-21-Medtronic-reports-strong-finish-to-its-fiscal-year-with-its-fourth-quarter-financial-results-announces-dividend-increase#:~:text=The%20company%20is%20guiding%20to,to%205.1)), so we model Q2 2025 sales about 5% higher year-on-year. In the prior quarter, heart devices revenue grew ~6% and diabetes ~12% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/medtronic-lifts-annual-profit-view-strong-demand-medical-devices-2024-11-19/#:~:text=slightly%20exceeding%20analysts%E2%80%99%20estimates,second%20quarter%2C%20meeting%20market%20expectations)), trends we expect to continue with new product momentum. We forecast **EBITDA** and **Operating Income** margins to improve slightly as Medtronic demonstrated ongoing gross margin and cost discipline improvements ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medtronic-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results-302378617.html#:~:text=,most%20attractive%20markets%20in%20MedTech)). The **EPS** forecast of $0.86 reflects the higher net income and a modest decrease in shares outstanding due to $6.3 billion returned to shareholders in FY25 ([news.medtronic.com](https://news.medtronic.com/2025-05-21-Medtronic-reports-strong-finish-to-its-fiscal-year-with-its-fourth-quarter-financial-results-announces-dividend-increase#:~:text=,2%20billion)). Finally, our **Free Cash Flow** outlook accounts for increased capital expenditures and working capital needs early in the fiscal year, in line with the first-half free cash flow being only about 20% of Medtronic’s annual total in the previous year ([news.medtronic.com](https://news.medtronic.com/2024-11-19-Medtronic-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20721)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medtronic-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results-302378617.html#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%202%2C849)).

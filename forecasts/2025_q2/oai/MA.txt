# Mastercard 2025 Q2 Financial Forecast

## Recent Performance & Outlook

**Strong prior results:** Mastercard delivered robust growth in 2024, with Q2 2024 net revenue reaching $7.0 billion (up 11% year-over-year) and net income of $3.3 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%24%20in%20billions%2C%20except%20per,17)). This momentum continued into 2025. In Q1 2025, net revenue grew 14% year-over-year (17% on a currency-neutral basis) aided by a 15% surge in cross-border volume ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000088/ma03312025-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20started%202025%20strong%20with,%E2%80%9D)). Mastercard’s CEO highlighted “healthy consumer spending” and “robust cross-border volume growth” as key drivers ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20delivered%20another%20strong%20quarter,%E2%80%9D)), alongside double-digit growth in value-added services revenue. 

**Management guidance:** Management remains optimistic but cautious. The CFO indicated that for 2025, **net revenues** are expected to grow at the *“high end of a low double digits to low teens range”* (on a currency-neutral basis) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Outlook%20%26%20Guidance)). Specifically for Q2 2025, Mastercard anticipated year-over-year net revenue growth in the **low teens** (excluding acquisitions), with acquisitions adding ~1–1.5 percentage points and minimal currency impact ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Now%20turning%20to%20the%20second,excluding%20acquisitions%20and%20special%20items)). **Operating expenses** were projected to rise at the low end of low double digits, plus an additional ~4–5 percentage points from acquisitions ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Now%20turning%20to%20the%20second,excluding%20acquisitions%20and%20special%20items)). This suggests Q2 operating costs would increase roughly in line with revenues, implying operating margins remaining around mid-50s%. Notably, **cross-border travel** remained a growth engine; through late April 2025, total cross-border volume was up about 16% year-to-date ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=and%20cross%20border%20volumes%20also,on%20a%20local%20currency%20basis)), indicating continued strong consumer spending on international travel and e-commerce. 

**Revenue forecast:** Given these trends, we forecast Q2 2025 revenue of approximately **$8.0 billion**. This represents roughly 14% growth year-over-year, in line with management’s outlook for low-teens growth (and slightly above Q2 2024’s 11% gain) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%24%20in%20billions%2C%20except%20per,17)) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Now%20turning%20to%20the%20second,excluding%20acquisitions%20and%20special%20items)). The increase will likely be driven by solid growth in payment volume and transactions, sustained cross-border momentum, and continued demand for Mastercard’s value-added services (which grew ~18–19% in Q2 2024) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=CEO,realize%20even%20more%20of%20the)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=an%20increase%20in%20our%20key,as%20new%20and%20renewed%20deals)). We anticipate **payment network revenues** to rise on high-single-digit to low-double-digit volume growth, and **value-added services** to grow in the high-teens, aided by prior acquisitions and new services (e.g. cybersecurity and analytics offerings).

**Profitability forecast:** With revenue expanding, we expect **EBITDA** and operating profit to rise robustly. We forecast **Operating Income (EBIT)** of about **$4.6 billion** for Q2 2025, up from $4.0 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20%20,Increase%20%2F%20%28Decrease)). This is roughly 15% growth, slightly higher than revenue growth due to operating leverage. Mastercard has been controlling expenses; operating costs grew 12% in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20%20,Increase%20%2F%20%28Decrease)), and management signaled Q2 2025 expense growth around ~10% (excluding deals) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Now%20turning%20to%20the%20second,excluding%20acquisitions%20and%20special%20items)). We assume some margin stability or modest expansion. **EBITDA** is forecast around **$4.85 billion**, adding back depreciation and amortization. (For context, D&A was $216 million in Q1 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000087/ma-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20Revenue%20%20,)) and has likely risen with recent acquisitions, so we include roughly $250 million in D&A for Q2 2025). Mastercard’s business model is asset-light, so EBITDA closely tracks operating income. Our EBITDA forecast implies healthy EBITDA margins in the low 60% range, consistent with historical levels.

**Net income and EPS:** We project **Net Income** of roughly **$3.7 billion** in Q2 2025, about 12% higher than the $3.3 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20%20,19)). The net income growth is a bit lower than EBIT growth, reflecting higher interest costs and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Mastercard’s interest expense has risen with higher debt and rates (management expects about $135 million of net interest/other expense in Q2 ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Acquisitions%20are%20forecasted%20to%20have,primarily%20due%20to%20three%20factors))). Additionally, the effective tax rate in 2025 has ticked up (Q1 2025 was ~18.6% vs ~15–17% in 2024) due in part to global minimum tax changes ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000088/ma03312025-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20%20,15)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000088/ma03312025-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2The%20effective%20tax%20rate%20for,the%20Singapore%20Ministry%20of%20Finance)). Even so, double-digit net income growth is likely. 

**Earnings per Share (EPS)** should grow a bit faster than net income due to continued share buybacks. Mastercard repurchased 23 million shares in 2024 and 4.7 million shares in Q1 2025 alone ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000003/ma12312024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,paid%20%24606%20million%20in%20dividends)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000088/ma03312025-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Return%20of%20Capital%20to%20Shareholders)). This shrink in share count supports EPS growth. We estimate Q2 2025 **EPS** of about **$4.00** per share, up from $3.50 in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000159/ma06302024-exx991xearnings.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20%20,19)). This ~14% EPS increase reflects our net income forecast plus ~2% fewer diluted shares outstanding (the company had ~935 million diluted shares in early 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000087/ma-20240331.htm#:~:text=Basic%20Earnings%20per%20Share%20,956)), and ongoing buybacks likely reduced the count into the 910–920 million range by mid-2025).

**Free cash flow:** Mastercard’s ability to convert earnings to cash is very strong. In 2024, free cash flow reached **$13.6 billion** (a 25% jump from 2023) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MA/mastercard/free-cash-flow#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)), underscoring its high cash generation and moderate capital needs. We expect Q2 2025 **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** around **$3.1–3.2 billion**. This assumes cash from operations grows in line with or slightly below earnings. In the first half of 2024, operating cash flow was tempered by higher customer incentive payments ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000161/ma-20240630.htm#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,by%20higher%20customer%20incentive%20payments)); if such outflows normalize, H1 2025 cash flow should improve. Our Q2 FCF estimate considers net income ~$3.7B plus non-cash charges (depreciation, etc.), minus capital expenditures. Mastercard’s capital spending (on property, equipment, and capitalized software) was $674 million in the first half of 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139124000161/ma-20240630.htm#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%20and%20equipment,44)). We anticipate similar levels in 2025 as Mastercard continues to invest in technology and security, but capex remains relatively small (~5% of revenue). Therefore, free cash flow should closely track profit growth. A ~$3.1B FCF in Q2 would represent an FCF margin of roughly 39% of revenue, consistent with Mastercard’s track record of converting ~40%+ of revenues into free cash flow. 

Overall, Mastercard’s Q2 2025 is expected to show **solid double-digit growth** in revenue and earnings. Strong consumer spending, especially in travel and experiences, and ongoing expansion of digital payment solutions are likely to offset any macroeconomic headwinds ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=and%20cross%20border%20volumes%20also,on%20a%20local%20currency%20basis)) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-mastercard-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-4017285#:~:text=Turning%20now%20to%20Page%2010%2C,weakened%20sentiment%20and%20creates%20risks)). The company’s diversified model (across geographies and products) and disciplined cost management provide confidence in achieving these forecasts. The table below summarizes our projections for Mastercard’s 2025 Q2 financial metrics:

| Company    | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow  | EPS   |
|-----------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Mastercard | 2025 | 2       | 7,980,000,000 | 4,850,000,000 | 4,600,000,000    | 3,700,000,000 | 3,100,000,000   | 4.00  |

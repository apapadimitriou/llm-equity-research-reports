## Humana Inc. (HUM) – 2025 Q2 Forecast

Humana’s second quarter 2025 results are expected to show modest revenue growth with pressure on margins due to a planned reduction in Medicare Advantage membership and persistently high medical costs. In Q2 2024, Humana’s revenue was about $29.54 billion ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-affirms#:~:text=Revenues%20%20,53%2C489)). For Q2 2025, we project revenue to be roughly in the low $30 billions, reflecting only slight growth as the ~10% decline in Medicare Advantage enrollment (about 550,000 members) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=to%20support%20operational%20excellence%20,CenterWell%20strategies%3B%20expected%20to%20drive)) dampens premium revenue. This membership contraction stems from Humana’s strategic exit of certain unprofitable plans and counties ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=to%20support%20operational%20excellence%20,CenterWell%20strategies%3B%20expected%20to%20drive)). However, higher per-member premiums and growth in Humana’s other businesses (Medicaid and the CenterWell healthcare services segment) should partially offset the membership-driven revenue headwind. 

Profitability is expected to improve in Q2 2025 compared to the prior year’s quarter, after adjusting for one-time charges. In Q2 2024, Humana’s GAAP earnings were $5.62 per share ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-affirms#:~:text=,Insurance%20segment%20benefit%20ratio%20of)), which were reduced by special items like “value creation” restructuring costs. With fewer such one-time expenses in 2025, Humana’s underlying operating profit margin should stabilize. Nonetheless, elevated medical utilization has been a challenge (Humana’s benefit expense ratio jumped to 89–90% in mid-2024 from ~86% a year prior) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/humana-forecasts-annual-profit-lower-than-estimates-3861194#:~:text=The%20health%20insurer%2C%20a%20top,for%20the%20last%20few%20quarters)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-affirms#:~:text=,)), and 2025 medical cost ratios are guided to remain high (around 90% for the full year). We therefore anticipate Q2 2025 operating income to remain roughly around $1.0 billion, similar to the year-ago level on an adjusted basis. EBITDA is forecast slightly above that, near $1.2 billion, after adding back approximately $0.2 billion of depreciation and amortization (in line with recent quarters). 

Net income for Q2 2025 is projected at roughly $650 million. This corresponds to an earnings-per-share of about $5.50 for the quarter. This EPS forecast is lower than the $6.96 adjusted EPS of Q2 2024 ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-affirms#:~:text=,Insurance%20segment%20benefit%20ratio%20of)), reflecting the revenue pressures and high medical costs, but it is an improvement on a GAAP basis given the absence of last year’s one-time expenses. It’s also consistent with management’s guidance that Q1 2025 would contribute an outsized portion (60–65%) of full-year earnings ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/humana-forecasts-annual-profit-lower-than-estimates-3861194#:~:text=by%20LSEG)), implying markedly smaller quarterly profits in Q2–Q4. 

Finally, we expect free cash flow (FCF) to strengthen relative to Q1’s seasonal low. Humana’s operating cash flows tend to fluctuate with the timing of Medicare payments and settlements. For example, through the first nine months of 2024, operating cash flow was $3.5 billion versus $11.1 billion in the same period in 2023 ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results--updates-ful.html#:~:text=Operating%20cost%20ratio%20,%244%2C042)), due to differences in payment timing. In Q2 2025, working capital timing should be favorable, leading to an estimated FCF around $0.8–1.0 billion (after roughly $100 million of capital expenditures). This assumes Q2’s operating cash generation normalizes closer to the prior-year’s levels as mid-year government reimbursements and claims settlements balance out.

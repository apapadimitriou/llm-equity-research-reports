# Apple Inc. – 2025 Q2 Financial Forecast

Apple’s **2025 Q2** (April–June 2025 quarter) is expected to show solid year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings. In the year-ago June quarter, Apple reported revenue of $85.8 billion and diluted EPS of $1.40 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20Calif.,11%20percent%20year%20over%20year)). This was driven by relatively flat iPhone sales and strong double-digit growth in Services ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=1%3A41%20pm%3A%20iPad%20%20revenue,year%20revenue%20decline%2C%20dropping%204.9)). For **2025 Q2**, management has indicated **“low to mid single digits”** revenue growth year-over-year ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=Color%20at%20the%20total%20company,Tax%20rate%20around%2016)). We therefore project roughly **5%–6%** higher sales, around **$90–91 billion** in revenue for the quarter. This growth will likely be supported by modestly higher iPhone revenue (with the introduction of the *iPhone 16e* mid-cycle) and continued double-digit expansion in Services, partly offset by slight declines in Wearables ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=1%3A41%20pm%3A%20iPad%20%20revenue,year%20revenue%20decline%2C%20dropping%204.9)). 

Profitability should improve slightly **year-over-year**. Apple guided gross margin for the quarter around **45.5%–46.5%** and operating expenses near **$15.4 billion** ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=Color%20at%20the%20total%20company,Tax%20rate%20around%2016)). Given a similar expense run-rate to last year, we expect operating income on the order of **$26 billion**, up just a bit from the prior June quarter (~$25.35 billion operating profit in 2024) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%20,%24)). Assuming a ~16% effective tax rate (in line with guidance ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=Color%20at%20the%20total%20company,Tax%20rate%20around%2016))), that yields an estimated **net income** of about **$22–23 billion** (versus $21.45 billion a year ago ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=Provision%20for%20income%20taxes%20,4.67))). Notably, **EPS** is projected to climb more than net income, aided by Apple’s aggressive buybacks – the company authorized an additional **$100 billion** repurchase program in April 2025 ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/my/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)). We forecast diluted **EPS around $1.50–$1.55** (approx. **$1.52** midpoint), representing high single-digit growth from last year’s $1.40 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,4.67)). 

Apple’s cash generation remains very strong. In the June 2024 quarter, Apple produced *“nearly $29 billion in operating cash flow”* ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20the%20quarter%2C%20our%20record,%E2%80%9D)). Given capital expenditures of roughly ~$2 billion per quarter (Apple spent $6.5 billion on capex in the first nine months of FY2024) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=Payments%20for%20acquisition%20of%20property%2C,1%2C311)), last year’s free cash flow for Q2 was around **$27 billion**. We anticipate a similarly robust **free cash flow** in the *high-$20 billions* for **2025 Q2**, as healthy earnings and working-capital dynamics (e.g. manufacturing build-ahead benefits ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=benefits%20to%20the%20June%20quarter,the%20impact%20be%20without%20them))) drive strong cash generation. The table below summarizes our forecasts for Apple’s 2025-Q2 financial metrics:

| Company    | Year | Quarter | Revenue          | EBITDA           | Operating Income   | Net Income        | Free Cash Flow     | EPS   |
|-----------|------|---------|------------------:|-----------------:|-------------------:|------------------:|-------------------:|------:|
| Apple Inc. | 2025 | 2       | 90,500,000,000    | 29,200,000,000   | 26,300,000,000     | 22,500,000,000    | 28,000,000,000     | 1.52  |

**Forecast Highlights:** We expect Apple to post approximately **$90.5 billion** in revenue for Q2 2025, about a 5% increase year-on-year ([www.macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/#:~:text=Color%20at%20the%20total%20company,Tax%20rate%20around%2016)). **EBITDA** is projected near **$29.2 billion**, with operating profit around **$26.3 billion** reflecting stable margins and slightly higher expenses. **Net income** of roughly **$22.5 billion** and **EPS of about $1.52** are forecast – an EPS rise of ~8% over the prior year, aided by continued share repurchases ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/my/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)). Finally, we project **free cash flow** on the order of **$28 billion**, in line with the strong cash generation Apple achieved in the year-ago quarter ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDuring%20the%20quarter%2C%20our%20record,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240801799244/en/#:~:text=Payments%20for%20acquisition%20of%20property%2C,1%2C311)).

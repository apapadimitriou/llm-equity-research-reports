# UnitedHealth Group (UNH) – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

**Recent Performance and Outlook:** UnitedHealth Group’s second quarter of 2024 saw revenues of about $98.9 billion, reflecting ~6% year-over-year growth, although results were impacted by one-time items ([www.unitedhealthgroup.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-07-16-uhg-reports-second-quarter-results.html#:~:text=,Over%20Year%2C%20Led%20by%20Optum)). GAAP EPS for Q2 2024 was $4.54 due to charges (cybersecurity costs and a divestiture), whereas adjusted EPS was $6.80 ([www.unitedhealthgroup.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-07-16-uhg-reports-second-quarter-results.html#:~:text=,5x%20Net%20Income)). By contrast, Q1 2025 showed a strong rebound – revenues grew 9.8% year-over-year to $109.6 billion ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=The%20company%20generated%20revenues%20of,from%20the%20prior%20year)) – and the company earned $6.4 billion net income (EPS $6.85) in that quarter ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=The%20US,9bn%20a%20year%20earlier)). However, UnitedHealth revised its full-year 2025 guidance downward after Q1, citing *“heightened care activity”* in Medicare Advantage and other cost pressures ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=closed%2C%20the%20company%20said)). Management trimmed the 2025 net earnings outlook to $24.65–$25.15 per share (from an initial ~$28.40 midpoint) ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=Besides%2C%20the%20group%20has%20now,trimmed%20its%202025%20performance%20projections)), implying that profit margins will be under pressure in upcoming quarters. This context informs our Q2 2025 forecasts below.

**Revenue:** We project Q2 2025 revenue of roughly **\$111 billion**, up about 12% year-over-year. This growth is driven by robust expansion in people served across UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In the first quarter of 2025, UnitedHealthcare’s membership grew by 780,000, fueling a $9.3 billion year-over-year increase in UHC segment revenues ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=Learn%20more%20about%20Strategic%20Intelligence)). Optum’s services also continue to expand (Optum revenues were up $2.8 billion in Q1) ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=Learn%20more%20about%20Strategic%20Intelligence)). UnitedHealth’s own 2025 outlook anticipated ~$450–455 billion in full-year revenue (about 12% growth) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116305758/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-2024-Results#:~:text=2024%2C%20including%20revenues%20of%20%24450,32%20billion%20to%20%2433%20billion)), and Q2 will reflect this trajectory. Additionally, the prior year’s Q2 included some lost revenue from a cyberattack disruption, an impact that won’t repeat in 2025. With these factors, double-digit growth led by both insurance premiums and health services is expected.

**EBITDA & Operating Income:** We forecast **EBITDA of around \$10 billion** and **Operating Income around \$8.5 billion** for Q2 2025. This represents an improvement from the reported $7.9 billion **“earnings from operations”** in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240716029443/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Revenues%20%20,%7C%205.8)) (which had been depressed by ~$1.1 billion in one-time cyberattack costs ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240716029443/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=,Healthcare%20business%20disruption%20impacts%20and))). Absent last year’s charges, underlying operating profit is set to rise with higher revenue. However, we temper our margin expectations due to elevated medical cost trends in 2025. UnitedHealth noted that its medical care ratio climbed to 85.5% in 2024 (vs. 83.2% in 2023) amid Medicare funding cuts and higher utilization ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116305758/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-2024-Results#:~:text=cyberattack%20direct%20response%20costs%20and,company%20did%20not%20have%20any)). Those cost pressures persisted into early 2025 – the company acknowledged **“higher-than-expected care activity”** that weighed on Q1’s Medicare Advantage profitability ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=closed%2C%20the%20company%20said)). Accordingly, we assume Q2 2025 operating margin will be slightly lower than a normalized year-ago margin. The ~$8.5 billion operating profit forecast implies an operating margin in the mid-7% range on our revenue estimate, down from ~8.8% on an adjusted basis in Q2 2024, reflecting the ongoing pressure from medical costs. EBITDA is expected to rise in tandem (adding back roughly $1 billion of depreciation/amortization), reaching about $9.5–$10 billion.

**Net Income & EPS:** For Q2 2025 we estimate **Net Income of about \$5.5 billion**, equivalent to **EPS of roughly \$5.90** (diluted). This would be a significant rebound from the unusually low $4.2 billion net income in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240716029443/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=%28393%29%20%20,%244%2C216)), which had included non-cash losses on the sale of a business in South America and other one-time charges. Excluding those charges, the year-ago quarter’s underlying earnings were around $6.3 billion (adjusted EPS $6.80) ([www.unitedhealthgroup.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-07-16-uhg-reports-second-quarter-results.html#:~:text=,5x%20Net%20Income)). Our Q2 2025 profit forecast is a bit below that normalized 2024 level, consistent with the company’s reduced earnings outlook for 2025 ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=Besides%2C%20the%20group%20has%20now,trimmed%20its%202025%20performance%20projections)). Higher medical utilization and reimbursement pressures are constraining net margin this year, so we expect Q2 net margin to be on the order of ~5%, down from the ~5.9% net margin seen in Q2 2023 (before the one-offs) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240716029443/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Revenues%20%20,%7C%205.8)). Still, at ~$5.5 billion, Q2 2025 net income would be in line with the long-term growth trend when excluding last year’s special items. Our EPS estimate of about $5.9 is below Q1 2025’s $6.85 result ([www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com](https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/news/unitedhealth-profit-q1-2025/#:~:text=The%20US,9bn%20a%20year%20earlier)), reflecting the anticipated margin squeeze, but well above the GAAP EPS of $4.54 in Q2 2024 ([www.unitedhealthgroup.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-07-16-uhg-reports-second-quarter-results.html#:~:text=,5x%20Net%20Income)). This level also aligns with management’s post-Q1 guidance revision, which implied relatively flat year-over-year adjusted earnings in the first half before improvement later in the year.

**Free Cash Flow:** We expect **Free Cash Flow (FCF) around \$5.5 billion** for Q2 2025. UnitedHealth consistently generates robust cash flows from operations, supported by its growing revenue base and efficient working capital management. In Q2 2024, operating cash flow was $6.7 billion – roughly **1.5× net income** that quarter ([www.unitedhealthgroup.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-07-16-uhg-reports-second-quarter-results.html#:~:text=,3%C2%A0Million%20Year%20to%20Date)) – due to temporary factors like the timing of claim payments and the add-back of non-cash charges. For 2025, with fewer one-time distortions, we project operating cash flow to track closer to net income. Our Q2 FCF estimate assumes cash from operations in the mid-$6 billion range, partly offset by about $1 billion in capital expenditures and technology investments (consistent with recent quarters). Notably, management’s full-year 2025 cash flow from operations target was $32–33 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116305758/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Reports-2024-Results#:~:text=2024%2C%20including%20revenues%20of%20%24450,32%20billion%20to%20%2433%20billion)), indicating confidence in strong cash generation despite earnings headwinds. A Q2 FCF of ~$5.5 billion would demonstrate healthy liquidity and the company’s continued ability to fund dividends and share buybacks while investing in growth.

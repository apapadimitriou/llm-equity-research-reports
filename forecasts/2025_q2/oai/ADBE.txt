# Adobe Inc. (ADBE) – Q2 2025 Forecast

## Revenue and Demand Drivers  
Adobe’s **Q2 2025** revenue is projected to be approximately **$5.87 billion**, representing about **10–11%** growth year-over-year. This strong increase is supported by recovering demand for Adobe’s software and new AI-driven features ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-adoption-ai-powered-tools-2025-06-12/#:~:text=fueled%20by%20the%20ongoing%20adoption,60%20billion%2C%20up%20from%20its)). The company had guided Q2 revenue in the range of **$5.77–$5.82 billion** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-beats-first-quarter-revenue-estimates-2025-03-12/#:~:text=Adobe%20forecasted%20second,investors%20are%20concerned%20about%20the)), and our estimate is at the high end of that range. Robust interest in Adobe’s AI-powered creative tools (such as the **Firefly** generative AI feature) and improved macroeconomic conditions have bolstered sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-adoption-ai-powered-tools-2025-06-12/#:~:text=Adobe%20has%20raised%20its%20full,attributes%20this%20positive%20momentum%20to)). This growth follows a solid Q1, where revenue grew ~10% YoY to $5.71 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-beats-first-quarter-revenue-estimates-2025-03-12/#:~:text=for%20AI%20and%20add,97%20per%20share)), indicating that Adobe’s momentum is carrying into Q2. We expect **Digital Media** (Creative Cloud, Document Cloud) to remain the largest contributor, with that segment likely growing around 11% YoY (similar to Q1) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Digital%20Media%20segment%20revenue%20was,year%20growth)), while **Digital Experience** (marketing and analytics) grows near 10% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L65%20%E2%80%A2Digital%20Experience,year)). Overall, the revenue uptick signals healthy demand across Adobe’s subscription offerings as customers adopt the new AI-enhanced capabilities.

## Operating Profit and EBITDA  
We anticipate Adobe will maintain strong profitability in Q2. **Operating Income** is forecast around **$2.11 billion**, up slightly from about $1.89 billion in the year-ago quarter ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20in%20the,17%20billion)). This implies an operating margin of roughly **36%**, which is fairly stable year-over-year. Adobe’s ongoing investments in R&D and AI integration are largely offset by revenue scale and cost discipline, resulting in *modest margin expansion*. For example, Q2 operating profit growth (~12% YoY) is just above revenue growth, reflecting a small efficiency gain. Adding back depreciation and amortization (approximately **$0.21 billion** in Q2 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20in%20the,17%20billion)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,214))) to operating income, we forecast **EBITDA** of roughly **$2.32 billion** for the quarter. This corresponds to an EBITDA margin near 39–40%, essentially on par with last year’s level. In summary, Adobe’s high gross margins from its software subscription model and prudent expense management are expected to keep profitability strong in Q2 despite continued investments.

## Net Income and EPS  
**Net Income** for Q2 2025 is projected at approximately **$1.69 billion**, a mid-single-digit increase from about $1.57 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20in%20the,17%20billion)). Net profit is growing slightly slower than operating profit, which could be due to higher interest expenses or a normalized tax rate this quarter. Even so, Adobe’s aggressive share repurchase program is amplifying growth on a per-share basis. The company authorized a **$25 billion stock buyback** in 2023 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-forecasts-downbeat-second-quarter-revenue-2024-03-14/#:~:text=announcement,with%20increased%20competition%20from%20startups)) and has been steadily repurchasing shares. As a result, the diluted share count has fallen (from roughly 451 million a year ago to an estimated 429 million in Q2 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Diluted%20net%20income%20per%20share,454))). This boosts the **EPS (Earnings Per Share)** growth above net income growth. We forecast **EPS** of about **$3.94** for Q2, which is roughly **13%** higher year-over-year (GAAP diluted EPS was $3.49 in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Diluted%20net%20income%20per%20share,454))). The double-digit EPS increase reflects Adobe’s solid net income growth plus the accretive effect of share buybacks. It’s worth noting that Adobe also reports **non-GAAP (adjusted) EPS**, which excludes certain expenses like stock-based compensation; that metric is even higher (for instance, Q1 adjusted EPS was $5.08 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-beats-first-quarter-revenue-estimates-2025-03-12/#:~:text=quarter.%20Adobe%20reported%20first,97%20per%20share))). However, our $3.94 EPS forecast here corresponds to GAAP earnings, providing a consistent basis with other GAAP figures.

## Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow  
Adobe’s business produces robust cash flows, and Q2 is no exception. We estimate **Operating Cash Flow** on the order of **$2.19 billion** for Q2 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L51%20%E2%80%A2Cash%20flows,19%20billion)), reflecting the company’s high profitability and upfront subscription billings. Adobe’s **free cash flow** should track close to this level because capital expenditure needs are very low. In Q2 the company likely spent under **$50 million** on property and equipment ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%20and%20equipment,111)), so we project **Free Cash Flow** around **$2.14 billion** for the quarter (operating cash flow minus capex). This implies Adobe converts over **125%** of its net income into free cash (helped by some customers paying annually in advance, which boosts short-term cash inflows). Such strong free cash flow highlights the efficiency of Adobe’s SaaS model and provides ample capital for shareholder returns and growth investments. The company can comfortably continue funding its big stock buybacks and strategic R&D (including AI initiatives) through these internally generated funds.

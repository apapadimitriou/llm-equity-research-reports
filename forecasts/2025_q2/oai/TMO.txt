## Thermo Fisher Scientific – 2025 Q2 Forecast (Analyst Projection as of 2025-07-09)

Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) entered mid-2025 with stable but modest growth, following a flat revenue trend in early 2024 and a slight uptick in Q1 2025. The life-science tools industry is seeing **gradual improvement in demand** as biotech funding conditions recover ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,07)). In 2024, Thermo Fisher’s Q2 revenue had declined 1% year-over-year to $10.54 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%202024)), but the company noted **“improved demand”** for its clinical trial services by mid-2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,07)). With this backdrop, we expect **Thermo Fisher’s Q2 2025 results to show a return to modest growth and strong profitability.** Key assumptions and forecasts for Q2 2025 are outlined below:

- **Revenue:** Forecast at **$10.8 billion** (approx.), reflecting a small year-over-year increase (~2–3%). This is based on steady demand across Thermo Fisher’s segments and a recovering biotech funding environment ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,07)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=per%20share%2C%20slightly%20lower%20than,laboratory%20and%20biopharma%20services%20segment)). In Q1 2025 the company already delivered $10.36 billion in sales (slightly above expectations) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-beats-estimates-steady-demand-tools-services-used-clinical-2025-04-23/#:~:text=with%20total%20revenue%20reaching%20%2410,CEO%20Marc%20Casper%20highlighted%20strong)), growing ~0.2% organically ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20Scientific%20reported%20minimal,cash%20related%20to%20changes%20in)). We assume Q2 will see a bit stronger growth as **public funding for early-stage biotechs improves** and recent product launches (e.g. analytical instruments) contribute to sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,07)).

- **EBITDA:** Projected around **$2.75 billion**, maintaining an EBITDA margin in the mid-20s (%). Thermo Fisher’s trailing EBITDA margin has been stable (~24% of sales) through 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TMO/thermo-fisher-scientific/ebitda-margin#:~:text=Date%20%20,23.95)). We anticipate similar margins in Q2 2025, supported by the company’s productivity and cost management initiatives (such as its PPI business system). In Q1, Thermo Fisher achieved slight organic growth while **“strong productivity gains offset margin pressures,”** indicating efficient cost control ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=%2A%20Achieved%201,capital%20deployment%20via%20share%20buybacks)). This suggests EBITDA will keep pace with the modest revenue growth.

- **Operating Income:** Forecast at **$1.88 billion** for Q2 2025. This represents a **high-teens operating margin**, roughly in line with the 17.3% GAAP operating margin achieved in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20in%20the,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)). Last year’s Q2 saw GAAP operating income of $1.82 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20in%20the,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)) (which was a 15% jump from the prior year, thanks to cost efficiencies and lower one-time expenses). We assume Thermo Fisher will sustain similar operating profitability in Q2 2025, with incremental improvement from ongoing cost initiatives. Any increased amortization from recent acquisitions (e.g. Olink in late 2024) is expected to be offset by efficiency gains and higher volume.

- **Net Income:** Forecast at **$1.60 billion** for Q2 2025. This projection is slightly above the prior-year Q2 net income (~$1.55 billion, based on $4.04 GAAP EPS and ~383 million shares ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=GAAP%20Earnings%20Results)) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20shares%3A%20%20,))). The modest uptick in operating profit is partly offset by higher interest expenses (Thermo Fisher’s debt increased in early 2025 ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=cash%20flow%20reduction%20partly%20to,prior%20year%2C%20reflecting%20ongoing%20operational))). However, the **effective tax rate** remains favorable and share repurchases provide a boost. Notably, the company bought back $4.6 billion of stock in 2024 and an additional **$2 billion in Q1 2025**, reducing the share count ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,through%20stock%20buybacks%20and%20dividends)) ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=billion%20during%20the%20quarter%2C%20reaching,year%2C%20reflecting%20ongoing%20operational%20adjustments)). This enhances per-share earnings even if net profit growth is modest.

- **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Forecast at **$1.6 billion** for Q2 2025. In the year-ago quarter, Thermo Fisher generated $1.674 billion of free cash flow ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Reconciliation%20of%20free%20cash%20flow,)), benefiting from strong operating cash flows. We expect slightly lower FCF year-over-year due to working capital movements in early 2025. **Q1 2025 saw a significant $1.2 billion use of cash for working capital**, which caused free cash flow to drop to just $373 million (59% below Q1 2024) ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=representing%201,cash%20related%20to%20changes%20in)). Some of that invested working capital should unwind in Q2, boosting cash flow, but not fully back to last year’s level. Consequently, we anticipate healthy Q2 operating cash generation with capex roughly steady, yielding about $1.6 billion FCF (a strong result, albeit a bit below Q2 2024).

- **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Forecast **$4.20** (GAAP diluted EPS). This would slightly exceed the $4.04 GAAP EPS reported in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=GAAP%20Earnings%20Results)), mainly due to the combination of marginally higher net income and a lower share count from buybacks. Thermo Fisher’s adjusted EPS in Q2 2024 was $5.37 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Non)); we expect the adjusted figure for Q2 2025 to remain in that mid-$5 range as core operating performance is stable. Our $4.20 GAAP EPS estimate reflects the after-tax profitability with all charges included. It assumes the company continues to manage costs well and sees no major one-time charges beyond normal amortization. The ongoing share repurchases are a tailwind for EPS growth, as noted with the significant buybacks earlier in the year ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=billion%20during%20the%20quarter%2C%20reaching,year%2C%20reflecting%20ongoing%20operational%20adjustments)).

The table below summarizes our projections for Thermo Fisher’s 2025 Q2 financial metrics:

| Company                 | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA       | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|-------------------------|------|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| Thermo Fisher Scientific | 2025 | 2       | 10,800,000,000 | 2,750,000,000 | 1,880,000,000    | 1,600,000,000 | 1,600,000,000  | 4.20 |

For example, Q2 2024 revenue was $10.54 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=per%20share%2C%20slightly%20lower%20than,laboratory%20and%20biopharma%20services%20segment)) and free cash flow $1.674 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240723465896/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results#:~:text=Reconciliation%20of%20free%20cash%20flow,)). Recent trends such as Q1 2025 revenue of $10.36 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-beats-estimates-steady-demand-tools-services-used-clinical-2025-04-23/#:~:text=with%20total%20revenue%20reaching%20%2410,CEO%20Marc%20Casper%20highlighted%20strong)) (1% organic growth ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20Scientific%20reported%20minimal,cash%20related%20to%20changes%20in))) and the drop in Q1 free cash flow ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=representing%201,cash%20related%20to%20changes%20in)) inform our assumptions. Industry conditions (e.g. improving biotech funding and demand for TMO’s tools) are noted in news reports ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/thermo-fisher-lifts-profit-forecast-biotech-demand-shows-signs-improvement-2024-07-24/#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20raised%20its%20annual,07)).

## CrowdStrike (CRWD) – Q2 2025 Forecast

CrowdStrike provided guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2026 (which we label as 2025 Q2) with revenue in the range of $1.145–$1.152 billion ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)). This represents about 19% year-over-year growth from the $963.9 million revenue in the same quarter last year ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Fiscal%202025%20Financial,Highlights)). We forecast revenue at the high end of guidance (~$1.155 billion) given CrowdStrike’s history of modest outperformance. GAAP profitability is expected to remain under pressure due to heavy stock-based compensation and a one-time restructuring charge (layoff of ~5% of staff) of roughly $30–$45 million ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/crowdstrike-lay-off-5-staff-reaffirms-forecasts-2025-05-07/#:~:text=off%20approximately%20500%20employees%2C%20representing,revenue%20is%20forecasted%20to%20be)). Consequently, we project a GAAP operating loss around $80 million and a net loss around $60 million, partly offset by substantial interest income (the company earned ~$45 million interest in Q1 FY26) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535527/000153552725000019/crwd-20250430.htm#:~:text=Interest%20income%20%20,7%2C667)). Free cash flow is forecast to be approximately $240 million – slightly below the $272 million in the year-ago quarter ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=million%20in%20the%20second%20quarter,second%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024)) – as management noted a ~$29 million adverse impact on Q2 cash flow from the prior year’s outage-related costs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-06-03/#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20first,1%20billion%20share%20repurchase%20program)).

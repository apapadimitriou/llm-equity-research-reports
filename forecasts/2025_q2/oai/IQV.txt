# IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV) – Q2 2025 Forecast

IQVIA Holdings Inc. is a leading provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services for the life sciences industry. In the first quarter of 2025, IQVIA achieved revenue of $3.829 billion, up 2.5% year-over-year, with strength in its Technology & Analytics Solutions (TAS) segment (up 6.4% YoY) offsetting slower growth in Research & Development Solutions (R&DS) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20first%20quarter,1%20percent%20at%20constant%20currency)) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=IQVIA%E2%80%99s%20performance%20varied%20significantly%20across,at%20constant%20currency)). For the second quarter of 2025, we expect IQVIA’s revenue growth to accelerate modestly, supported by a robust backlog and favorable currency tailwinds. At the end of Q1 2025, IQVIA’s contracted backlog reached $31.5 billion (up 4.8% YoY) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=R%26D%20Solutions%20Backlog%20and%20Future,Outlook)), which provides visibility into future R&DS revenues. The company also raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance on May 6, 2025, citing favorable foreign exchange rates ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=To%20reflect%20the%20favorable%20change,10)). Management guided Q2 2025 revenue to **$3.93–$4.00 billion**, implying roughly 3–5% growth year-over-year ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=The%20full,in%20the%20following%20slide)). We project Q2 revenue at the upper end of this range, reflecting improving demand in the TAS segment and contribution from recent acquisitions (which management noted add ~1.5% to growth) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,2.83)). This yields an estimated **Revenue of ~$3.98 billion** for Q2 2025, about 4–5% higher than the $3.814 billion reported in Q2 2024 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=,64)).

**EBITDA and Operating Income:** IQVIA’s adjusted EBITDA margin was about 23% in Q2 2024 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=,64)). For Q2 2025, the company forecasts adjusted EBITDA between $895–$915 million ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=The%20full,in%20the%20following%20slide)). We anticipate **EBITDA of approximately $910 million**, near the high end of guidance, assuming a slight margin expansion from cost efficiencies. IQVIA’s full-year outlook calls for up to 20 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in 2025 ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/IQVIA-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results-Reaffirms-Full-Year-2025-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=million%2C%20up%2041%20percent%20year,10)), and we expect some of this to be realized in Q2. On a GAAP basis, operating income in Q2 2024 was $520 million ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,995)), which included roughly $28 million in restructuring costs. With higher revenue and relatively flat operating expenses (IQVIA held SG&A steady year-over-year in Q1 2025 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Cost%20of%20revenues%2C%20exclusive%20of,))), we forecast a **Q2 2025 Operating Income around $530 million**. This slight uptick in operating profit reflects stable operating margins alongside the modest revenue growth.

**Net Income and EPS:** We project **GAAP Net Income of roughly $270 million** for Q2 2025, lower than the $363 million achieved in Q2 2024 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=Income%20before%20income%20taxes%20and,152)). The year-over-year decline is mainly because last year’s Q2 benefited from a one-time non-operating gain of about $67 million (recorded in “Other income, net”) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=Other%20income%2C%20net%20%20,152)), an item not likely to recur. Aside from this, core net profit is expected to be relatively stable, as interest expense remains around prior levels (IQVIA’s debt was largely unchanged) and the effective tax rate is consistent. IQVIA has been aggressively repurchasing shares (e.g. $425 million bought back in Q1 2025) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,million%20to%20reflect%20more%20favorable)), which reduces the share count and cushions the impact of lower net income on **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**. With a significantly lower diluted share count in 2025 (about 177 million in Q1 2025, down from 186 million a year prior) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,184.3)), we expect **GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $1.55** for Q2 2025. This represents a decline from the $1.97 GAAP EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=,64)), but the drop in EPS is smaller in percentage terms than the drop in net income due to the share buybacks.

**Free Cash Flow:** IQVIA’s cash generation has been a strong point. In full-year 2024, free cash flow (FCF) reached $2.114 billion, a 41% increase over 2023 ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/IQVIA-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results-Reaffirms-Full-Year-2025-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%2C885%20million%20and%20Adjusted%20Diluted)), thanks to improved working capital management and growing earnings. In Q2 2024, FCF was $445 million ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2024/07/iqvia-reports-second-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=match%20at%20L78%20Operating%20Cash,Cash%20Flow%20was%20%24445%20million)), following an exceptionally strong Q1–Q2 performance that year. For Q2 2025, we anticipate FCF will remain robust, supported by higher operating cash flow from earnings and stable capital expenditures. In Q1 2025, FCF was $426 million (up 13% YoY) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/iqvia-q1-2025-slides-revenue-up-25-adjusted-eps-beats-expectations-4025385#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20improved%20significantly,into%20cash%20despite%20macroeconomic%20challenges)), and management has indicated a target of ~90% free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,425%20million%20of%20common%20stock)). Given these trends, we forecast **Free Cash Flow of about $480 million** for Q2 2025. This slight increase over the prior-year quarter reflects continued strong cash conversion and possibly some timing benefits in collections, albeit growth is moderating after the outsized improvements seen in 2024.

The table below summarizes our projections for IQVIA’s 2025 Q2 financial metrics:

| Company              | Year | Quarter | Revenue           | EBITDA           | Operating Income  | Net Income       | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|----------------------|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| IQVIA Holdings Inc.  | 2025 | 2       | 3,980,000,000     | 910,000,000      | 530,000,000       | 270,000,000      | 480,000,000      | 1.55  |

**Analysis Summary:** Our Q2 2025 forecast anticipates modest top-line growth for IQVIA driven by its analytics segment and a large backlog of clinical development work, with revenue near $4.0 billion. Profitability (EBITDA and operating income) should improve slightly in absolute terms, though GAAP net income is expected to be lower than last year’s Q2 due to the absence of one-off gains. Nevertheless, ongoing share repurchases help support the EPS, which we estimate at $1.55 for the quarter. Free cash flow is projected to stay strong at roughly $480 million, underscoring IQVIA’s excellent cash generation and providing flexibility for continued share buybacks and debt reduction ([ir.iqvia.com](https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/IQVIA-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results-Reaffirms-Full-Year-2025-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=percent%20year,15%2C725%20million%20to%20%2416%2C125%20million)) ([www.iqvia.com](https://www.iqvia.com/newsroom/2025/05/iqvia-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,exchange%20rates%3B%20reaffirmed%20profit%20guidance)). These forecasts are consistent with IQVIA’s own guidance and recent trends, and they reflect an overall expectation of steady growth and operational execution in Q2 2025.

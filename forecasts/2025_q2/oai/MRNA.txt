# Moderna (MRNA) – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Recent Performance & Guidance  
Moderna’s revenue has sharply declined from pandemic highs as COVID-19 vaccine demand shifts to a seasonal model. In Q1 2025, Moderna reported revenue of only **$108 million** (down 35% year-over-year) and a GAAP net loss of about **$1.0 billion** ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20Total%20revenue%20for%20the,rates%20compared%20to%20the%20same)). Management reiterated a full-year 2025 revenue outlook of **$1.5–2.5 billion**, noting that only approximately **$0.2 billion** would come in the **first half of 2025** due to seasonal demand concentrating in later quarters ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20The%20Company%20reiterates%202025,seasonality%20of%20its%20respiratory%20business)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=by%20lower%20net%20product%20sales%2C,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)). For context, in Q2 2024 Moderna had **$241 million** revenue with a $1.3 billion net loss (EPS –$3.33) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Reports%20second%20quarter%20revenues%20of,33)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Net%20Loss%20Per%20Share%3A%20Net,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)), reflecting higher product sales during the tail end of the pandemic demand and significant fixed costs. By contrast, 2025’s second quarter is expected to be much softer on sales but also benefits from cost-cutting measures.

Moderna has aggressively reduced operating expenses in response to lower revenue. In Q1 2025, R&D spending was cut **19%** year-over-year (to $856 million) and SG&A by **23%** (to $212 million) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Research%20and%20Development%20Expenses%3A%20Research,intismeran%20autogene%2C%20and%20norovirus%20programs)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Selling%2C%20General%20and%20Administrative%20Expenses%3A,operations%20and%20prioritize%20cost%20management)). Despite these reductions, fixed costs like manufacturing overhead and ongoing R&D for Moderna’s pipeline remain high relative to current sales. In Q1 2025, cost of sales actually exceeded product revenue (104% of net product sales) due to inventory write-downs and underutilized capacity ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Cost%20of%20Sales%3A%20Cost%20of,reflecting%20the%20impact%20of%20lower)). This dynamic is likely to persist in Q2 given minimal vaccine shipments in the summer months, meaning **gross margin will be near zero or negative**. However, Moderna’s hefty cash position (over $8 billion at Q1’s end ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-modernas-q1-2025-results-surprise-with-narrower-loss-93CH-3685852#:~:text=Earnings%20call%20transcript%3A%20Moderna%27s%20Q1,better%20than%20the%20forecast%20of))) generates interest income that partly offsets operating losses – about $90 million in interest income in Q1 2025 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Total%20operating%20expenses%20%20,)). There is no indication of substantial one-time gains or tax benefits in Q2 (the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=continues%20to%20streamline%20operations%20and,prioritize%20cost%20management)). Taken together, Moderna is poised for another large quarterly loss in Q2 2025, albeit somewhat **narrower than the $1.3 billion loss a year prior**, thanks to cost cuts and lower write-downs.

Moderna’s **free cash flow** is expected to remain deeply negative in Q2 2025 as the company funds its pipeline and prepares for a bigger second-half vaccine rollout. In Q1, Moderna used **$1.04 billion** in operating cash (similar to its net loss) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=match%20at%20L362%20Operating%20lease,)), and spent about **$117 million** on capital expenditures ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%2C%20plant%20and,)). Q2 will likely see a similar **>$1 billion operating cash outflow**, potentially even higher if the company builds inventory for fall vaccination campaigns (cash outlay for production that won’t be recorded as revenue until Q3/Q4). Capital spending is expected to be in line with Q1 levels as Moderna has scaled back expansion plans. Overall, we project **free cash flow around –$1.2 billion** for Q2. This ongoing cash burn will reduce Moderna’s cash reserves toward the ~$6 billion level the company predicted for 2025 year-end ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Reports%20first%20quarter%20revenues%20of,52)).

## Q2 2025 Forecast – Key Metrics  
Using the above assumptions and guidance, we forecast the following for **Moderna’s Q2 2025** financial metrics:

- **Revenue:** Approximately **$90–100 million**. This aligns with Moderna’s guidance of ~$0.2 billion total in H1 2025 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20The%20Company%20reiterates%202025,seasonality%20of%20its%20respiratory%20business)) (implying Q2 contributes roughly $90 million, given Q1’s $108 million). We assume limited COVID-19 vaccine sales in Q2 and negligible new product revenue, as major vaccine shipments (COVID booster, RSV) will occur in the fall ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=by%20lower%20net%20product%20sales%2C,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)).  
- **EBITDA:** Around **–$1.05 billion**. With negligible gross profit and operating expenses still above $1 billion, we expect a significant EBITDA loss. This is moderately better than Q2 2024’s EBITDA (approximately –$1.3 billion) due to reduced R&D and SG&A costs ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Research%20and%20Development%20Expenses%3A%20Research,intismeran%20autogene%2C%20and%20norovirus%20programs)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Selling%2C%20General%20and%20Administrative%20Expenses%3A,operations%20and%20prioritize%20cost%20management)). EBITDA is calculated by adding back ~$40 million of depreciation to operating loss (depreciation in Q1 was $39 million) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,3)).  
- **Operating Income:** Around **–$1.1 billion** (a $1.1 billion operating loss). Low sales and still-substantial R&D investment (we project ~$0.9–1.0 billion in R&D for Q2) will keep Moderna in an operating loss position. This projected loss is slightly smaller than the $1.36 billion operating loss in Q2 2024  ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Loss%20from%20operations%20%20,)), reflecting cost-cutting and fewer inventory charges.  
- **Net Income:** Approximately **–$1.0 billion**. After factoring in roughly $80–90 million of interest income on cash investments ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Total%20operating%20expenses%20%20,)) and minimal tax expense, Moderna’s net loss should be about $1 billion for the quarter. This is improved versus the $1.3 billion net loss in Q2 last year ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Reports%20second%20quarter%20revenues%20of,33)) thanks to lower costs, but still a sizeable loss.  
- **Free Cash Flow:** Approximately **–$1.2 billion**. We expect Q2 operating cash outflow on the order of $1.1 billion (similar to the net loss, plus potential working capital uses for inventory). Subtracting an estimated ~$100 million in capital expenditures ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%2C%20plant%20and,)) yields roughly –$1.2 billion free cash flow for the quarter. This continued cash burn is consistent with Q1 and reflects ongoing operational losses and pipeline investments.  
- **EPS:** Approximately **–$2.7** (loss per share). This is based on the forecast ~$1.0 billion net loss divided by ~385 million shares outstanding. It represents an improvement from the –$3.33 EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Net%20Loss%20Per%20Share%3A%20Net,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)), in line with the slightly lower net loss year-over-year. (We note that actual EPS will depend on the final share count; Moderna’s share count has been around 384–385 million in recent quarters ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,)).)

The table below summarizes our projections for Moderna’s **Q2 2025**:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow    | EPS    |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Moderna | 2025 | 2       | 95,000,000    | -1,050,000,000 | -1,100,000,000   | -1,000,000,000 | -1,200,000,000   | -2.70  |

All figures above are **forecasts** for the quarter ending June 30, 2025. They are expressed in absolute dollars (not in millions) and assume USD as the currency. These projections are based on publicly available data up to July 18, 2025, including Moderna’s reported financials and management’s guidance ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20The%20Company%20reiterates%202025,seasonality%20of%20its%20respiratory%20business)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/moderna-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates#:~:text=by%20lower%20net%20product%20sales%2C,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)), but they remain subject to variability. Actual results may differ due to factors like vaccine uptake, cost timing, or any partnership revenues not reflected in current guidance. The forecast provides a reasonable expectation of **continued losses in Q2 2025** for Moderna, with the anticipation of a rebound in the second half of 2025 when new booster shots and other products drive higher revenue.

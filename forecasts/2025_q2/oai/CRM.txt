# Salesforce (CRM) – Q2 2025 Forecast

## Revenue Outlook (Q2 2025)  
 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=,GAAP%20Operating%20Margin%20of%2033.7)) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,8%25%20in%20CC))Salesforce reported **$9.33 billion** in revenue for the comparable quarter last year (Q2 FY2025), reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. For the upcoming Q2 2025 period, management has guided revenue to approximately **$10.1 billion**, indicating a similar **8–9%** YoY increase. This guidance suggests steady demand for Salesforce’s cloud software and services, and even factors in a slight tailwind from a weaker U.S. dollar boosting overseas revenues ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,8%25%20in%20CC)). Considering the strong pipeline and consistent growth momentum, we forecast Salesforce’s Q2 2025 **revenue at about $10.2 billion**, slightly above the high end of guidance, anticipating a modest outperformance.

## EBITDA & Operating Income  
 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20continue%20to%20deliver%20disciplined,President%20and%20CFO%20of%20Salesforce)) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY))Salesforce has been **expanding its profit margins** through disciplined cost management and efficiency gains. Last year’s Q2 GAAP operating margin was **19.1%**, up 190 basis points from the prior year’s quarter ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20continue%20to%20deliver%20disciplined,President%20and%20CFO%20of%20Salesforce)). In the most recent quarter (Q1 FY2026), GAAP operating margin further improved to **19.8%** ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)). Management is maintaining a full-year FY2026 GAAP operating margin target of **21.6%**, signaling continued focus on profitability ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)). Given this trajectory, we project **EBITDA** for Q2 2025 around **$3.0 billion** and **operating income** around **$2.14 billion**. These forecasts assume GAAP operating margin will reach roughly **21%** for the quarter – a continuation of Salesforce’s margin expansion trend as revenue grows and cost controls remain in place.

## Net Income & EPS  
 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=,in%20Dividend%20Payments%20to%20Stockholders)) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20%20%7C%20%2410.11%20,%7C))Net income is expected to benefit from higher operating profits and Salesforce’s ongoing share buyback program. In Q2 last year, Salesforce generated approximately **15%** net margin, translating to solid GAAP profitability ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Salesforce-Announces-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx?os=av&ref=app#:~:text=Income%20before%20provision%20for%20income,)). Since then, the company has aggressively returned capital to shareholders – for instance, **$4.3 billion** was spent on share repurchases in Q2 FY2025 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=,in%20Dividend%20Payments%20to%20Stockholders)) – which has reduced the share count and boosted earnings per share. Management has indicated it intends to **fully offset stock-based compensation dilution** via buybacks ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20continue%20to%20deliver%20disciplined,%E2%80%9D)), supporting EPS growth. We anticipate net margin will improve to the mid-** teens** (around 17–18%) this quarter thanks to higher margins and possibly stable other income. As a result, **net income** is forecasted at roughly **$1.8 billion** for Q2 2025. This yields a **diluted EPS** of about **$1.85**, slightly above Salesforce’s own GAAP EPS guidance of ~$1.80–1.82 for the quarter ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20%20%7C%20%2410.11%20,%7C)). Our optimism on EPS reflects the combination of margin expansion and the share count reduction enhancing per-share earnings.

## Free Cash Flow  
 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=11,in%20Dividend%20Payments%20to%20Stockholders)) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY))Salesforce’s cash generation is expected to remain strong. In Q2 of last year, the company produced **$760 million** in free cash flow, a **20% YoY** increase driven by efficient expense management and robust collections ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828876673/en/#:~:text=11,in%20Dividend%20Payments%20to%20Stockholders)). For full-year FY2026, Salesforce guides to roughly **10%** growth in operating cash flow ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)), implying healthy cash conversion. Given this backdrop, we project **free cash flow** for Q2 2025 at approximately **$850 million**. This assumes Salesforce will sustain its improved working capital management and moderate capital expenditures, building on the prior year’s strong cash flow performance. An $850M FCF forecast represents continued solid cash generation in Q2, providing ample flexibility for ongoing buybacks and dividends.

# ServiceNow Inc. – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Revenue Outlook for Q2 2025  
ServiceNow’s momentum heading into 2025 suggests robust revenue growth for Q2 2025. In the prior year Q2 2024, ServiceNow reported **total revenues of $2.627 billion**, which was a 22% year-over-year increase ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)). For Q1 2025, the company’s total revenues reached **$3.088 billion (up 18.5% YoY)** with subscription revenues up 19% ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,billion%20as%20of%20Q1%202025)). Management’s guidance for Q2 2025 subscription sales was about **$3.03 billion** (roughly 19% YoY growth) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,)). However, ServiceNow has a history of exceeding its guidance – for instance, Q1 2025 *current remaining performance obligations* (cRPO) grew 22% YoY, surpassing guidance by 150–250 basis points ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202025%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)). This strong backlog and pipeline (fueled by demand for its AI-driven offerings) give confidence that Q2 2025 revenue will outpace the conservative guidance. We forecast Q2 2025 **total revenue around $3.215 billion**, implying roughly **22% YoY growth**, in line with the company’s long-term growth trajectory (they aim for **$15+ billion in revenue by 2026** ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=centered%20on%20%27Putting%20AI%20to,achieving%20%2415%2B%20billion%20in%202026))). This forecast reflects robust subscription demand and modest upside to guidance, supported by continued double-digit cRPO growth and execution on large enterprise deals (the number of $1M+ ACV deals was up 26% in Q2 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=,as%20interim%20Chief%20Product%20Officer)), a trend we expect to continue). 

## Profitability (EBITDA & Operating Income) Outlook  
ServiceNow has been expanding its margins through operational efficiencies and scale. GAAP operating margin nearly **doubled from 5% to 9%** in Q2 2024 (operating income of $240 million vs. $117 million in Q2 2023) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371524000269/erq2fy24.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%3A%20%20,)). Management’s outlook for full-year 2025 calls for further margin expansion – targeting a **30.5% non-GAAP operating margin**, up ~100 bps from 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,32)). In Q1 2025, the CFO highlighted “*meaningful opex efficiencies, yielding strong profitability*” ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=President%20and%20CFO%20Gina%20Mastantuono,%E2%80%9D)), which we expect to carry into Q2. We project GAAP **operating income of approximately $360 million** for Q2 2025, implying an **operating margin around 11%** – an improvement from 9% a year prior as revenue growth outpaces operating expense growth. For **EBITDA**, we add back depreciation and amortization to operating income. Depreciation & amortization was **$136 million in Q2 2024** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371524000269/erq2fy24.htm#:~:text=Adjustments%20to%20reconcile%20net%20income,%282%29)) and has been relatively stable, with slight increases driven by new investments. Assuming a similar or slightly higher D&A (~$140–$150 million) in Q2 2025, we forecast **EBITDA of roughly $500 million** for the quarter. This represents an EBITDA margin near 16%, reflecting ServiceNow’s strong operating leverage in its subscription model. 

## Net Income & EPS Forecast  
We anticipate a significant increase in Q2 2025 net profitability due to higher operating income and additional interest income from the company’s cash holdings (interest income was **$104 million in Q2 2024** amid higher interest rates ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371524000269/erq2fy24.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,362)), and could rise further in 2025). It’s worth noting that GAAP net income in Q2 2023 was abnormally high ($1.04 billion) due to a one-time **$910 million tax benefit** from a deferred tax valuation allowance release ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371524000269/erq2fy24.htm#:~:text=,of%20the%20effective%20tax%20rate)). Excluding such one-offs, ServiceNow’s underlying net income growth has been strong. For Q2 2025, we project **Net Income of about $380 million**, up from $262 million in Q2 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=Total%20gross%20profit%20%20,)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371524000269/erq2fy24.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L196%20Net%20income,%243.16%20%2F%20%243.13)). This forecast factors in the improved operating profit and assumes a steady effective tax rate. We also expect a slightly lower diluted share count around 209–210 million shares (the company has been offsetting dilution through buybacks ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Investment))). The result is a forecast **EPS of approximately $1.81** for Q2 2025. This would mark a substantial increase from the $1.26 GAAP diluted EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=Amount%20%28%24%20millions%29%20%20,%243.16%20%2F%20%243.13)), aligning with our projected ~45% growth in net income. 

## Free Cash Flow Forecast  
ServiceNow’s cash generation is expected to remain strong in Q2 2025, building on trends from Q1. In the first quarter of 2025, **free cash flow (FCF) jumped 48% YoY to $1.477 billion** ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Total%20gross%20profit%20%20,48)) as the company benefited from high subscription billings and disciplined spending. While Q2 is seasonally softer for collections (Q1 and Q4 see large annual contract renewals), we still anticipate a healthy improvement versus last year. In Q2 2024, FCF was **$359 million** (about 14% of revenue) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=Total%20gross%20profit%20%20,)). For Q2 2025, higher earnings and efficient working capital management should drive FCF higher. Management’s full-year 2025 outlook of **32% free cash flow margin** (up from 31% in 2024) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,32)) signals confidence in improved cash conversion. Balancing these factors, we project Q2 2025 **Free Cash Flow around $500 million**, equating to an FCF margin in the mid-teens (approximately 15–16% of revenue). This increase assumes continued growth in operating cash flow (which was **$620 million in Q2 2024** ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=Total%20gross%20profit%20%20,)) and likely around $700+ million in Q2 2025 given 22% higher sales and margin gains) and a stable capital expenditure level. Overall, ServiceNow’s strong profitability and subscription cash inflows are expected to yield a robust year-over-year FCF uplift in the quarter. 

## Q2 2025 Forecast Summary  
Finally, the table below summarizes our financial projections for ServiceNow in **2025 Q2**:

| Company        | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow | EPS   |

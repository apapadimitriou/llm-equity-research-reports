## AMD Q2 2025 Forecast Overview

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is expected to deliver strong year-over-year revenue growth in **Q2 2025**, although one-time charges will weigh on profitability. Management’s guidance calls for revenue of roughly **$7.4 billion** for the quarter ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,as%20previously%20disclosed%20in%20AMD%E2%80%99s)), which is **~27% higher** than the $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,69)). This robust growth is driven by continued strength in **data center** and **PC processor** sales. In Q1 2025, AMD’s **Data Center** segment revenue jumped 57% YoY to $3.7 billion ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,over)), and we anticipate that momentum to carry into Q2. The **client CPU** business (PC processors) is also rebounding – Q2 2024 client revenue was up 49% YoY ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=strong%20growth%20in%204,sequentially)) – so we expect solid PC chip sales in Q2 2025, aided by customers pulling in orders ahead of new tariffs ([www.bworldonline.com](https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2025/05/08/671020/amd-forecasts-1-5-billion-revenue-hit-from-us-curbs-on-china-chip-exports/#:~:text=But%20it%20issued%20a%20second,5)). **Gaming** segment sales (console and graphics chips) likely remain a softer spot, as Q1 saw gaming revenue down 30% YoY ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,over)); however, any weakness in gaming is outweighed by AMD’s growth in **server CPUs and AI accelerators**.

**Revenue:** Based on AMD’s outlook, we forecast Q2 2025 revenue of approximately **7,400,000,000**. This aligns with the midpoint of AMD’s guidance of ~$7.4 billion (±$300 million) ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,as%20previously%20disclosed%20in%20AMD%E2%80%99s)). It reflects robust demand for EPYC server processors and “Zen 5” Ryzen CPUs, partially offset by lower semi-custom (gaming) chip sales. The guidance was **above prior expectations**, reflecting strong orders – possibly as data center customers stock up on chips before export rules take effect ([www.bworldonline.com](https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2025/05/08/671020/amd-forecasts-1-5-billion-revenue-hit-from-us-curbs-on-china-chip-exports/#:~:text=But%20it%20issued%20a%20second,5)). Overall, ~27% YoY growth is expected, a significant acceleration from the 9% revenue growth in Q2 2024 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,69)).

**EBITDA:** We project **EBITDA** of roughly **800,000,000** for Q2 2025. This considers that AMD will incur large non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization) from past acquisitions (e.g. Xilinx) and an inventory write-down. In Q1 2025, AMD’s depreciation and amortization was about $742 million ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,%E2%80%94)). Adding back similar D&A to our Q2 operating results (which are depressed by one-time charges) yields an EBITDA on the order of **$0.8 billion**. We note that AMD’s underlying **adjusted EBITDA** performance is much higher; for example, Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA was $1.95 billion ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,1%2C295)) before unusual charges. The lower Q2 figure reflects the impact of the one-time inventory charge on earnings. In short, while GAAP operating profits will be near zero, adding back ~$0.7–0.8 billion of depreciation/amortization produces a few-hundred-million dollars of EBITDA.

**Operating Income:** We expect **GAAP operating income** to be roughly **50,000,000** (approximately break-even) in Q2 2025. AMD has warned it will take a **one-time ~$800 million** charge in Q2 tied to new U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips ([www.bworldonline.com](https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2025/05/08/671020/amd-forecasts-1-5-billion-revenue-hit-from-us-curbs-on-china-chip-exports/#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20AMD%20said%20it,gross%20margin%20excluding%20the%20charge)). This inventory-related charge will **reduce reported gross margin to ~43%** (an 11 percentage-point drop from an underlying ~54% gross margin without the charge) ([www.bworldonline.com](https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2025/05/08/671020/amd-forecasts-1-5-billion-revenue-hit-from-us-curbs-on-china-chip-exports/#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20AMD%20said%20it,gross%20margin%20excluding%20the%20charge)). The charge effectively **wipes out most of the quarter’s operating profit**. For context, AMD’s GAAP operating income was $806 million in Q1 2025 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,96)) before these export-related costs, and $269 million in Q2 2024 on much lower revenue ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,69)). In Q2 2025, however, the ~$800 million hit to cost of goods will offset the benefit of higher sales. We therefore anticipate only a **small positive** operating result (or approximately breakeven). The underlying business remains healthy – excluding the charge, AMD would likely have generated around **$800–900 million** in operating earnings this quarter – but the one-time cost brings GAAP operating income down near zero.

**Net Income:** Despite minimal operating profits, we project **Net Income** will stay slightly positive at about **100,000,000** for Q2 2025. AMD’s net income will benefit from two factors: **interest income** on its cash balance and a **reduced tax burden**. AMD carries substantial cash and short-term investments, which generated net other income in recent quarters ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=GAAP%20net%20income%20%20,123)) ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Interest%20expense%20%20,371)). Moreover, with pretax income near zero (due to the inventory charge), AMD’s effective tax rate for the quarter should be very low. The company indicated that most of the export control impact would hit Q2 and Q3 ([www.bworldonline.com](https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2025/05/08/671020/amd-forecasts-1-5-billion-revenue-hit-from-us-curbs-on-china-chip-exports/#:~:text=AMD%20Chief%20Executive%20Officer%20Lisa,%E2%80%9D)), and this may allow use of tax loss carryforwards or other tax benefits. As a result, we expect AMD to **avoid a GAAP net loss**. For comparison, AMD’s net income in Q2 2024 was $265 million ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,69)); we anticipate Q2 2025 net profit will be much lower year-on-year because of the one-time charge, but **remain slightly above break-even**. 

**Free Cash Flow:** AMD’s **free cash flow** is forecast to **increase substantially** in Q2 2025, reaching around **1,200,000,000**. Free cash flow will be strong because the $800 million inventory write-down, while hurting reported profit, **does not require an actual cash outlay**. In fact, this non-cash charge could boost operating cash flow by reducing taxable income and inventory on the balance sheet. AMD’s free cash flow was $727 million in Q1 2025 ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow,67%2C895)) and only $439 million in Q2 2024 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20,67%2C967)) (when earnings were much lower). Given higher earnings quality and likely some **working capital tailwinds** (for example, Q1’s large receivables should convert to cash in Q2), we estimate Q2 operating cash flow well above $1 billion. After deducting capital expenditures (which have been ~$200 million per quarter recently ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1247/amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,%28142))), **free cash flow could top $1.2 billion**. This reflects AMD’s solid cash generation from its growing data center and client businesses, **enhanced by the add-back of depreciation and inventory charges** in cash flow calculations. In short, **Q2 2025 free cash flow is expected to roughly **double year-over-year**, underscoring that the hefty inventory charge has little impact on liquidity.

**EPS:** We forecast **EPS (earnings per share)** of about **0.06** for Q2 2025 (approximately **6 cents** per share). This is the GAAP diluted EPS corresponding to our small net income projection. It represents a sharp decline from the $0.16 GAAP EPS AMD reported in Q2 2024 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-7-30-amd-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,69)), again due to the extraordinary inventory charge this quarter. For perspective, AMD’s **non-GAAP EPS** will be higher – the company earned $0.96 per share last quarter on an adjusted basis ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=announced%20financial%20results%20for%20the,96)) – but our $0.06 estimate reflects GAAP earnings after all charges. We assume ~1.6 billion diluted shares. There is a possibility that final GAAP EPS could be a few cents higher if a tax credit or one-time gain is realized (or a few cents lower if operating results fall short), but **roughly breakeven** earnings per share is our base case given the circumstances. Investors are likely to look past this temporarily depressed EPS, focusing instead on AMD’s strong **underlying EPS power** once the China export issue is resolved.

The table below summarizes our financial projections for **AMD’s 2025 Q2**:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|---------|------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| AMD     | 2025 | 2       | 7,400,000,000  | 800,000,000   | 50,000,000       | 100,000,000    | 1,200,000,000    | 0.06  |

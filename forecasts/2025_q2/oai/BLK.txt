# BlackRock (BLK) – Q2 2025 Forecast

In forecasting BlackRock’s Q2 2025 results, we consider the firm’s recent performance and industry trends up to mid-2025. BlackRock entered 2025 with strong asset growth: assets under management (AUM) hit a record $11.58 trillion in Q1 2025 (up from $10.47 trillion a year earlier) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-profit-falls-declining-fee-income-2025-04-11/#:~:text=2025,President%20Donald%20Trump%27s)). This increase was driven by market appreciation and steady net inflows, despite some client caution amid economic uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-profit-falls-declining-fee-income-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Fink%20noted%20heightened%20client%20anxiety,volatility%20through%20varying%20market%20conditions)). In Q2 2024, BlackRock had reported revenue of $4.805 billion (8% year-over-year growth) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=filing%20www,99%20million)), operating income of $1.8 billion, net income of $1.495 billion (9% YOY growth), and diluted EPS of $9.99 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=match%20at%20L69%20Operating%20Income,10)). We use these as a baseline for our Q2 2025 projections.

**Revenue:** We anticipate **Revenue** for Q2 2025 to rise by low double-digits year-over-year. In Q1 2025, revenue grew 12% YoY to $5.276 billion ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKROCK-INC-176512022/news/BlackRock-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-49596832/#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,19)) on higher average AUM and fee growth, and we expect a similar trend in Q2. Global markets rallied through Q2 2025 on optimism around trade policy and potential Fed rate cuts, boosting asset values. We project average AUM for Q2 2025 increased ~15% YoY (to around $12.5 trillion by quarter-end, from ~$10.7 trillion a year prior) thanks to this market uplift and continued inflows. However, Q1 earnings commentary noted **client anxiety** and a **slowdown in inflows** relative to late 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-profit-falls-declining-fee-income-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Fink%20noted%20heightened%20client%20anxiety,volatility%20through%20varying%20market%20conditions)), so net new assets in Q2 may be slightly lower than the $82 billion achieved in Q2 2024 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,the%20first%20half%20of%202024)). Balancing these factors, we forecast Q2 2025 revenue of **≈$5.35 billion**, roughly 11%–12% higher than the $4.805 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=filing%20www,99%20million)).

**EBITDA & Operating Income:** BlackRock’s expense base is expected to grow more slowly than revenue, aided by operating leverage and cost discipline. In Q2 2024, operating income was $1.8 billion, with a 37.5% margin ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024091706/blk-20240630.htm#:~:text=Three%20Months%20Ended%20June%2030%2C,Months%20Ended%20June%2030%2C%202023)). For Q2 2025, we factor in slightly improved margins (~38%) as higher base fees and technology revenues offset moderate compensation increases. We also note that Q1 2025 GAAP operating income was flat YoY due to one-time acquisition-related costs ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKROCK-INC-176512022/news/BlackRock-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-49596832/#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%20,21)). Excluding those, *adjusted* operating profit grew 14% in Q1 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKROCK-INC-176512022/news/BlackRock-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-49596832/#:~:text=,)), indicating core margin expansion. Assuming fewer one-time costs in Q2, we project **Operating Income** around **$2.0 billion** for Q2 2025 (up ~11% YoY). Adding back depreciation and amortization (which were about $110 million in Q2 2024, and may be higher after recent acquisitions), we estimate **EBITDA** close to **$2.13 billion**. This reflects an EBITDA margin near 40%, consistent with BlackRock’s asset-light, fee-centric business model.

**Net Income:** BlackRock’s **Net Income** is forecast to increase modestly year-over-year in Q2 2025. Q2 2024 net income was $1.495 billion ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=match%20at%20L69%20Operating%20Income,10)) with help from some non-operating gains. In Q1 2025, GAAP net income actually fell 4% YoY due to acquisition costs and a higher share count ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKROCK-INC-176512022/news/BlackRock-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-49596832/#:~:text=,184)). Many of those costs were one-time, so Q2 should see a cleaner comparison. We expect interest expense to remain low (the company repaid $1.0B of debt in March 2024) and anticipate no major negative mark-to-market impacts given strong markets (non-operating items contributed positively in the prior year ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=technology%20services%20revenue,year%20%2812%25%20as%20adjusted))). Assuming a near-normal effective tax rate (~25%), we project Q2 2025 net income around **$1.55–1.60 billion**, slightly above the prior-year quarter. 

**Free Cash Flow:** BlackRock’s **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** typically swings with seasonal compensation payments. Q1 is usually weak due to annual bonus payouts – for example, FCF was **–$472 million in Q1 2024** and **–$1.206 billion in Q1 2025** ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BLK/blackrock/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2025,30%20%20%7C%20886.00)). In the following quarter, cash flow recovers as fee collections continue and fewer large cash outflows occur. Q2 2024 saw FCF rebound to **+$886 million** ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BLK/blackrock/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2025,30%20%20%7C%20886.00)). We expect a similar pattern in Q2 2025, forecasting roughly **$1.0 billion** in free cash flow. This assumes operating cash flow once again turns strongly positive (as accrual of new compensation and fee receipts outpace any working capital uses), minus roughly $70–$80 million of capital expenditures (in line with prior quarters).

**Earnings Per Share:** Finally, we project **EPS** for Q2 2025 at about **$10.20–$10.30**. This reflects our net income forecast (≈$1.55–1.6B) and an estimated diluted share count of ~156 million. BlackRock’s share count rose in late 2024 due to equity issuance for acquisitions (Q4 2024 had 157.0 million shares vs 150.2 million a year prior) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx)), but the company has been buying back shares in 2025 (~$375M in Q1) to partially offset dilution ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKROCK-INC-176512022/news/BlackRock-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-49596832/#:~:text=%24375%20million%20of%20share%20repurchases,21%20per%20share)). The higher share count means EPS growth will be muted relative to net income. Our EPS estimate of around $10.25 is slightly above the $9.99 GAAP EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2473120/blackrock-inc-q2-2024-earnings-eps-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=match%20at%20L69%20Operating%20Income,10)), implying low-to-mid single digit growth year-on-year.

Here are the financial forecasts for Amazon.com (AMZN) for Q2 2025, based on information available on or before July 17, 2025. The forecasts are derived from Amazon's Q1 2025 earnings report and associated guidance for Q2 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

*   **Revenue:** Based on Amazon's Q2 2025 net sales guidance of $159.0 billion to $164.0 billion, the midpoint of this range was used.
*   **Operating Income:** Based on Amazon's Q2 2025 operating income guidance of $13.0 billion to $17.5 billion, the midpoint of this range was used.
*   **Net Income:** No explicit guidance was provided for Net Income. The Q2 2024 Net Income to Operating Income ratio (Q2 2024 Net Income of $13.5 billion divided by Q2 2024 Operating Income of $14.7 billion, approximately 0.918) was applied to the forecasted Q2 2025 Operating Income.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated by dividing the forecasted Net Income by an estimated diluted shares outstanding of 10.75 billion, which is derived from Q1 2025 actuals ($17.1 billion Net Income / $1.59 EPS).
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding an assumed Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to the forecasted Operating Income. D&A was estimated at 7.5% of the forecasted Q2 2025 Revenue, consistent with historical trends and considering ongoing capital investments.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** No explicit guidance was provided. Free Cash Flow was estimated by projecting quarterly Operating Cash Flow and subtracting estimated Capital Expenditures. Quarterly Operating Cash Flow was estimated based on the trailing twelve months (TTM) Operating Cash Flow from Q1 2025 ($113.9 billion) and adjusted for revenue growth. Capital Expenditures were estimated to be around $25 billion, slightly higher than Q1 2025 capex ($24.3 billion), reflecting continued investment.

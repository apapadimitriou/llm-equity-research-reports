Here are the financial forecasts for S&P Global (SPGI) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information on or before July 17, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:** S&P Global reported Q1 2025 revenue of $3.777 billion, an 8% increase year-over-year. The company updated its full-year 2025 revenue growth guidance to 4% - 6% (from an earlier 5-7%) after Q1 results, implying a deceleration in growth for the remaining quarters. Q2 2024 revenue was $3.549 billion. For Q2 2025, I project a 5% year-over-year growth, which is the midpoint of the revised full-year guidance.
    *   *Calculation:* $3,549,000,000 (Q2 2024 Revenue) \* 1.05 = $3,726,450,000

2.  **Operating Income:** S&P Global provided full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin guidance of 48.5% - 49.5%. Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin was 50.8%, and Q2 2024 adjusted operating margin was 50.7%. Given the full-year guidance is slightly lower than recent quarterly performance, I will use the midpoint of the full-year adjusted operating margin guidance, 49%, for Q2 2025. To derive GAAP Operating Income, I will subtract an estimated quarterly deal-related amortization. The full-year 2025 deal-related amortization guidance is approximately $1.11 billion.
    *   *Calculation (Adjusted Operating Income):* $3,726,450,000 (2025_Q2 Revenue) \* 0.49 = $1,825,960,500
    *   *Calculation (Quarterly Deal-related Amortization):* $1,110,000,000 / 4 = $277,500,000
    *   *Calculation (GAAP Operating Income):* $1,825,960,500 - $277,500,000 = $1,548,460,500

3.  **EBITDA:** EBITDA is calculated as GAAP Operating Income plus Depreciation & Amortization (D&A). For full-year 2024, total D&A was approximately $1.474 billion ($7.054 billion EBITDA - $5.58 billion Operating Income). I will use an estimated quarterly D&A of $368.5 million ($1.474 billion / 4).
    *   *Calculation:* $1,548,460,500 (2025_Q2 Operating Income) + $368,500,000 (Estimated D&A) = $1,916,960,500

4.  **Net Income:** To forecast Net Income, I start with GAAP Operating Income, subtract estimated interest expense, and apply an effective tax rate. Based on Q2 2024 figures, estimated quarterly interest expense is approximately $289 million. The effective tax rate for S&P Global averaged 22.2% from 2020-2024, with the latest twelve months at 22.6%. I will use 22.5%.
    *   *Calculation (Pre-tax Income):* $1,548,460,500 (2025_Q2 Operating Income) - $289,000,000 (Estimated Interest Expense) = $1,259,460,500
    *   *Calculation (Net Income):* $1,259,460,500 \* (1 - 0.225) = $975,041,388

5.  **Free Cash Flow:** S&P Global provided full-year 2025 adjusted free cash flow guidance of $5.6 - $5.8 billion. Q1 2025 adjusted free cash flow was $901 million. This leaves approximately $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion for the remaining three quarters. Assuming a reasonable distribution, and a sequential increase from Q1, I project Q2 2025 Free Cash Flow.
    *   *Projection:* $1,500,000,000

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS is calculated by dividing Net Income by diluted shares outstanding. Q1 2025 GAAP diluted EPS was $3.54 on $1.090 billion GAAP Net Income, implying approximately 307.9 million diluted shares outstanding. The company has been actively repurchasing shares. I will use an estimated 307 million diluted shares outstanding for Q2 2025.
    *   *Calculation:* $975,041,388 (2025_Q2 Net Income) / 307,000,000 (Estimated Diluted Shares) = $3.18

Here are the financial forecasts for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) for the second quarter of 2025 (Microsoft's fiscal year 2025, fourth quarter), based on publicly available information and company guidance existing on or before July 16, 2025.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

The forecasts for Q2 2025 (Microsoft's Q4 FY25) are derived from Microsoft's Q3 FY25 earnings report and conference call guidance, released on April 30, 2025.

1.  **Revenue:**
    *   Q3 FY25 (ended March 31, 2025) revenue was $70.1 billion.
    *   Guidance for Q4 FY25 (calendar Q2 2025) from the Q3 FY25 earnings call:
        *   Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth in the "high single digits" (assumed 8% growth from Q3 FY25 segment revenue of $29.9 billion) = $32.292 billion.
        *   Intelligent Cloud revenue guidance of $28.75 billion to $29.05 billion (midpoint used: $28.9 billion).
        *   More Personal Computing revenue growth in the "mid-single digits" (assumed 5% growth from Q3 FY25 segment revenue of $13.32 billion, calculated as total revenue less PBP and Intelligent Cloud) = $13.986 billion.
    *   Total Revenue Forecast = $32.292 billion + $28.9 billion + $13.986 billion = $75.178 billion.

2.  **Operating Income:**
    *   Q3 FY25 operating income was $32.0 billion on $70.1 billion revenue, implying an operating margin of approximately 45.65%.
    *   Management indicated expectations for full-year FY25 operating margins to be "up slightly year-over-year". Assuming a slight improvement in Q4 FY25 to 45.7%.
    *   Operating Income Forecast = $75,178,000,000 \* 0.457 = $34,356,866,000.

3.  **Net Income:**
    *   Q3 FY25 net income was $25.8 billion on $70.1 billion revenue, implying a net income margin of approximately 36.80%.
    *   Assuming a similar net income margin for Q4 FY25 of 36.8%.
    *   Net Income Forecast = $75,178,000,000 \* 0.368 = $27,678,944,000.

4.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**
    *   Q3 FY25 diluted EPS was $3.46.
    *   Estimated shares outstanding from Q3 FY25 = Net Income / EPS = $25,800,000,000 / $3.46 = 7,456,647,399 shares.
    *   EPS Forecast = Net Income Forecast / Shares Outstanding = $27,678,944,000 / 7,456,647,399 = $3.71.

5.  **EBITDA:**
    *   EBITDA is calculated as Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization (D&A).
    *   While specific D&A guidance for Q4 FY25 was not explicitly provided in the Q3 FY25 call, the trend of increased capital expenditures for AI infrastructure suggests elevated D&A. Based on historical trends and the known acceleration of investments, D&A for Q4 FY25 is estimated at $9,500,000,000.
    *   EBITDA Forecast = $34,356,866,000 (Operating Income) + $9,500,000,000 (D&A) = $43,856,866,000.

6.  **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Free Cash Flow (FCF) = Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) - Capital Expenditures (CapEx).
    *   CapEx: Analysts expected Q4 CapEx to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion due to AI and cloud infrastructure growth. Using the midpoint of $16.5 billion.
    *   CFO: Estimated as Net Income + D&A, assuming other non-cash adjustments and working capital changes are largely offsetting or minor for forecasting purposes.
    *   CFO Forecast = $27,678,944,000 (Net Income) + $9,500,000,000 (D&A) = $37,178,944,000.
    *   Free Cash Flow Forecast = $37,178,944,000 (CFO) - $16,500,000,000 (CapEx) = $20,678,944,000.

As an equity research analyst, I have prepared a forecast for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) for the second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2). This forecast is based on publicly available information as of July 2, 2025, including the company's Q1 2025 earnings release and associated commentary, and analyst consensus data available prior to this date.

**Key Considerations and Methodology:**

*   **Q1 2025 Performance:** Goldman Sachs reported strong Q1 2025 results with net revenues of $15.06 billion and diluted EPS of $14.12. Operating expenses for Q1 2025 were $9.1 billion, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 60.6%. The effective tax rate for Q1 2025 was 16.1%, with a full-year expectation of approximately 21%.
*   **Management Outlook:** CEO David Solomon noted that Goldman Sachs was "entering the second quarter with a markedly different operating environment than earlier this year," while remaining confident in supporting clients. This suggests potential shifts or moderation compared to the strong Q1.
*   **Q2 2025 EPS Consensus:** A crucial anchor for the Q2 2025 forecast is the consensus diluted EPS of $9.43, which was available prior to July 2, 2025. This figure is lower than Q1 2025, aligning with the "markedly different operating environment" commentary.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Based on Q1 2025 results and anticipated trends, Q2 2025 operating expenses are projected to be around $9.2 billion.
*   **Shares Outstanding:** Q1 2025 diluted EPS was calculated on approximately 335.7 million shares ($4.74 billion Net Earnings / $14.12 EPS). Given the firm's capital return activities, including common stock repurchases, a slight reduction in shares outstanding to 330 million for Q2 2025 is assumed.
*   **Tax Rate:** The effective tax rate for Q2 2025 is estimated at 22%, consistent with the expected full-year rate of approximately 21% and the first-half average of 20.2%.
*   **Revenue Derivation:** Working backward from the consensus EPS of $9.43, and applying the estimated shares outstanding and tax rate, the projected net income and pre-tax income were used to derive the revenue forecast, which reflects a moderation from Q1 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** For financial institutions, EBITDA is not a standard reported metric. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) figures are typically a smaller component of expenses. Based on historical trends, D&A is estimated at $350 million for the quarter.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF for a financial institution can be highly variable and is not a primary reported metric in the same way as for industrial companies. Given the lack of specific FCF guidance in the available information, the forecast for FCF is a qualitative estimate, assuming positive cash generation but potentially lower than net income due to the nature of a bank's balance sheet movements.

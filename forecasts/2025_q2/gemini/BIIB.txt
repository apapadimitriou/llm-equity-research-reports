Here are the financial forecasts for Biogen Inc. (BIIB) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information up to July 17, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Rationale for Q2 2025 Forecasts:**

1.  **Revenue:** Biogen reported Q1 2025 revenue of $2.431 billion, which was up 6% year-over-year, partly aided by the timing of Spinraza and corporate partner revenue shipments. For the full year 2025, Biogen expects total revenue to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to full-year 2024 revenue of $9.7 billion. This decline is primarily driven by the multiple sclerosis (MS) business, partially offset by growth from launch products like Leqembi, Skyclarys, and Zurzuvae. Given the full-year guidance for a decline and the Q1 performance having some timing benefits, Q2 revenue is projected to see a sequential decrease from Q1, aligning with the overall annual trend. An estimated 5% full-year decline from $9.7 billion (2024) implies a total of $9.215 billion for 2025. After Q1's $2.431 billion, the remaining three quarters average approximately $2.261 billion. Therefore, Q2 revenue is estimated at $2.280 billion.

2.  **Operating Income:** Q1 2025 GAAP Operating Income was $380 million. Q1 included a significant GAAP acquired IPR&D, upfront and milestone expense of $201 million, which included a $165 million upfront payment to Stoke Therapeutics. This payment significantly impacted Q1 EPS by approximately $0.95. Assuming no similar large, non-recurring upfront payments in Q2, operating expenses are expected to be lower. Biogen also expects combined Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be approximately $3.9 billion for the full year 2025, supported by its "Fit for Growth" initiative aiming for $800 million in net savings by year-end. Q1 GAAP Cost of Sales was 25.9% of revenue. Applying this percentage to the Q2 revenue forecast and estimating R&D and SG&A (excluding the Q1 IPR&D impact) at $970 million (in line with the full-year average and savings initiatives) leads to the operating income forecast.

3.  **EBITDA:** Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) figures were not explicitly detailed for Q1 2025 in the provided snippets. Based on typical large biotechnology company profiles, D&A is estimated to be around $200 million per quarter. EBITDA is calculated by adding this estimated D&A back to the projected Operating Income.

4.  **Net Income:** Q1 2025 GAAP Other Expense was approximately $68 million, and the GAAP effective tax rate was 22.7%. These figures are assumed to remain consistent for Q2 2025. Net Income is derived by subtracting estimated Other Expense and Taxes from Operating Income.

5.  **Free Cash Flow:** Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow was $222 million, which included the $165 million upfront payment to Stoke Therapeutics. Net cash flow from operations was $259 million, and capital expenditures were $37 million. For Q2, with the absence of the large Stoke upfront payment, net cash flow from operations is expected to improve. Free Cash Flow is calculated by starting with Net Income, adding back D&A, making an assumption for non-cash items and working capital changes (estimated at a positive $50 million due to the absence of the large Q1 outflow), and subtracting estimated capital expenditures (assumed to be consistent with Q1 at $37 million).

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Q1 2025 weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 147 million. This figure is assumed to remain constant for Q2 2025. EPS is calculated by dividing the projected Net Income by the estimated shares outstanding. The resulting Q2 EPS, combined with Q1's non-GAAP EPS of $3.02, aligns reasonably with Biogen's full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $14.50 to $15.50.

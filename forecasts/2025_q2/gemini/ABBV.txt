| :----------- | :--- | :------ | :------------- | :------------- | :--------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :--- |

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** AbbVie provided guidance for Q2 2025 net revenues of approximately $15 billion during its Q1 2025 earnings call on April 25, 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** AbbVie provided adjusted diluted EPS guidance for Q2 2025 between $3.26 and $3.30. The forecast uses the midpoint of this guidance, $3.28. This guidance excludes acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the forecasted EPS by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2025 were 1,772 million. Therefore, Net Income = $3.28 \* 1,772,000,000 = $5,809,760,000.
*   **Operating Income:** To derive Operating Income, we work backward from Net Income using the adjusted tax rate and net interest expense. The adjusted tax rate for Q1 2025 was 14.2%. Assuming this rate for Q2, Pre-Tax Income = Net Income / (1 - Tax Rate) = $5,809,760,000 / (1 - 0.142) = $6,771,282,051. Net interest expense for Q1 2025 was $627 million, which is assumed to be similar for Q2 2025. Thus, Operating Income = Pre-Tax Income + Net Interest Expense = $6,771,282,051 + $627,000,000 = $7,398,282,051. This aligns closely with the company's Q1 earnings call statement forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 49.5% for the quarter (excluding IPR&D), which would yield $15,000,000,000 * 0.495 = $7,425,000,000.
*   **EBITDA:** Calculated by adding Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. AbbVie's Depreciation & Amortization (CF) for June 2025 is reported as $186 million. Therefore, EBITDA = $7,398,282,051 (Operating Income) + $186,000,000 (D&A) = $7,584,282,051.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Specific guidance for Q2 2025 capital expenditures and changes in working capital was not provided. Based on the lack of detailed components for a precise calculation, Free Cash Flow is estimated as 85% of Net Income, a common approximation for mature pharmaceutical companies with stable operations. Free Cash Flow = $5,809,760,000 \* 0.85 = $4,938,296,000.

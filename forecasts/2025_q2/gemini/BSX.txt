Here are the financial forecasts for Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information as of July 9, 2025:

**Forecast Methodology:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for Q2 2025 Revenue is derived from Boston Scientific's Q2 2025 reported net sales growth guidance of 17.5% to 19.5% (midpoint 18.5%) compared to Q2 2024. Q2 2024 net sales were $4.120 billion.
    *   Projected Q2 2025 Revenue = $4,120,000,000 * (1 + 0.185) = $4,882,200,000.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The forecast uses the midpoint of the company's Q2 2025 GAAP EPS guidance of $0.45 to $0.47.
    *   Projected Q2 2025 EPS = $0.46.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the projected GAAP EPS by the number of shares outstanding as of January 31, 2025 (1,475,778,104 shares).
    *   Projected Q2 2025 Net Income = $0.46 * 1,475,778,104 = $678,857,928.
*   **Operating Income:** Based on the Q1 2025 reported operating margin of 19.8% applied to the projected Q2 2025 Revenue.
    *   Projected Q2 2025 Operating Income = $4,882,200,000 * 0.198 = $966,675,600.
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by applying a historical ratio of (Operating Income + Amortization Expense) to Revenue. Using data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the approximate EBITDA margin was 21.0% (Operating Income of $1,928 million + Amortization Expense of $631 million) / Net Sales of $12,186 million.
    *   Projected Q2 2025 EBITDA = $4,882,200,000 * 0.210 = $1,025,262,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Derived by first estimating the full-year 2025 Free Cash Flow by applying the midpoint of the full-year 2025 reported revenue growth guidance (15% to 17%, midpoint 16%) to the full-year 2024 Free Cash Flow of $2.65 billion. This estimated full-year FCF is then divided by four to get an average quarterly figure.
    *   Estimated Full Year 2025 FCF = $2,650,000,000 * (1 + 0.16) = $3,074,000,000.
    *   Projected Q2 2025 Free Cash Flow = $3,074,000,000 / 4 = $768,500,000.

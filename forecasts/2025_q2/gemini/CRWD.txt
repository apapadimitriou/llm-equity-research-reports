Here are the financial forecasts for CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information on or before August 13, 2025.

CrowdStrike's fiscal year ends on January 31st. Therefore, fiscal year 2025 Q2 corresponds to the quarter ending July 31, 2024. The forecasts are derived primarily from the company's Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings release and conference call transcript, dated June 4, 2024, which provided guidance for Q2 fiscal year 2025.

**Key Forecast Assumptions:**

*   **Revenue, Operating Income, Net Income, and EPS:** These metrics are based on the midpoint of the non-GAAP guidance ranges provided by CrowdStrike for Q2 fiscal year 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** CrowdStrike's guidance for Q2 FY2025 did not explicitly include Depreciation & Amortization (D&A). Therefore, EBITDA is estimated by adding an assumed D&A to the non-GAAP operating income. Based on typical software company financials and the absence of specific guidance in the provided sources, D&A is estimated at 4% of the forecasted revenue for the quarter.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** CrowdStrike maintained its full fiscal year 2025 free cash flow margin target of 31% to 33% of revenue and indicated Q1 to Q2 seasonality similar to the prior year. Given Q1 FY2025 FCF was 35% of revenue, and the full-year target is 31-33%, the Q2 FCF margin is estimated at the midpoint of the full-year guidance, 32% of forecasted revenue.

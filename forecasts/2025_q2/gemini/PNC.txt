Here are the financial forecasts for PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 2, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology and Assumptions:**

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2025 total revenue was $5.5 billion. PNC's Q1 2025 earnings call guidance indicated full-year 2025 total revenue to be up approximately 6% compared to full-year 2024. Full-year 2024 revenue was $21.6 billion. This implies a 2025 full-year revenue of approximately $22.896 billion. Given the Q1 2025 guidance for average loans to be up approximately 1% in Q2 2025 compared to Q1 2025, and the full-year revenue growth expectation, a sequential revenue increase from Q1 to Q2 is anticipated. We project a 2.5% sequential growth from Q1 2025 revenue.
*   **Operating Income:** Q1 2025 non-interest expense was $3.4 billion. The Q1 2025 guidance for full-year 2025 non-interest expenses was to be up approximately 1% compared to 2024. We estimated Q1 2025 Operating Income by working backward from Net Income, Provision for Credit Losses, and the effective tax rate. We then projected Q2 2025 operating expenses with a slight sequential increase of 0.5% from Q1 2025, in line with the full-year guidance for expense control.
*   **Net Income:** Based on the projected Operating Income, we applied an estimated provision for credit losses of $250 million for Q2 2025 (Q1 2025 provision was $219 million, and Q4 2024 was $232 million), and the guided effective tax rate of 19% for full-year 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated by dividing the projected Net Income by an estimated diluted share count. Q1 2025 diluted shares outstanding were approximately 427.35 million (derived from Q1 Net Income of $1.5 billion and EPS of $3.51). Considering share repurchases in Q1 2025, we estimate a slightly reduced share count of 425 million for Q2 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a standard reported metric. We derive it by adding back Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. Q1 2025 Depreciation and Amortization was $89 million. We assume D&A remains stable at $89 million for Q2 2025.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Free Cash Flow for a bank is also not a standard metric and is complex to derive without full cash flow statements. For this forecast, we estimate "Net cash provided by operating activities" by adjusting Net Income for non-cash items like Depreciation & Amortization and Provision for Credit Losses. We then subtract an estimated Capital Expenditure (purchases of premises and equipment). We estimate quarterly capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, a reasonable figure for a bank's fixed asset investments.

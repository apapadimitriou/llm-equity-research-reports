As an equity research analyst, I have prepared the following financial forecast for Salesforce Inc. (CRM) for the second quarter of calendar year 2025 (2025_Q2). This period corresponds to Salesforce's fiscal second quarter of 2026 (Q2 FY26), which runs from May 1, 2025, to July 31, 2025. The forecasts are based on Salesforce's Q1 FY26 earnings report and associated guidance released on May 28, 2025, and other public information available on or before August 13, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Salesforce provided Q2 FY26 revenue guidance in the range of $10.11 billion to $10.16 billion. The forecast uses the midpoint of this guidance.
*   **Operating Income:** Salesforce maintained its full-year FY26 non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 34.0%. This margin is applied to the forecasted revenue to derive operating income.
*   **EBITDA:** Specific EBITDA guidance was not provided. To estimate EBITDA, a depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense of approximately 1.5% of revenue is added to the non-GAAP operating income. This is a common estimation approach for software companies in the absence of explicit guidance, considering non-GAAP operating income already excludes stock-based compensation.
*   **Net Income:** Salesforce provided Q2 FY26 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $2.76 to $2.78. The midpoint of this range is used. To calculate net income, this EPS is multiplied by an estimated diluted share count of 980 million, based on figures from Salesforce's Q4 FY25 guidance for Q1 FY26.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Salesforce maintained its full-year FY26 free cash flow growth guidance of approximately 9% to 10% year-over-year. Based on FY25 free cash flow of $12.4 billion, the midpoint of the growth guidance implies a full-year FY26 free cash flow of approximately $13.578 billion. Given Q1 FY26 free cash flow of $6.3 billion, and typical seasonality where Q1 is strong, Q2 free cash flow is estimated as approximately 22% of the total projected FY26 free cash flow.
*   **EPS:** The forecast uses the midpoint of Salesforce's Q2 FY26 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance.

As an equity research analyst on July 1, 2025, I am providing a forecast for State Street Corporation (STT) for Q2 2025. This forecast is based on State Street's reported Q1 2025 financial results, Q2 2024 historical data, and the full-year 2025 guidance provided by the company prior to July 1, 2025.

**Key Information Used for Forecast:**

*   **Q1 2025 Results (reported April 17, 2025):**
    *   Revenue: $3.28 billion
    *   Net Income: $644 million
    *   EPS: $2.04
    *   Expenses: $2.4 billion
    *   Pre-tax margin (excluding seasonal expenses): 30%
    *   Operating Income (calculated as Revenue - Expenses): $3.28 billion - $2.4 billion = $880 million.
    *   Implied Effective Tax Rate (from Q1 2025 Operating Income and Net Income): ($880 million - $644 million) / $880 million = 26.8%.

*   **Q2 2024 Results (reported July 16, 2024):**
    *   Revenue: $3.19 billion
    *   EPS: $2.15

*   **Full-Year 2025 Guidance (available prior to July 1, 2025):**
    *   Total fee revenue growth: "at or slightly above the 5% to 7% range". I will use a midpoint of 6% for overall revenue growth.
    *   Expense growth: "upper end of the 3% to 4% range". I will use 4% for expense growth.

*   **Shares Outstanding:**
    *   Shares outstanding for the quarter ending June 30, 2025: 290,000,000 (0.290 billion).

**Forecast Methodology for Q2 2025:**

1.  **Revenue:** I will project Q2 2025 revenue by applying the midpoint of the full-year revenue growth guidance (6%) to the Q2 2024 reported revenue.
    *   Forecasted Q2 2025 Revenue = $3,190,000,000 (Q2 2024 Revenue) * (1 + 0.06) = $3,381,400,000.

2.  **Operating Income:** I will estimate Q2 2025 operating income by first estimating Q2 2025 expenses. To do this, I will calculate the Q1 2025 operating margin (Operating Income / Revenue) and apply it to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue.
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Margin = $880,000,000 / $3,280,000,000 = 0.2683.
    *   Forecasted Q2 2025 Operating Income = $3,381,400,000 (Forecasted Q2 2025 Revenue) * 0.2683 = $906,200,620.

3.  **Net Income:** I will apply the implied effective tax rate from Q1 2025 to the forecasted Q2 2025 Operating Income.
    *   Forecasted Q2 2025 Net Income = $906,200,620 (Forecasted Q2 2025 Operating Income) * (1 - 0.268) = $663,206,857.6.

4.  **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) are typically not as significant as in other industries and are not explicitly provided in the available quarterly summaries. Therefore, I will assume EBITDA is approximately equal to Operating Income.
    *   Forecasted Q2 2025 EBITDA = $906,200,620.

5.  **Free Cash Flow:** A precise forecast for Free Cash Flow for a financial institution on a quarterly basis is not feasible with the publicly available information.

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** I will divide the forecasted Q2 2025 Net Income by the estimated shares outstanding for Q2 2025.
    *   Forecasted Q2 2025 EPS = $663,206,857.6 (Forecasted Q2 2025 Net Income) / 290,000,000 (Shares Outstanding) = $2.2869.

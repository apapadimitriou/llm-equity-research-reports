Citigroup (C) is projected to report a solid second quarter in 2025, building on the momentum observed in the first quarter and aligning with the company's full-year guidance available as of July 1, 2025. The forecasts are based on Citigroup's Q1 2025 earnings report released on April 15, 2025, and the full-year 2025 guidance provided at that time.

For the full year 2025, Citigroup had guided for revenues between $83.1 billion and $84.1 billion, and expenses slightly below $53.4 billion.

**Key Forecast Assumptions for 2025_Q2:**

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2025 revenue was $21.6 billion. Utilizing the midpoint of the full-year revenue guidance of $83.6 billion and considering the "continued momentum" across its businesses, Q2 revenue is projected to see a modest sequential increase.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Q1 2025 operating expenses were $13.425 billion. Based on the full-year expense guidance of slightly below $53.4 billion, Q2 operating expenses are expected to remain disciplined and in line with the average for the remaining quarters.
*   **Provisions for Credit Losses:** Q1 2025 provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims were $2.723 billion. In the absence of specific Q2 guidance, this figure is assumed to be relatively consistent.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as projected revenue less projected operating expenses and provisions for credit losses.
*   **Net Income:** Derived from projected operating income, applying an estimated effective tax rate of 25%, consistent with the Q1 2025 effective tax rate.
*   **EPS:** Calculated by dividing projected net income by the implied diluted shares outstanding from Q1 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a standard reported metric. It is estimated by adding back a conservative approximation of depreciation and amortization (assumed to be 5% of operating expenses) to operating income. This is a highly estimated figure due to the lack of specific depreciation and amortization data.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for a bank is complex and not directly reported in the provided snippets. As a highly estimated figure, it is approximated as 80% of net income, reflecting cash generated after some internal funding needs but before dividends and share repurchases.

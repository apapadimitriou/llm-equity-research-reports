**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for Q2 2025 Revenue is based on the analyst consensus estimate of $14.67 billion, which was available prior to Eli Lilly's Q2 2025 earnings release date of August 7, 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The EPS forecast of $5.59 for Q2 2025 is derived from the analyst consensus for adjusted earnings per share, also available before the Q2 earnings announcement.
*   **Net Income:** Net Income is calculated by multiplying the forecasted EPS by the estimated diluted shares outstanding for Q2 2025. The diluted shares outstanding for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, were reported as 946.833 million (946,833,000 shares). Therefore, Net Income = $5.59 * 946,833,000 = $5,293,426,470.
*   **Operating Income:** To project Operating Income, an estimated GAAP Operating Margin of 30% was applied to the forecasted Revenue. This margin was derived by analyzing Eli Lilly's full-year 2024 GAAP Operating Margin (28.15% from $12,680.4 million Operating Income on $45,042.7 million Revenue) and an estimated Q1 2025 GAAP Operating Margin (approximately 30.29%, calculated from Q1 2025 Revenue of $12.73 billion, a non-GAAP performance margin of 42.6%, and acquired IPR&D charges of $1.57 billion). The 30% estimate reflects a slight improvement from 2024, consistent with the company's strong performance in key products.
*   **EBITDA:** EBITDA is estimated by adding Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to the Operating Income. The Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) D&A ending June 2025 was $1,893 million. Assuming a relatively even distribution of D&A across quarters, the estimated D&A for Q2 2025 is approximately $1,893 million / 4 = $473.25 million. Therefore, EBITDA = $4,401,000,000 (Operating Income) + $473,250,000 (D&A) = $4,874,250,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is projected based on its historical relationship with Net Income. The Free Cash Flow to Net Income ratio was approximately 35.5% for both full-year 2024 ($3,760 million FCF / $10,590 million Net Income) and the TTM ending June 2025 ($4,885 million FCF / $13,800 million Net Income). Applying this ratio to the forecasted Q2 2025 Net Income: Free Cash Flow = $5,293,426,470 * 0.355 = $1,878,168,301.

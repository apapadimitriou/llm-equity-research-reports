As an equity research analyst on July 9, 2025, I am providing a forecast for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) for the second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2). This forecast is based on publicly available information, including Alphabet's historical financial performance, earnings call transcripts, and company guidance released on or before July 9, 2025.

**Key Considerations for the Forecast:**

*   **Q1 2025 Performance:** Alphabet reported strong Q1 2025 results on April 24, 2025, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year (14% in constant currency). Google Services, Google Search, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud all showed double-digit revenue growth. Operating income increased by 20% to $31 billion, with an operating margin of 33.9%. Net income was $34.5 billion, significantly boosted by an $11.2 billion unrealized gain on non-marketable equity securities. EPS was $2.81, and free cash flow was $19 billion. Capital expenditures were $17.2 billion.
*   **Q2 2024 Performance:** For comparison, Q2 2024 (reported July 23, 2024) saw consolidated revenues of $84.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Operating income was $27.4 billion (32% operating margin), net income was $23.6 billion, EPS was $1.89, and free cash flow was $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $13 billion.
*   **Company Guidance and Trends:**
    *   Management indicated continued strong momentum across the business during the Q1 2025 earnings call, with commentary on the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of 2025.
    *   Alphabet projected full-year 2025 capital expenditures to be around $75 billion, indicating a significant increase in investment in technical infrastructure, particularly for AI and cloud computing.
    *   The company authorized a new $70 billion share repurchase program in Q1 2025, which is expected to reduce shares outstanding over time.
    *   Operating margins have shown expansion, with Q1 2025 benefiting from healthy revenue growth, moderated compensation growth, and a favorable revenue mix, partially offset by increased depreciation.

**Forecast Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:** Based on Q1 2025's 12% year-over-year growth and Q2 2024's 14% growth, I project a 13% year-over-year growth for Q2 2025, reflecting continued strong momentum in Search, Cloud, and YouTube.
    *   Q2 2025 Revenue = Q2 2024 Revenue ($84.7 billion) \* 1.13 = $95.711 billion.
2.  **Operating Income:** Given the operating margin expansion in Q1 2025 (33.9%) and the company's focus on efficiency, I project a slight improvement in operating margin for Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024 (32%). I estimate an operating margin of 33%.
    *   Q2 2025 Operating Income = Q2 2025 Revenue ($95.711 billion) \* 0.33 = $31.58463 billion.
3.  **EBITDA:** I estimate depreciation and amortization (D&A) based on the significant increase in capital expenditures. With full-year 2025 CapEx guided at $75 billion and Q1 2025 CapEx at $17.2 billion, the remaining quarters will see substantial investment. I estimate D&A for Q2 2025 to be approximately $15.8 billion, reflecting the increased asset base.
    *   Q2 2025 EBITDA = Operating Income ($31.58463 billion) + D&A ($15.8 billion) = $47.38463 billion.
4.  **Net Income:** I will normalize Net Income by excluding the one-time $11.2 billion unrealized gain from Q1 2025. Using the projected operating income and an estimated effective tax rate of 18% (consistent with historical trends), and assuming no significant non-recurring items.
    *   Q2 2025 Net Income = Operating Income ($31.58463 billion) \* (1 - 0.18) = $25.9004966 billion.
5.  **Free Cash Flow:** I project Q2 2025 capital expenditures to be around $19 billion, reflecting the accelerated investment pace to meet the $75 billion full-year guidance. Operating cash flow is estimated based on a historical relationship with normalized net income.
    *   Estimated Q2 2025 Operating Cash Flow = Normalized Net Income ($25.9004966 billion) \* 1.2 (a conservative multiplier based on historical trends) = $31.08059592 billion.
    *   Q2 2025 Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow ($31.08059592 billion) - Capital Expenditures ($19 billion) = $12.08059592 billion.
6.  **EPS:** Based on the projected Net Income and an estimated weighted-average shares outstanding of 12.2 billion, reflecting a slight reduction due to the ongoing share repurchase program.
    *   Q2 2025 EPS = Net Income ($25.9004966 billion) / Shares Outstanding (12.2 billion) = $2.12.

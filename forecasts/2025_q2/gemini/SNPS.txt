Here are the financial forecasts for Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) for Q2 2025, based on information available on or before August 26, 2025, specifically drawing from the company's Q1 2025 earnings release and conference call on February 26, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

*   **Revenue and EPS:** Forecasts are based on the midpoints of the guidance ranges provided by Synopsys during its Q1 2025 earnings call for Q2 2025.
*   **Operating Income:** Derived by subtracting the midpoint of the guided GAAP costs and expenses from the midpoint of the guided revenue.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the forecasted GAAP EPS by an estimated diluted shares outstanding. The estimated diluted shares outstanding were derived from Synopsys's Q1 2025 GAAP Net Income and GAAP EPS.
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding back the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses (which includes depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash adjustments) to the GAAP Operating Income. This difference serves as a proxy for D&A and other non-cash items typically added back for EBITDA.

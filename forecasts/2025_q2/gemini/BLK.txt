Here is the forecast for BlackRock (BLK) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information as of July 1, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Rationale:**

*   **Revenue:** BlackRock reported Q1 2025 revenue of $5.28 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, driven by organic base fee growth, market beta impact on Assets Under Management (AUM), and fees from the GIP transaction, as well as a 16% growth in technology services revenue, including the partial impact of the Preqin acquisition. BlackRock's 2025 Midyear Investment Outlook, published on July 1, 2025, indicates a "pro-risk stance" and overweight in U.S. equities, suggesting a positive market environment. I project a modest sequential increase of approximately 2.5% from Q1 2025, reflecting continued organic growth and the full quarter impact of the Preqin acquisition.
*   **Operating Income:** Q1 2025 GAAP operating income was $1.70 billion, with a GAAP operating margin of 32.2%. I will apply a similar operating margin to the projected Q2 revenue to estimate operating income.
*   **EBITDA:** Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) for the full year 2024 was $270 million. For Q1 2025, I estimate D&A to be approximately $75 million, accounting for the full quarter impact of the GIP acquisition (closed Q4 2024) and a partial impact from Preqin (closed March 3, 2025). For Q2 2025, I project D&A to increase slightly to $85 million, reflecting the full quarter impact of both GIP and Preqin. EBITDA is calculated as Operating Income + D&A.
*   **Net Income:** Q1 2025 GAAP net income was $1.51 billion. The Q1 2025 earnings report indicated that GAAP diluted EPS was impacted by acquisition-related costs. The projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2025 is 25% [cite: 1 in previous thought]. I will estimate net non-operating income/expense based on the relationship between Q1 GAAP operating income and GAAP net income, and then apply the 25% tax rate.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Explicit Free Cash Flow figures for Q1 2025 or FY 2024 were not readily available in the provided snippets. Q1 2025 saw a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to the Preqin acquisition and dividend payments [cite: 4 in previous thought]. Given the lack of specific guidance on capital expenditures, I will estimate Free Cash Flow as 70% of projected Net Income, a conservative conversion rate considering potential ongoing integration costs and capital allocation.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Q1 2025 GAAP diluted EPS was $9.64, with implied diluted shares outstanding of approximately 156.6 million. BlackRock repurchased $375 million in shares during Q1 2025 [cite: 4 in previous thought]. I will assume a relatively stable diluted share count of 156 million for Q2 2025, reflecting ongoing share repurchases offsetting any potential new issuances. EPS is calculated by dividing projected Net Income by projected Diluted Shares Outstanding.

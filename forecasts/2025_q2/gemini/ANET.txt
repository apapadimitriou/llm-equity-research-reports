As of July 22, 2025, the company had recently reported strong Q1 2025 financial results and provided insights into its ongoing business momentum.

For the second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2), Arista Networks' financial projections are based on available analyst consensus and historical financial trends, as the company's official Q2 2025 results were not yet released by the forecast date.

**Key Considerations for 2025_Q2 Forecast:**

*   **Q1 2025 Performance:** Arista Networks reported Q1 2025 revenue of $2.005 billion, non-GAAP net income of $826.2 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.65. The company achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 64.1% and generated approximately $641.7 million in cash from operations.
*   **Revenue Growth:** The company continues to benefit from strong demand across AI, cloud, and enterprise sectors.
*   **Share Repurchase Program:** In May 2025, Arista's Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, following significant repurchases in Q1 2025, which will impact diluted share count.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** For the full fiscal year 2025, Arista expects to incur approximately $100 million in capital expenditures for expanded facilities.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** Analyst consensus for Q2 2025 revenue was approximately $2.03 billion, and consensus EPS was $0.67.

**Forecast Methodology:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast uses the analyst consensus revenue estimate for Q2 2025.
*   **EPS:** The forecast utilizes the analyst consensus EPS for Q2 2025.
*   **Net Income:** Derived from the consensus EPS and an estimated diluted share count, reflecting ongoing share repurchases. The estimated diluted shares outstanding for Q2 2025 are projected to be 1.275 billion, a slight reduction from Q1 2025's 1.279 billion due to the active share repurchase program.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated by working backward from the derived Net Income, assuming a consistent effective tax rate and other income similar to Q1 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding an assumed depreciation and amortization (D&A) figure (estimated at 2% of revenue) to the projected Operating Income.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Projected based on an estimated cash flow from operations, considering the slight sequential revenue increase, and subtracting estimated quarterly capital expenditures derived from the full-year 2025 guidance.

As an equity research analyst, I am providing a forecast for Meta Platforms (META) for the second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2). This forecast is based on publicly available information as of July 16, 2025, primarily Meta's Q1 2025 earnings report and the Q2 2025 guidance provided during the Q1 2025 earnings call on April 30, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Meta Platforms provided guidance for Q2 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. I have used the midpoint of this guidance for the forecast.
*   **Operating Income:** Based on Meta's Q1 2025 operating margin of 41% (Operating Income of $17.555 billion on revenue of $42.31 billion), I applied this margin to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **Net Income:** Using the Q1 2025 net income margin of approximately 39.34% (Net Income of $16.644 billion on revenue of $42.31 billion), I applied this margin to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2025 were derived from the reported Net Income of $16.644 billion and Diluted EPS of $6.43, resulting in approximately 2,588,491,446 shares. This share count is assumed to remain consistent for Q2 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, I first estimated a D&A component for Q1 2025. Assuming D&A is approximately 10% of Q1 2025 revenue ($4.231 billion), Q1 EBITDA would be Operating Income ($17.555 billion) plus this estimated D&A, totaling $21.786 billion. This implies an EBITDA margin of approximately 51.49% for Q1 2025. This margin was then applied to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Based on Meta's Q1 2025 free cash flow of $10.33 billion on revenue of $42.31 billion, a free cash flow margin of approximately 24.41% was calculated and applied to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue.

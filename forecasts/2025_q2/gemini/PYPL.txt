Here are the financial forecasts for PayPal (PYPL) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 15, 2025. The forecasts are derived from PayPal's Q1 2025 earnings report and associated guidance released on April 29, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Q2 2025 revenue is projected by applying the Q1 2025 transaction margin percentage (47.7%) to the midpoint of PayPal's Q2 2025 transaction margin dollars guidance ($3,775 million).
*   **EPS (GAAP):** The forecast uses the midpoint of PayPal's official GAAP EPS guidance for Q2 2025 ($1.24 - $1.26).
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the forecasted GAAP EPS by the diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2025 (979 million).
*   **Operating Income:** Derived by applying the Q1 2025 GAAP operating margin (19.6%) to the projected Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding an assumed depreciation and amortization (D&A) to the projected operating income. D&A is estimated at 3% of projected revenue, a reasonable approximation for a technology company in the absence of specific guidance.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Projected by applying the Q1 2025 adjusted free cash flow margin (17.7%) to the projected Q2 2025 revenue. This approach aligns with the company's full-year free cash flow guidance of $6-7 billion, implying a ramp-up from Q1 performance.

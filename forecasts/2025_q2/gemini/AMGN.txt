*   **2025 Full Year Guidance (as of Q1 2025 earnings call):** Total Revenues in the range of $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion (midpoint $35.0 billion), Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $20.00 to $21.20 (midpoint $20.60), GAAP EPS in the range of $12.21 to $13.46 (midpoint $12.835), Non-GAAP Operating Margin of approximately 46%, and Free Cash Flow roughly comparable to 2023 ($10.4 billion).
*   **2024 Q2 Actuals:** Revenue of $8.4 billion, GAAP EPS of $1.38, Non-GAAP EPS of $4.97, GAAP Operating Income of $1.9 billion, and Non-GAAP Operating Income of $3.9 billion.
*   **Share Count:** Approximately 541 million shares (derived from 2024 and Q1 2025 Net Income and GAAP EPS).

**Forecasting Methodology for 2025_Q2:**

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2025 revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Applying a similar year-over-year growth rate to Q2 2024 revenue ($8.4 billion) yields a projection for Q2 2025.
    *   $8,400,000,000 * 1.09 = $9,156,000,000.
*   **EPS (GAAP):** Given the volatility of GAAP EPS due to one-time items (e.g., Q1 2025 unrealized gain and impairment charge), a direct growth rate from Q1 is not ideal. Instead, we consider the full-year GAAP EPS guidance midpoint ($12.835) and subtract Q1 actuals ($3.20), leaving $9.635 for the remaining three quarters. Assuming a conservative distribution, and considering Q2 2024 GAAP EPS of $1.38, a modest increase of approximately 10% from Q2 2024 is applied to account for overall business growth, resulting in $1.38 * 1.10 = $1.518.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the projected GAAP EPS by the estimated shares outstanding (541 million).
    *   $1.518 * 541,000,000 = $821,178,000.
*   **Operating Income (GAAP):** Q2 2024 GAAP Operating Income was $1.9 billion. Applying a conservative growth rate of 5% (less than revenue growth due to potential ongoing GAAP adjustments) yields a projection for Q2 2025.
    *   $1,900,000,000 * 1.05 = $1,995,000,000.
*   **EBITDA:** Derived from the projected GAAP Operating Income by adding back an estimated average quarterly depreciation and amortization and other non-operating adjustments. Using the full-year 2024 relationship where EBITDA ($13.36 billion) was approximately 1.83 times GAAP Operating Income ($7.3 billion) is one approach. However, given the significant difference between GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Income, using the relationship between Non-GAAP Operating Income and EBITDA is more consistent. For FY2024, EBITDA ($13.36 billion) was approximately 0.89 times Non-GAAP Operating Income ($15.0 billion). Applying this ratio to the projected Q2 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income (calculated as 46% of projected revenue: $9.156 billion * 0.46 = $4.21176 billion) yields:
    *   $4,211,760,000 * 0.89 = $3,748,466,400.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Full-year 2025 FCF is guided to be comparable to 2023 ($10.4 billion). Q1 2025 FCF was $1.0 billion. The Q1 2025 earnings call explicitly stated that Q2 FCF would be impacted by the shift in 2024 tax payments and a final $1.8 billion repatriation tax payment. This suggests a significant negative impact. Therefore, a conservative estimate for Q2 FCF, lower than an even distribution of the remaining full-year FCF, is warranted.

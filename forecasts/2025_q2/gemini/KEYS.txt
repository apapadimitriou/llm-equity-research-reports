Keysight Technologies (KEYS) reported strong financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2025. As an analyst on August 5, 2025, these results would have already been publicly available. The company exceeded its own guidance for both revenue and earnings per share, demonstrating solid execution and customer engagement.

For the second fiscal quarter of 2025:
*   **Revenue** was reported at $1.31 billion.
*   **Net Income (GAAP)** was $257 million.
*   **Free Cash Flow** saw a significant increase, reaching $457 million.
*   **Diluted EPS (GAAP)** was $1.49 per share.

To derive Operating Income, Keysight reported an operating margin of 25% for Q2 2025.
*   **Operating Income** = Revenue \* Operating Margin = $1,310,000,000 \* 0.25 = $327,500,000.

For EBITDA, which is Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization (D&A), the company's Q2 2025 earnings report indicated depreciation of $64 million for the six months ended April 30, 2025. Given that the depreciation for the three months ended April 30, 2024 (Q2 2024) was $62 million, and a specific quarterly figure for Q2 2025 was not separately detailed, we will use the Q2 2024 depreciation figure as a reasonable proxy for Q2 2025 D&A to estimate EBITDA.
*   **EBITDA** = Operating Income + Estimated D&A = $327,500,000 + $62,000,000 = $389,500,000.

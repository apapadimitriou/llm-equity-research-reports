**Forecasting Methodology:**

The forecasts are based on Medtronic's fiscal year 2025 (FY25) guidance provided during its Q4 FY2024 earnings call on May 23, 2024, as well as historical financial trends and seasonality. Medtronic's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in April, meaning FY25 Q2 corresponds to the calendar quarter ending October 2024.

*   **Revenue:** Medtronic guided for FY2025 reported revenue growth in the range of 2.4% to 3.7%, with revenue growth expected to accelerate through the quarters. Q2 FY2024 revenue was $7.984 billion. Assuming a reported growth rate of 3.5% for Q2 FY2025, reflecting the expected acceleration within the full-year guidance range.
*   **Operating Income & EBITDA:** The company anticipated operating margin expansion for FY2025. Using the implied FY2025 annual operating and EBITDA margins derived from full-year estimates and applying a slightly conservative quarterly margin to the forecasted Q2 revenue.
*   **Net Income & EPS:** Medtronic provided FY2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $5.40 to $5.50. Q2 FY2024 non-GAAP EPS was $1.25. By calculating Q2 FY2024 EPS as a percentage of the FY2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance midpoint and applying this proportion to the FY2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance midpoint, we derive the Q2 FY2025 EPS. Net Income is then calculated using this EPS and an estimated stable diluted share count.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** FY2025 annual free cash flow was estimated at $5.18 billion. Q2 free cash flow is estimated by applying the historical Q2 revenue proportion of annual revenue to the forecasted annual free cash flow.

## Analyst Note

Fidelity National Information Services continues to demonstrate strategic focus and operational discipline following its portfolio optimization efforts over the past year. The company's first quarter 2025 results exceeded expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 surpassing analyst estimates by $0.01 and representing an 11% year-over-year increase[1][3]. Revenue reached $2.5 billion, reflecting 4% growth compared to the prior year, with the Banking Solutions segment contributing $1.72 billion and Capital Market Solutions adding $764 million[1]. Most significantly, recurring revenue growth accelerated to 4% from previous levels of 2%, with recurring revenue now representing 81% of total sales, demonstrating the strength and predictability of FIS' business model[9].

The transformative acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business for $13.5 billion enterprise value, coupled with the $6.6 billion sale of 45% of its Worldpay stake, represents a strategic repositioning that replaces non-cash generating minority interest with growing recurring revenues, EBITDA, and free cash flow[5]. This transaction is expected to drive more than $150 million in net EBITDA synergies within three years and provide over $500 million in additional adjusted free cash flow within the first 12 months post-closing[13]. The deal enhances FIS' value proposition to large banks and corporates by combining best-in-class credit capabilities at scale with existing banking solutions, unlocking significant cross-selling opportunities across the client base.

Management maintains confidence in the business trajectory, reaffirming full-year 2025 outlook for adjusted revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS despite some near-term integration complexities. The company continues to see strong demand for core banking solutions modernization, with an active pipeline of opportunities expected to close in the second quarter. CEO Stephanie Ferris emphasized the company's positioning in money movement strategy, noting continued momentum in core wins and growing traction in digital solutions as banks modernize branch teller technologies and corporate clients seek to centralize payment processing capabilities.

## Business Description

Fidelity National Information Services operates as a leading American multinational corporation specializing in financial technology solutions, serving over 20,000 clients globally including banks, asset managers, and businesses[1]. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, the company has evolved from its origins as Systematics in 1968 to become one of the world's largest financial technology providers, facilitating the movement of approximately $9 trillion through the processing of roughly 75 billion transactions annually[11]. The company was ranked second in the FinTech Forward 2016 rankings and became the largest processing and payments company globally following its acquisition of Worldpay for $35 billion in 2019, though it subsequently sold a majority stake in that business to optimize its portfolio focus[11].

FIS operates through two primary business segments that collectively generated $9.87 billion in revenue for 2024[12]. The Banking Solutions segment represents the largest portion of the business at $6.89 billion or 69.8% of total revenue, providing comprehensive core processing and ancillary services to banks along with digital banking platforms and lending solutions[12]. This segment encompasses core banking applications, wealth and retirement solutions, and the complete lending lifecycle from origination to servicing and collections[8]. The Capital Market Solutions segment contributed $2.98 billion or 30.2% of total revenue, offering record-keeping and other services to investment firms, asset management solutions, and institutional wholesale services[12].

The company's geographic footprint spans 33 countries with operations concentrated in North America, which accounts for $7.85 billion or 77.5% of total revenue, while non-North American markets contribute $2.28 billion or 22.5% of revenue[12]. This global presence allows FIS to serve financial institutions ranging from community banks to the largest global institutions, providing scalable solutions for enterprises with annual revenues from $50 million to $50 billion[7]. The company's technology infrastructure supports integration across more than 10,000 financial institutions worldwide, with cloud-based platforms and API-driven integration capabilities that enable customization for 87% of core banking platforms[7].

## Business Strategy & Outlook

FIS has articulated a clear strategic vision centered on its "Money Movement" strategy, which encompasses both "Money at Rest" and "Money in Motion" components that leverage the company's comprehensive financial technology capabilities. The Money at Rest strategy focuses on core banking solutions where FIS continues to see strong demand driven by financial institutions' need to modernize legacy systems and improve operational efficiency. This segment benefits from ongoing consolidation in the financial services sector, creating opportunities for FIS to capture market share as smaller technology providers struggle to compete with the scale and breadth of FIS' offerings. The company maintains an active pipeline of core banking opportunities and expects momentum to continue through the second quarter of 2025 and beyond[9].

The Money in Motion strategy addresses the growing demand for payment processing, digital solutions, and treasury management services as corporate clients seek to centralize, standardize, and optimize their payment operations. FIS' digital solutions continue to gain market traction, particularly as banks modernize branch teller technologies and implement next-generation customer engagement platforms. The company's Treasury Management International 2025 Innovation & Excellence awards recognition for outstanding achievements in cash and treasury management, as well as artificial intelligence innovation, demonstrates the market's acknowledgment of FIS' technological leadership in this space[4].

The pending acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business represents a strategic inflection point that significantly enhances FIS' competitive positioning in the credit processing market. This transaction adds best-in-class credit capabilities at scale to complement FIS' existing debit, loyalty, and network services, creating a more comprehensive value proposition for large banks and corporate clients[5]. The integration is expected to unlock substantial cross-selling opportunities across FIS' existing client base, with management projecting incremental revenue synergies of $45 million initially, expanding to at least $125 million in the longer term[13]. The combination positions FIS uniquely in the market by offering both core banking infrastructure and comprehensive payment processing capabilities under a single platform.

Looking toward the medium-term outlook, FIS is well-positioned to benefit from several secular trends driving demand for financial technology solutions. The ongoing digital transformation of financial services continues to create opportunities for modernization projects, while regulatory requirements and cybersecurity concerns drive institutions to partner with established technology providers that can offer comprehensive compliance and risk management capabilities. The company's investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, evidenced by recent innovation awards, position it to capture value from the increasing automation of financial processes and enhanced fraud detection capabilities.

## Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say**: The bull case for FIS centers on the company's dominant market position in mission-critical financial infrastructure that creates significant switching costs and recurring revenue stability. With 81% of revenue classified as recurring, FIS offers investors predictable cash flows that are less susceptible to economic cycles than many technology companies[9]. The acceleration of recurring revenue growth to 4% from previous levels of 2% demonstrates the underlying strength of client relationships and the stickiness of FIS' core banking and payment processing solutions. The pending acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business represents a transformative opportunity to enhance the company's competitive moat by adding credit processing capabilities that complement existing offerings and create significant cross-selling opportunities with large banking clients.

Management's track record of successful portfolio optimization, demonstrated through the strategic divestiture of the majority Worldpay stake, shows disciplined capital allocation focused on maximizing shareholder value. The $6.6 billion proceeds from the Worldpay sale, representing a multiple of approximately 10.5 times expected 2025 EBITDA, provides substantial financial flexibility for growth investments and debt reduction[5]. The company's strong free cash flow generation, expected to increase by over $500 million within 12 months post-closing of the acquisition, supports both growth investments and enhanced shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.

The secular trend toward financial technology adoption continues to drive demand for FIS' solutions, particularly as smaller financial institutions seek to modernize legacy systems and compete with larger peers. The company's comprehensive product suite, spanning core banking, payment processing, and capital markets solutions, positions it as a one-stop provider for financial institutions' technology needs. Recent recognition through industry awards and the successful launch of new platforms, such as the Securities Finance Matching Platform in the U.S., demonstrates FIS' continued innovation leadership and market relevance.

**Bears Say**: The bear case for FIS reflects concerns about the company's ability to accelerate growth in an increasingly competitive financial technology landscape while managing the integration risks associated with large acquisitions. The company's revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter, while solid, remains modest compared to faster-growing fintech competitors and may not justify the premium valuation multiple[3]. The Banking Solutions segment, which represents nearly 70% of total revenue, showed growth of only 2% in the first quarter, raising questions about the sustainability of demand for core banking modernization projects[12].

The $13.5 billion acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business significantly increases FIS' debt burden, with pro forma gross leverage expected to reach approximately 3.4 times, requiring 18 months to reduce to the company's target of 2.8 times[13]. This elevated leverage constrains financial flexibility and forces management to temporarily pause share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions, potentially limiting the company's ability to capitalize on other strategic opportunities. The acquisition's success depends heavily on achieving projected synergies and successfully integrating complex technology platforms, which carries execution risk given the scale and complexity of the transaction.

Competitive pressures in the financial technology sector continue to intensify as cloud-native fintech startups offer more agile and cost-effective solutions compared to FIS' legacy infrastructure. Large technology companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are increasingly targeting the financial services sector with competitive offerings that could pressure FIS' market share and pricing power over time. The company's dependence on the banking sector, which faces ongoing consolidation and margin pressure, creates concentration risk that could impact FIS' growth prospects if client spending on technology initiatives slows.

## Economic Moat

FIS maintains a narrow economic moat based primarily on switching costs and network effects that create competitive advantages in its core markets. The company's position as a provider of mission-critical financial infrastructure creates substantial switching costs for clients, as changing core banking systems or payment processing platforms requires significant time, resources, and operational risk that most financial institutions prefer to avoid. These switching costs are particularly pronounced in the core banking segment, where FIS' systems process daily transaction volumes and maintain customer account data that would be extremely disruptive and expensive to migrate to alternative providers.

The network effects component of FIS' moat derives from the company's scale in payment processing and the interconnected nature of financial systems. As more financial institutions and merchants utilize FIS' payment processing capabilities, the network becomes more valuable for all participants due to increased connectivity and reduced transaction costs. The company's processing of approximately 75 billion transactions annually creates data insights and operational efficiencies that smaller competitors struggle to replicate[11]. This scale advantage allows FIS to invest in advanced fraud detection, artificial intelligence capabilities, and cybersecurity measures that individual financial institutions could not develop independently.

However, FIS' economic moat faces ongoing pressure from technological disruption and changing client preferences. Cloud-native fintech solutions offer increased flexibility and faster implementation compared to FIS' legacy infrastructure, potentially reducing switching costs for some client segments. The rise of application programming interfaces (APIs) and modular banking architectures enables financial institutions to adopt best-of-breed solutions from multiple vendors rather than relying on comprehensive platforms from single providers like FIS. This trend could gradually erode the switching costs that form a key component of the company's competitive advantages.

The pending acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business has the potential to strengthen FIS' economic moat by adding credit processing capabilities that complement existing debit and payment services. This combination creates a more comprehensive value proposition that increases switching costs by expanding the number of systems and processes that clients would need to replace when considering alternatives. The enhanced cross-selling opportunities resulting from the broader product portfolio could deepen client relationships and further reinforce the competitive moat through increased integration and dependency.

## Fair Value and Profit Drivers

FIS' fair value estimate of $87.00 per share reflects a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the company's stable recurring revenue base, expected synergies from the pending acquisition, and normalized growth assumptions for the financial technology sector. The valuation model assumes a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5-6% over the next five years, driven by organic growth in existing segments plus incremental revenue from the acquired Issuer Solutions business. This growth rate reflects the company's positioning in mission-critical financial infrastructure with strong client retention, offset by competitive pressures and market maturation in certain segments.

Margin expansion represents a key profit driver, with the company targeting improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins through operational efficiencies and synergies from the Global Payments acquisition. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA margins, adjusted EPS, and adjusted free cash flow within the first 12 months, with net EBITDA synergies exceeding $150 million by year three[5]. These synergies primarily result from technology platform consolidation, elimination of duplicate functions, and enhanced pricing power through the expanded product portfolio. Management's track record of achieving cost synergies from previous acquisitions, including the successful integration of Worldpay, supports confidence in the realization of projected benefits.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) assumption of approximately 8-9% reflects FIS' investment-grade credit profile despite temporarily elevated leverage from the acquisition financing. The company's stable cash flows and strong market position support access to favorable financing terms, while the recurring nature of revenue reduces business risk compared to more cyclical technology companies. Free cash flow generation is expected to strengthen significantly following the acquisition closing, with management projecting over $500 million in additional adjusted free cash flow within 12 months[13].

Earnings per share growth is projected to accelerate from current levels as acquisition synergies materialize and the company benefits from the enhanced scale and competitive positioning. The EPS bridge reflects organic growth in existing segments, contribution from the acquired business, realization of cost and revenue synergies, and the impact of share repurchases once the company reduces leverage to target levels. Based on these assumptions, the fair value estimate implies trading multiples of approximately 15-16 times forward earnings and 3.5-4.0 times revenue, which appears reasonable given the company's market position and growth prospects.

## Risk & Uncertainty

Macroeconomic risks represent a significant factor in FIS' outlook, as the company's financial institution clients are sensitive to interest rate changes, credit conditions, and overall economic stability. Rising interest rates can pressure bank net interest margins and reduce loan origination volumes, potentially leading to decreased spending on technology initiatives and delayed modernization projects. Economic downturns historically correlate with reduced client technology spending as financial institutions focus on preserving capital and managing credit losses rather than investing in growth initiatives.

Regulatory risks encompass both direct regulation of FIS' operations and indirect effects from banking sector regulation that impacts client demand. The financial technology sector faces increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding data privacy, cybersecurity standards, and systemic risk considerations. Enhanced regulatory requirements could increase compliance costs and limit the company's ability to innovate or expand into new markets. Additionally, changes in banking regulations, such as capital requirements or stress testing standards, can influence client technology spending priorities and investment timing.

Integration risk from the pending Global Payments acquisition represents a near-term uncertainty that could significantly impact financial performance and strategic positioning. The $13.5 billion transaction involves combining complex technology platforms, integrating diverse client bases, and achieving substantial cost and revenue synergies within aggressive timeframes[5]. Historical precedent suggests that large technology acquisitions often face delays, cost overruns, and lower-than-expected synergy realization, which could pressure FIS' financial metrics and strategic objectives. The company's temporary elevation in leverage to 3.4 times gross debt-to-EBITDA creates additional pressure to execute the integration successfully and achieve deleveraging targets.

Cybersecurity threats pose ongoing operational and reputational risks given FIS' role in processing sensitive financial data and facilitating critical payment infrastructure. Successful cyberattacks could result in significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and client defections that would have lasting impact on the business. The company's investment of $672 million in cybersecurity infrastructure in 2023 demonstrates management's recognition of these risks, but the evolving threat landscape requires continuous investment and vigilance[7]. Competition from both established technology companies and emerging fintech startups creates market share and pricing pressure risks that could limit FIS' growth prospects and profitability over time.

## Capital Allocation

FIS demonstrates a balanced approach to capital allocation that prioritizes both growth investments and shareholder returns while maintaining financial flexibility for strategic opportunities. The company's existing capital allocation priorities for 2025 include up to $1 billion in merger and acquisition spending and $1.2 billion in share repurchases, demonstrating management's confidence in the business outlook and commitment to returning cash to shareholders[5]. The dividend policy maintains annual per-share growth consistent with adjusted EPS growth, providing income-oriented investors with predictable returns that grow alongside business performance.

Balance sheet strength remains solid despite the temporary elevation in leverage from the pending acquisition financing. The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.72 prior to the transaction indicates reasonable financial leverage, while the pro forma gross leverage of approximately 3.4 times following the acquisition closing remains within acceptable ranges for investment-grade companies in the technology sector[4][13]. Management's commitment to reduce leverage to the target level of 2.8 times within 18 months demonstrates discipline and focus on maintaining financial flexibility for future opportunities.

The strategic divestiture of the Worldpay stake exemplifies disciplined capital allocation focused on optimizing portfolio composition and maximizing shareholder value. The $6.6 billion sale price represents a multiple of approximately 10.5 times expected 2025 EBITDA, providing substantial proceeds while eliminating non-cash generating minority interest[5]. These proceeds, combined with the enhanced cash flow generation from the acquired Issuer Solutions business, provide significant financial resources for debt reduction, growth investments, and resumed shareholder returns once leverage targets are achieved.

Post-closing the acquisition, management plans to temporarily pause share repurchases and tuck-in M&A activities to accelerate deleveraging, demonstrating appropriate prioritization of balance sheet strength over near-term shareholder returns. This conservative approach should facilitate achievement of target leverage ratios and position the company to resume normal capital allocation activities from a position of financial strength. The company's strong free cash flow generation, expected to increase by over $500 million within 12 months of acquisition closing, supports confidence in the ability to service debt obligations while maintaining investment in growth initiatives and eventual return to enhanced shareholder returns.

| Metric | 2022A | 2023A | 2024A | 2025E | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Revenue ($B) | 9.7 | 9.8 | 10.1 | 10.5 | 12.8 | 13.5 | 14.2 | 14.9 |
| Op Margin % | 13.2 | 13.8 | 14.1 | 14.5 | 16.2 | 17.8 | 18.5 | 19.1 |
| EPS ($) | 5.22 | 5.45 | 5.52 | 5.75 | 7.12 | 7.89 | 8.45 | 9.02 |
| FCF ($B) | 2.8 | 3.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 4.9 | 5.4 | 5.8 | 6.2 |
| ROIC % | 8.5 | 9.2 | 9.8 | 10.3 | 11.8 | 12.5 | 13.1 | 13.6 |

The financial snapshot reflects FIS' historical performance and projected trajectory incorporating the pending acquisition of Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business. Revenue growth accelerates beginning in 2026 following the expected transaction closing, with the acquired business contributing approximately $2.5-3.0 billion in annual revenue based on its scale and market position. Operating margin expansion reflects both organic efficiency improvements and substantial synergies from the combination, with management targeting net EBITDA synergies exceeding $150 million by year three[13].

Earnings per share growth demonstrates the accretive nature of the transaction, with projections showing acceleration from current levels as synergies materialize and the company benefits from enhanced scale and competitive positioning. Free cash flow strengthens significantly due to both organic growth and the high cash generation characteristics of the acquired business, with management projecting over $500 million in additional adjusted free cash flow within the first 12 months post-closing[13]. Return on invested capital improvements reflect the efficient deployment of acquisition capital and successful realization of projected synergies.

## ESG Risk

FIS maintains a medium ESG risk rating reflecting both the company's proactive approach to environmental and social initiatives and the inherent risks associated with operating critical financial infrastructure. The company announced an ambitious climate action plan in 2021 with goals to achieve 100% carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, source 100% renewable energy by 2025, and secure validation of Science-Based Targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions[17]. Over the past five years, FIS reduced its emissions, energy, and water usage by approximately 30% through facility consolidation, including data center optimization, demonstrating tangible progress toward sustainability objectives.

Social responsibility initiatives focus on diversity and inclusion, community engagement, and responsible technology development. CEO Stephanie Ferris' recognition on multiple industry lists, including the CNBC Changemakers list of Women Transforming Business in 2025 and American Banker's Most Influential Women in Fintech 2024, reflects the company's commitment to diverse leadership[16]. The company's role in facilitating financial inclusion through technology solutions that serve underbanked populations and enable access to financial services represents a positive social impact component of its business model.

Governance considerations include board composition, executive compensation alignment, and oversight of cybersecurity and operational risks. The company's Executive Management team and Board of Directors have established ESG as a top priority with direct accountability for sustainability initiatives and progress reporting[17]. However, the critical nature of FIS' financial infrastructure creates governance risks related to system reliability, data protection, and regulatory compliance that require ongoing attention and investment. The company's investment of $672 million in cybersecurity infrastructure in 2023 demonstrates recognition of these governance obligations[7].

Peer comparison within the financial technology sector shows FIS performing reasonably well on ESG metrics, though there remains room for improvement relative to leading ESG performers in the technology sector more broadly. The company's annual sustainability reporting and independent validation of achievements provide transparency and accountability for ESG progress. Material ESG issues for ongoing monitoring include cybersecurity incident response, data privacy protection, climate transition planning, and workforce diversity metrics as the company integrates the acquired Global Payments business and continues to scale its operations globally.

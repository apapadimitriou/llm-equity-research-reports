### Analyst Note

Goldman Sachs reported robust second quarter 2025 results that underscored the firm's ability to capitalize on improving market conditions. Earnings per share of $10.91 significantly exceeded the $9.82 consensus estimate, while revenue of $14.58 billion grew 14.5% year-over-year and surpassed expectations by $1.05 billion[2]. The strong performance was driven by continued momentum in the Global Banking & Markets division, which benefited from increased client activity across trading and investment banking services.

The firm's strategic repositioning continues to bear fruit, with management successfully executing on its plan to focus on higher-return businesses while maintaining market leadership positions. Asset & Wealth Management generated record management fees in 2024, with assets under supervision reaching $3.14 trillion[4]. Investment banking revenues of $7.73 billion in 2024 represented a 24% increase from the prior year, supported by the firm's #1 ranking in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions[6].

Goldman's capital position remains robust, with return on equity of 12.7% in 2024 demonstrating strong profitability metrics[6]. The firm's dividend yield of 1.89% provides income support while maintaining flexibility for capital deployment[13]. However, shares trade at a premium to our fair value estimate, reflecting optimistic expectations for continued execution in a challenging operating environment.

### Business Description

The Goldman Sachs Group operates as a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm serving corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. Founded in 1869 and headquartered in New York, the firm conducts business through two primary segments: Global Banking & Markets, and Asset & Wealth Management[8].

Global Banking & Markets encompasses the firm's investment banking, trading, and market-making activities. This division generated $34.94 billion in net revenues in 2024, representing the largest portion of firm-wide revenues[6]. Services include financial advisory, debt and equity underwriting, and client execution across fixed income, currency, commodities, and equities markets.

Asset & Wealth Management provides investment management services to institutional and individual clients, generating $16.14 billion in net revenues in 2024[6]. The division manages $3.14 trillion in assets under supervision across traditional and alternative investment strategies[4]. The firm serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and institutional investors through comprehensive wealth management and private banking services.

### Business Strategy & Outlook

Goldman Sachs is executing a strategic transformation focused on enhancing the durability and profitability of its business model. The firm has successfully grown revenues by nearly 50% over the past five years while strengthening its competitive position across core franchises[1]. This growth reflects deliberate investments in technology, talent, and client relationships that have expanded market share in key segments.

The investment banking franchise remains the firm's crown jewel, with Goldman maintaining its #1 global ranking in announced and completed M&A transactions[6]. This leadership position reflects deep client relationships, sector expertise, and execution capabilities that create sustainable competitive advantages. The firm's strong performance in debt and equity underwriting further demonstrates its ability to capture market share during favorable conditions.

Asset & Wealth Management represents a strategic growth area with more predictable revenue streams and attractive margins. The division's record management fees reflect successful fundraising across alternative investment strategies, with $72 billion raised in 2024 cementing Goldman's position as a top-five global alternative asset manager[4]. Continued focus on ultra-high-net-worth clients and institutional mandates should drive steady growth in assets under management and fee revenues.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say**: Goldman Sachs benefits from an improving operating environment with rising CEO confidence and increased M&A activity driving investment banking revenues. The firm's market leadership positions across core businesses provide competitive moats that generate sustainable returns. Strong capital generation supports both dividend growth and share repurchases, creating value for shareholders. The strategic focus on Asset & Wealth Management reduces earnings volatility while expanding fee-based revenues.

**Bears Say**: Goldman faces headwinds from increased regulatory scrutiny requiring substantial compliance investments that pressure operating margins[16]. The firm's heavy exposure to capital markets makes it vulnerable to economic downturns and market volatility. Competition from both traditional rivals and fintech disruptors threatens fee compression across key business lines. Regulatory constraints on proprietary trading and lending activities limit revenue diversification opportunities compared to universal banking peers.

### Economic Moat

Goldman Sachs possesses a narrow economic moat derived primarily from intangible assets and switching costs within its core investment banking franchise. The firm's century-plus brand recognition, deep client relationships, and regulatory licenses create meaningful barriers to entry in high-value advisory and underwriting mandates. These advantages are particularly pronounced in complex cross-border transactions where Goldman's global presence and sector expertise command premium pricing.

The investment banking moat is reinforced by network effects, as the firm's role in major transactions enhances its visibility and credibility for future mandates. However, this moat faces pressure from increased competition and fee compression in certain segments. The Asset & Wealth Management division benefits from similar relationship-based advantages, though with less pronounced competitive differentiation compared to specialized asset managers.

Scale economies in trading and market-making activities provide additional defensive characteristics, though regulatory changes have reduced the profitability and scope of these businesses. Overall, Goldman's moat remains intact but requires continuous investment in technology and talent to maintain competitive positioning.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our fair value estimate of $650 per share reflects a sum-of-the-parts valuation approach recognizing the distinct characteristics of Goldman's business segments. The Global Banking & Markets division supports the majority of intrinsic value based on normalized earnings power across market cycles. We project revenue CAGR of 4-6% over the medium term, driven by modest market share gains and GDP-linked growth in client activity.

Operating margins should benefit from operating leverage as the firm scales its technology investments and compliance infrastructure. We estimate normalized return on equity of 12-14%, in line with historical performance and management targets. Our weighted average cost of capital assumption of 8.5% reflects the firm's strong capital position and reduced regulatory uncertainty.

Key profit drivers include investment banking fee growth tied to M&A and capital markets activity, trading revenue supported by market volatility and client flow, and Asset & Wealth Management fee expansion from net inflows and market appreciation. Earnings per share should grow at a mid-to-high single-digit pace supported by modest share count reduction from ongoing repurchase programs.

### Risk & Uncertainty

Goldman Sachs faces multiple risk factors that could materially impact valuation. Regulatory risks remain elevated given ongoing scrutiny from banking supervisors and the SEC's focus on compliance procedures[16][20]. The firm continues investing hundreds of millions in compliance infrastructure, pressuring near-term profitability while reducing operational flexibility.

Market risks include exposure to trading losses, credit deterioration, and reduced client activity during economic downturns. The firm's capital markets focus creates earnings volatility that exceeds universal banking peers with more diversified revenue streams. Interest rate risk affects both trading positions and the relative attractiveness of different business lines.

Operational risks encompass technology failures, cybersecurity breaches, and key personnel retention in competitive talent markets. ESG-related risks include potential reputational damage from financing activities and regulatory changes affecting sustainable finance initiatives[12]. The firm's $750 billion sustainable finance commitment by 2030 creates execution risks if market conditions deteriorate.

### Capital Allocation

Goldman Sachs maintains an above-average capital allocation rating based on strong balance sheet management and shareholder-friendly policies. The firm's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio provides substantial regulatory buffer while supporting business growth initiatives. Management has demonstrated disciplined M&A approach, focusing on strategic acquisitions that enhance core capabilities rather than transformational deals.

The dividend policy reflects commitment to sustainable, growing payments with a current yield of 1.89%[13]. The recent increase from $2.50 to $2.75 per share demonstrates confidence in earnings stability[19]. The $30 billion share repurchase program provides additional capital return flexibility while maintaining investment capacity for strategic priorities.

Balance sheet strength enables opportunistic market-making and lending activities that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The firm's funding profile benefits from diversified deposit base through Marcus platform, reducing wholesale funding dependence. Overall capital allocation balances growth investment, regulatory requirements, and shareholder returns effectively.

### ESG Risk

Goldman Sachs faces medium ESG risk based on its role as a major financial institution with exposure to environmental, social, and governance challenges. The firm received SEC charges in 2022 for ESG-related compliance failures involving mutual fund policies and procedures[20]. While the $4 million penalty was relatively modest, it highlighted the importance of robust ESG governance frameworks.

Environmental risks center on the firm's financing activities and climate transition exposure. Goldman's commitment to deliver $750 billion in sustainable financing by 2030 demonstrates strategic alignment with ESG trends but creates execution risks[12]. The firm's involvement in fossil fuel financing continues to attract scrutiny from environmental advocates and ESG-focused investors.

Social considerations include diversity and inclusion initiatives, community development investments, and fair lending practices. Governance risks encompass executive compensation, board independence, and regulatory compliance. The firm's ongoing compliance department expansion reflects management recognition of governance importance[16]. Overall ESG risk appears manageable given Goldman's resources and strategic focus on sustainable finance initiatives.

# S&P Global Inc. - Resilient Growth Platform Positioned for Long-Term Value Creation

S&P Global emerges as a compelling investment opportunity in the financial data and analytics space, demonstrating remarkable resilience through its diversified revenue streams and dominant market positions. The company's strong Q2 2025 performance, with revenue growing 6% to $3.76 billion and earnings per share of $4.43 beating consensus estimates by $0.25, underscores the strength of its essential intelligence platform[11][13]. With new leadership under CEO Martina Cheung driving strategic focus through the planned Mobility segment spinoff, S&P Global is well-positioned to capitalize on secular tailwinds in data analytics, ESG investing, and digital transformation across global capital markets. The company's wide economic moat, built through decades of establishing trusted benchmarks like the S&P 500 index and maintaining duopoly status in credit ratings, provides sustainable competitive advantages that support our constructive investment thesis.

## Analyst Note

S&P Global delivered solid Q2 2025 results that reinforce our positive investment thesis, with revenue growing 6% year-over-year to $3.76 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.43 exceeding consensus estimates by $0.25[11][13]. The performance demonstrates the resilience of the company's diversified revenue model, particularly given the challenging macroeconomic environment that has pressured bond issuance volumes in the Ratings segment.

The recent leadership transition to CEO Martina Cheung, effective November 1, 2024, brings fresh strategic focus to the organization[17][19]. Cheung's decision to spin off the Mobility segment into a standalone public company represents a significant strategic move that will allow S&P Global to concentrate resources on its four core, highly synergistic businesses: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, and Indices[9]. This separation is expected to drive enhanced operational efficiency and clearer investment positioning.

Our constructive view is underpinned by several structural advantages. S&P Global's wide economic moat stems from powerful intangible assets, including the globally recognized S&P 500 benchmark and established credit rating methodologies that create significant switching costs for institutional clients[10]. The company benefits from strong network effects, where the value of its platforms increases as more participants utilize its data and analytics services.

The successful integration of IHS Markit continues to generate meaningful synergies, enhancing S&P Global's data capabilities across commodity markets and expanding cross-selling opportunities[6]. With analyst consensus pointing to 12.28% upside potential to an average price target of $586.62, we view current valuation levels as attractive for long-term investors seeking exposure to essential financial infrastructure[2].

Key risks include continued weakness in debt issuance markets, regulatory scrutiny of rating agencies, and execution challenges related to the Mobility spinoff. However, the company's track record of navigating market cycles and maintaining pricing power across its diversified platform supports our favorable outlook.

## Business Description

S&P Global Inc. operates as a leading provider of essential intelligence that enables critical decision-making across global capital and commodity markets[1][4]. Headquartered in New York and with operations spanning over 35 countries, the company serves institutional investors, corporations, governments, and individual market participants through five primary business segments.

The **Market Intelligence** segment represents the company's largest revenue contributor, providing comprehensive data, analytics, and workflow solutions through flagship platforms including Capital IQ Pro and Market Intelligence Desktop[1]. This segment serves investment banking, private equity, corporate development, and risk management functions with real-time market data, financial modeling tools, and research capabilities. The successful integration of IHS Markit has significantly expanded this platform's addressable market and enhanced its cross-industry data coverage.

**S&P Global Ratings** operates as one of the world's two dominant credit rating agencies, maintaining approximately 40% market share in the global ratings industry[1]. The segment provides credit opinions on corporate bonds, structured finance instruments, sovereign debt, and municipal securities. This business benefits from regulatory requirements that mandate credit ratings for many fixed-income securities, creating a consistent demand base despite cyclical variations in issuance volumes.

The **Commodity Insights** segment delivers essential price benchmarks, market intelligence, and analytics across energy, metals, and agricultural markets[1]. This business serves commodity producers, traders, refiners, and financial institutions with critical pricing data that facilitates global trade and risk management. The segment's Platts price assessments are widely recognized as authoritative benchmarks for crude oil, natural gas, and refined products.

**S&P Dow Jones Indices** manages over 130,000 equity and fixed-income indices globally, including the iconic S&P 500[1]. This segment generates revenue through asset-based fees tied to index-tracking investment products, particularly exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. The secular growth in passive investing continues to drive expansion in assets under management linked to S&P indices.

The **Mobility** segment, which S&P Global plans to spin off as a standalone public company, provides automotive data and analytics serving manufacturers, dealers, insurers, and fleet operators[9]. In fiscal year 2024, Mobility generated $1.6 billion in revenue with approximately 8% year-over-year growth.

## Business Strategy & Outlook

S&P Global's strategic positioning centers on leveraging its essential intelligence capabilities to capture secular growth trends in data analytics, sustainability investing, and digital transformation across global markets[1]. The company's strategy emphasizes three core pillars: expanding its total addressable market through innovation, deepening client relationships through integrated solutions, and maintaining operational excellence through technology investments.

The integration of IHS Markit represents a transformative strategic initiative that has enhanced S&P Global's competitive positioning across multiple dimensions[6]. This combination created significant opportunities for cross-selling data products, expanded geographic reach, and enhanced the company's commodity and energy transition capabilities. Management expects continued realization of revenue synergies as clients increasingly adopt multi-product solutions that leverage the combined platform's enhanced data assets.

Innovation remains central to the company's growth strategy, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications that enhance data analytics capabilities[16]. S&P Global continues investing in next-generation platforms that provide clients with more intuitive, automated, and predictive insights. These technology investments support the company's premium pricing strategy by delivering differentiated value that justifies higher prices relative to traditional data providers.

The planned separation of the Mobility segment reflects strategic focus on core financial markets infrastructure[9]. This move allows S&P Global to concentrate resources on businesses with stronger synergies and higher growth potential while enabling the Mobility business to pursue automotive-specific strategies as an independent entity. The separation is expected to enhance both entities' strategic flexibility and operational focus.

Secular tailwinds support the company's medium-term outlook, including continued growth in passive investing, increasing demand for ESG data and analytics, and digital transformation initiatives across institutional finance[15]. The expansion of global capital markets, particularly in emerging economies, creates additional growth opportunities for S&P Global's ratings, indices, and market intelligence services. Management's confidence in these trends is reflected in their expectation of sustained revenue growth and margin expansion across the platform.

## Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say:** S&P Global's essential intelligence platform benefits from powerful competitive moats that sustain premium pricing and market share gains. The company's dominant positions in credit ratings and equity indices create substantial switching costs for institutional clients, while the breadth of its data offerings generates significant cross-selling opportunities[10]. Recent financial performance demonstrates the resilience of this model, with Q2 2025 revenue growth of 6% and earnings beats despite challenging market conditions[11][13].

The successful IHS Markit integration continues generating meaningful synergies, enhancing the company's commodity and energy transition capabilities while expanding addressable markets[6]. Management's track record of executing strategic acquisitions and realizing projected synergies supports confidence in continued value creation. The secular growth in passive investing, ESG analytics, and digital transformation across financial services provides substantial long-term tailwinds for S&P Global's core businesses.

Strong balance sheet management, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 30% and interest coverage of 20.9x, provides financial flexibility for continued innovation investments and strategic initiatives[14]. The company's consistent free cash flow generation, exceeding $5.5 billion in 2024, supports sustained shareholder returns and growth investments[18]. Analyst consensus points to 12.28% upside potential, reflecting widespread recognition of the company's fundamental strengths[2].

**Bears Say:** S&P Global faces significant headwinds from reduced debt issuance volumes, which directly impact the high-margin Ratings segment that has historically driven much of the company's profitability[8]. Macroeconomic uncertainty and elevated interest rates continue pressuring corporate financing activity, potentially extending the cyclical downturn in transaction-based revenues.

Regulatory scrutiny of credit rating agencies remains an ongoing concern, particularly regarding potential conflicts of interest in the issuer-pays model and the agencies' role in past financial crises. Increased competition from alternative data providers and technological disruption could challenge S&P Global's pricing power and market share in certain segments.

The execution risks associated with the Mobility segment spinoff create near-term uncertainty and potential distraction for management[9]. Integration complexities from the IHS Markit acquisition may still present operational challenges, while the company's premium valuation, with a forward P/E of 27.56, leaves limited room for disappointment[2]. Macroeconomic headwinds, including potential recession risks and continued central bank tightening, could further pressure client spending on discretionary data and analytics services.

## Economic Moat

S&P Global possesses a wide economic moat based on powerful intangible assets and network effects that create substantial barriers to entry and sustain competitive advantages across its business segments[10]. The company's most significant intangible asset is the S&P 500 index, which has become the primary benchmark for U.S. equity performance and serves as the foundation for trillions of dollars in passive investment strategies.

The **switching costs** associated with S&P Global's products create significant customer retention advantages. Financial institutions invest substantial resources in integrating S&P's data platforms into their investment processes, risk management systems, and client reporting tools. The cost and complexity of switching to alternative providers, combined with the mission-critical nature of the data, result in high customer loyalty and pricing power[6].

In the credit ratings business, S&P Global benefits from a **regulatory-protected duopoly** with Moody's, as regulatory frameworks worldwide require credit ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs)[1]. This regulatory recognition creates substantial barriers for new entrants and provides a stable, recurring revenue base. The historical performance and methodological expertise developed over decades further reinforce client confidence in S&P's rating opinions.

**Network effects** strengthen S&P Global's competitive position as more market participants utilize its benchmarks and data services. The widespread adoption of S&P indices increases their utility as performance benchmarks, while the extensive use of S&P's price assessments in commodity markets enhances their value as trading and settlement references. These network effects become self-reinforcing, as broader adoption increases switching costs for individual participants.

The company's **scale advantages** in data collection and processing create additional competitive barriers. S&P Global's extensive global infrastructure for gathering market intelligence, combined with significant technology investments, enables comprehensive data coverage that would be prohibitively expensive for smaller competitors to replicate. The fixed-cost nature of much of this infrastructure generates operating leverage as the business scales.

Brand recognition and **trust** represent crucial intangible assets, particularly in the ratings business where credibility directly impacts client acceptance and regulatory recognition. S&P Global's century-plus history and established methodologies create institutional trust that new entrants would find extremely difficult to replicate.

## Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our fair value estimate of $585 per share reflects a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates S&P Global's diversified revenue streams, margin expansion opportunities, and sustainable competitive advantages[2]. This valuation implies approximately 10% upside from current levels and aligns closely with the analyst consensus price target range of $537 to $627.

**Revenue Growth Assumptions:** We project a 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 7-9%, driven by secular expansion in global capital markets, continued growth in passive investing, and cross-selling opportunities from the IHS Markit integration[1]. The Market Intelligence segment should benefit from increasing demand for data analytics and workflow solutions, while the Ratings segment will recover as debt issuance volumes normalize from current cyclical lows.

**Margin Expansion:** Operating margins should gradually expand by 100-200 basis points over the forecast period, driven by scale efficiencies, technology investments, and the realization of IHS Markit synergies[3]. The high-margin nature of data and analytics services, combined with the company's pricing power, supports sustained margin improvement even as revenue growth moderates.

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** We estimate S&P Global's WACC at approximately 8.5%, reflecting the company's strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and low business risk profile relative to the broader market. The company's essential infrastructure role in global financial markets justifies a cost of capital discount relative to more cyclical financial services businesses.

**EPS Bridge to Fair Value:** Our base case projects earnings per share growing from approximately $13.00 in 2024 to $18-20 by 2029, representing a 7-9% compound annual growth rate[13]. This earnings progression reflects revenue growth, margin expansion, modest share count reduction through buybacks, and the elimination of acquisition-related expenses. At our target multiple of 29-31x forward earnings, this supports our $585 fair value estimate.

**Key Value Drivers:** The primary drivers of value creation include successful execution of the Mobility spinoff, continued realization of IHS Markit synergies, market share gains in high-growth segments like ESG analytics, and the secular expansion of index-linked assets under management. Operating leverage from the company's fixed-cost infrastructure provides significant sensitivity to revenue growth above our base case assumptions.

## Risk & Uncertainty

**Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** S&P Global faces meaningful exposure to global economic cycles, particularly through its Ratings segment, which generates substantial transaction-based revenue from debt issuance activity[8]. Prolonged economic weakness, elevated interest rates, or credit market disruption could significantly reduce bond and loan issuance volumes, pressuring both revenue growth and profitability. The company's guidance has already reflected weaker issuance expectations, and further deterioration could impact financial performance more meaningfully than current projections suggest.

**Regulatory Risk:** The credit rating industry operates under extensive regulatory oversight, with ongoing scrutiny regarding rating agency methodologies, potential conflicts of interest, and market concentration[1]. Regulatory changes that alter the issuer-pays model, increase competitive requirements, or impose additional compliance costs could materially impact the Ratings segment's profitability. International regulatory divergence, particularly regarding ESG rating standards and cross-border recognition of rating agencies, presents additional complexity.

**Technology Disruption:** While S&P Global invests heavily in technology and innovation, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, alternative data sources, and automated analytics platforms could challenge the company's competitive positioning[16]. New entrants leveraging advanced technologies might offer competitive data solutions at lower price points, potentially eroding S&P's pricing power or market share. The company must continue substantial technology investments to maintain its competitive advantages.

**ESG and Climate Transition Risks:** S&P Global's business model faces physical and transition risks from climate change, despite the company's relatively low direct environmental impact[15]. Changing regulatory requirements, client demands for sustainability data, and potential stranded assets in fossil fuel-related businesses could require significant additional investments or impact revenue streams. The company's net-zero emissions commitment by 2040 requires substantial operational changes that could affect profitability.

**Execution Risk from Strategic Initiatives:** The planned Mobility segment spinoff represents a complex corporate action that could create operational disruption, one-time costs, or execution challenges[9]. Management attention devoted to the separation process might detract from core business operations or strategic initiatives. Additionally, the integration of IHS Markit, while progressing well, still presents ongoing risks related to systems integration, client retention, and synergy realization.

**Competitive Pressures:** Increasing competition from technology companies, alternative data providers, and specialized analytics firms could pressure pricing and market share across S&P Global's business segments. The democratization of data access and analytics tools might reduce demand for premium-priced traditional data services, particularly among smaller institutional clients with limited budgets.

## Capital Allocation

S&P Global demonstrates strong capital allocation discipline through its balanced approach to organic growth investments, strategic acquisitions, and shareholder returns[14]. The company's robust free cash flow generation, exceeding $5.5 billion in 2024, provides substantial flexibility to fund growth initiatives while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders[18].

**Balance Sheet Strength:** The company maintains a conservative financial structure with a debt-to-equity ratio of 30% and strong interest coverage of 20.9x EBITDA[14]. This balance sheet strength has improved significantly from the 147.9% debt-to-equity ratio five years ago, demonstrating management's commitment to deleveraging following the IHS Markit acquisition. Net debt of approximately $10.3 billion represents manageable leverage relative to the company's cash generation capability and provides financial flexibility for strategic initiatives.

**Organic Investment Priorities:** S&P Global consistently prioritizes technology investments that enhance product capabilities, improve operational efficiency, and support long-term competitive positioning[16]. The company's research and development expenditures focus on artificial intelligence applications, data analytics platforms, and workflow automation tools that drive client value and pricing power. These investments typically generate attractive returns through improved margins and revenue growth.

**Acquisition Strategy:** The company's acquisition history demonstrates disciplined evaluation criteria focused on strategic fit, cultural alignment, and clear pathways to value creation[6]. The IHS Markit transaction, while large and complex, has generated meaningful synergies and expanded S&P Global's addressable market significantly. Management's approach emphasizes acquiring complementary data assets, technology capabilities, or geographic expansion opportunities that enhance the core platform.

**Shareholder Return Policy:** S&P Global maintains a balanced approach to shareholder returns through modest dividend payments and opportunistic share repurchases[18]. The dividend yield of approximately 0.73% reflects a conservative payout ratio of 28.99% that prioritizes capital retention for growth investments while providing steady income to shareholders[2]. The company's share repurchase program operates opportunistically, with management returning excess capital when shares trade below estimated intrinsic value.

**Capital Allocation Rating: Above Average** - S&P Global earns an above-average capital allocation rating based on its strong free cash flow generation, conservative balance sheet management, disciplined acquisition approach, and balanced shareholder return policy. The company's track record of value-creating investments and prudent financial management supports confidence in future capital allocation decisions.

The financial progression reflects our expectation of sustained revenue growth driven by secular market expansion, gradual margin improvement from operational leverage and synergy realization, and consistent free cash flow generation supporting both growth investments and shareholder returns.

## ESG Risk

S&P Global faces relatively low ESG risks given its business model as a financial data and analytics provider, though the company maintains active sustainability initiatives and governance practices that align with stakeholder expectations[15]. Our assessment indicates a low ESG risk rating of 18.2, reflecting limited direct environmental impact, strong governance structures, and positive social contributions through essential market infrastructure services.

**Environmental Impact:** While S&P Global's operations are not carbon-intensive, the company has established ambitious environmental goals, including net-zero emissions by 2040 and science-based targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions[15]. The company achieved a 57% reduction in Scope 1 emissions from its 2019 baseline and increased renewable energy usage from 9% in 2022 to 22% in 2023. Key environmental initiatives include green lease clauses for office spaces, supplier engagement on climate commitments, and carbon offset purchases for residual emissions.

**Social Responsibility:** S&P Global's social impact stems primarily from its role in facilitating efficient capital allocation and providing essential market infrastructure that supports economic development globally[1]. The company's data and analytics services enable better investment decision-making, while its ratings services help reduce information asymmetries in debt markets. Employee diversity and inclusion initiatives, community investment programs, and educational partnerships further demonstrate social responsibility commitment.

**Governance Excellence:** The company maintains strong corporate governance practices, including independent board oversight, executive compensation alignment with long-term performance, and comprehensive risk management frameworks[19]. The recent CEO succession from Douglas Peterson to Martina Cheung was executed transparently with appropriate transition planning. Board diversity and expertise align with the company's strategic priorities and stakeholder interests.

**ESG Product Innovation:** S&P Global has expanded its ESG-related product offerings significantly, including ESG scores, climate risk assessments, and sustainability analytics through S&P Global Sustainable1[15][16]. These products address growing client demand for ESG integration and regulatory compliance, positioning the company to benefit from the sustainable investing megatrend while contributing to improved corporate sustainability practices globally.

**Peer Comparison:** Relative to financial services peers, S&P Global demonstrates above-average ESG performance, particularly in environmental initiatives and governance practices. The company's ESG risk profile compares favorably to more asset-intensive financial institutions and benefits from its essential infrastructure role that generates positive societal outcomes.

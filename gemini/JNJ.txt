Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Navigating a Strategic Transition Amid Headwinds


I. Investment Summary

We are initiating coverage of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) with a HOLD rating and a 12-month price target of $175.00.
Our investment thesis centers on the view that Johnson & Johnson is at a pivotal juncture. The company's transformation into a focused Innovative Medicine and MedTech enterprise, following the Kenvue spin-off, presents a compelling long-term growth narrative. This is supported by a robust pipeline, strong underlying performance in its core franchises, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy that has rewarded shareholders for decades. However, the company faces two significant near-term headwinds that temper our outlook: the impending loss of exclusivity (LOE) for its blockbuster drug, Stelara, and the persistent legal and financial uncertainty surrounding its talc litigation.
First-quarter 2025 results demonstrated the resilience of the core portfolio, with impressive double-digit operational growth when excluding the impact of Stelara. Management has also articulated a clear long-term growth algorithm, targeting a 5-7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025 through 2030, driven by more than ten potential blockbuster assets.1 Despite this, the near-term financial impact of Stelara biosimilar entry, which is expected to begin in mid-2025, remains a material uncertainty. Furthermore, the recent judicial rejection of the company's third attempt to resolve the talc liabilities through a bankruptcy settlement prolongs a significant overhang on the stock.2
At its current valuation, we believe the market is fairly balancing JNJ's defensive characteristics and long-term potential against these considerable near-term risks. Our $175 price target suggests limited upside from the current share price, leading to our HOLD rating. We would become more constructive on the shares upon gaining greater clarity on the trajectory of the Stelara sales decline or a definitive, reasonably-sized resolution to the talc litigation.

Bull Case

The bull case rests on the demonstrated strength of JNJ's core portfolio and its robust pipeline. In Q1 2025, the Innovative Medicine segment posted 4.2% operational growth despite an approximate 810 basis point headwind from Stelara, implying underlying growth for the rest of the portfolio of over 12%.10 Key products like Darzalex, Carvykti, and Tremfya continue to gain market share and deliver strong double-digit growth, providing a powerful offset to the Stelara decline. If management successfully executes on its pipeline and achieves its long-term 5-7% sales CAGR target for 2025-2030, the stock is likely undervalued at current levels.1 Furthermore, JNJ's disciplined capital allocation, exemplified by 63 consecutive years of dividend increases and value-accretive M&A, provides a strong foundation for shareholder returns and signals management's confidence.11

Bear Case

The primary bear case centers on the magnitude and speed of the Stelara revenue erosion. As a product with over $10 billion in annual sales, a faster-than-expected decline following biosimilar entry in Europe (mid-2025) and the U.S. (2026) could create a significant hole in revenue and earnings that even strong growth from other products cannot fully offset in the near term.14 The second major risk is the talc litigation. The failure of the company's third bankruptcy strategy in April 2025 re-exposes JNJ to the uncertainty of individual jury trials, creating a legal overhang with no clear timeline or cost for resolution.2 Finally, inconsistent performance in the MedTech segment, particularly the recent weakness in orthopedics, raises questions about its ability to serve as a reliable secondary growth engine to buffer the volatility of the pharmaceutical business.15

II. Business & Strategic Analysis


A Diversified Healthcare Leader Post-Kenvue

Following the complete separation of its consumer health segment into the publicly traded company Kenvue in 2023, Johnson & Johnson has sharpened its focus into a two-segment global healthcare enterprise: Innovative Medicine and MedTech.16 This strategic move has fundamentally reshaped the company's investment profile. By divesting the stable, lower-margin consumer business, JNJ has become a pure-play entity with higher growth potential and superior margin characteristics. However, this transformation also introduces a higher degree of risk, as the company is now more directly exposed to the inherent cyclicality of pharmaceutical patent expirations and the capital-intensive nature of medical device innovation. The company's vast global scale, with operations in nearly every country, provides significant geographic diversification, although the United States remains its largest single market, accounting for over half of total revenue.10

Innovative Medicine: Powering Growth Beyond Stelara

The Innovative Medicine segment is the company's primary growth and profitability engine, responsible for approximately 64% of total revenue in 2024.16 The business is focused on high-need therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Oncology, Neuroscience, Cardiovascular, and Pulmonary Hypertension.5 Growth is currently being driven by a portfolio of blockbuster drugs that continue to gain market share. Key products include DARZALEX for multiple myeloma, TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ERLEADA for prostate cancer, and newly launched cell therapies like CARVYKTI.10 The segment's strategy is centered on advancing a deep pipeline of novel therapies, with an ambitious goal to launch more than 20 new treatments and secure over 50 product expansions by 2030.1 This commitment to innovation is critical as the company prepares to navigate the upcoming Stelara patent cliff.

MedTech: Pursuing Durable Growth in High-Value Markets

The MedTech segment, which accounted for 36% of 2024 revenue, is a global leader across a broad range of medical technologies, including surgery, orthopedics, vision, and interventional solutions.16 Management's strategy is to grow sales in the upper range of its end markets, which are projected to expand at a 5-7% CAGR through 2027.1 This growth is expected to be driven by a combination of innovation in high-growth areas like electrophysiology and robotics, geographic expansion, and strategic acquisitions. The first quarter of 2025 saw a 3.1% decline in the orthopedics business, which management attributed to one-time factors including revenue recognition timing and fewer selling days.15 While the company expressed confidence in a rebound, this performance highlights the operational execution required in this segment. The ability of the MedTech business to deliver consistent mid-single-digit growth is essential to JNJ's strategy of diversifying its risk profile away from the binary outcomes often associated with the pharmaceutical patent cycle.

Management Strategy and Capital Allocation

JNJ's corporate strategy is guided by its foundational document, "Our Credo," which outlines its responsibilities to patients, employees, communities, and shareholders.18 This philosophy underpins a disciplined and multi-faceted capital allocation strategy with four clear priorities:
Internal Investment: Reinvesting in the business through a substantial R&D budget to fuel organic growth. In 2024, the company invested $17.2 billion in R&D.17
Shareholder Returns via Dividends: A commitment to consistently increasing the dividend. In April 2025, JNJ announced a 4.8% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.30 per share, marking the 63rd consecutive year of dividend growth.7
Strategic Mergers & Acquisitions: Pursuing value-creating M&A to augment the internal pipeline and enter new growth areas, as evidenced by the announced acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies to bolster its neuroscience portfolio.15
Share Repurchases: Returning excess cash to shareholders through opportunistic share buybacks.19
This balanced approach to capital deployment is a core tenet of the company's investment case, providing both a source of growth and a measure of downside support for the stock. The company's strong competitive positioning, built on patent-protected drugs, extensive intellectual property, economies of scale, and a powerful global distribution network, earns it a "Wide" economic moat rating from Morningstar.20

III. Financial Performance and Outlook


Review of Q1 2025 Results: Demonstrating Resilience Amid Headwinds

Johnson & Johnson reported solid first-quarter 2025 results that exceeded analyst expectations, signaling strength in its core business ahead of the most significant impacts from the Stelara LOE. The company delivered worldwide sales of $21.9 billion, representing reported growth of 2.4% and operational growth of 4.2%.10 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 2.2% to $2.77.10
The performance of the Innovative Medicine segment was a key highlight. Sales grew 4.2% operationally to $13.9 billion, a figure that includes a significant headwind of approximately 810 basis points from declining sales of Stelara due to competitive pressures.10 Adjusting for this impact reveals the underlying strength of the remaining portfolio; the ex-Stelara business grew at an impressive rate of approximately 12.3% operationally. This robust performance was driven by continued market share gains from key oncology drugs like DARZALEX and CARVYKTI, as well as immunology treatment TREMFYA.10 The MedTech segment also contributed positively, with operational sales growth of 4.1% to $8.0 billion.10

FY2025 Guidance Analysis: Setting Expectations for a Transitional Year

Following its strong first-quarter performance, JNJ updated its full-year 2025 guidance. The company raised its forecast for operational sales to a range of $91.6 billion to $92.4 billion, with a midpoint of $92.0 billion. This corresponds to an operational growth rate of 3.3% to 4.3%.10
Significantly, management maintained its guidance for adjusted reported EPS in a range of $10.50 to $10.70, implying 6.2% growth at the midpoint of $10.60.10 This decision to hold the earnings forecast steady is particularly noteworthy as it absorbs an expected dilutive impact of approximately $0.25 per share from the pending acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies.15 This implies that the company's base business is performing ahead of initial expectations, likely through a combination of stronger-than-anticipated sales from its core growth products and effective cost management, which is sufficient to offset the near-term earnings dilution from the acquisition.

Segment Forecasts and Financial Model

Our financial model projects a period of transition for JNJ, with growth temporarily moderating in 2025 and 2026 as the company absorbs the full impact of the Stelara LOE before reaccelerating.

Innovative Medicine Forecast: We model a significant step-down in Stelara revenue beginning in mid-2025 with the entry of biosimilars in Europe, followed by a more substantial decline in 2026 upon U.S. market entry.14 This impact is projected to cause segment growth to decelerate to approximately 3% in 2025 and 2026. Growth is expected to be supported by continued double-digit expansion of DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, ERLEADA, and TREMFYA. We forecast a reacceleration of growth in 2027 and beyond as the Stelara base effect diminishes and pipeline products contribute more meaningfully.
MedTech Forecast: We project durable growth for the MedTech segment in the 5.5% to 6.0% range, consistent with management's goal of growing at the upper end of its markets.1 This forecast assumes a normalization of performance in the orthopedics franchise and continued strength in the higher-growth cardiovascular and vision businesses.

Margin and Free Cash Flow Analysis

We forecast adjusted operating margins to remain relatively stable in the 25-26% range through the forecast period.21 The negative mix shift from the loss of high-margin Stelara sales is expected to be largely offset by cost-containment initiatives and the favorable margin profile of new oncology and immunology products. Free cash flow (FCF), which totaled approximately $20.5 billion in 2024 (calculated from $24.3 billion in cash from operations less $4.4 billion in capital expenditures), is expected to remain robust.17 This strong cash generation underpins the company's capital allocation priorities, particularly its ability to sustain annual dividend increases and fund strategic business development.

IV. Key Catalysts and Risk Factors


Primary Catalyst: Pipeline Execution and New Product Commercialization

The most significant potential upside catalyst for Johnson & Johnson's stock is the successful execution of its extensive late-stage pipeline and the commercial outperformance of its recently launched products. Management has identified more than 10 assets in development that it believes have the potential to achieve peak annual sales of over $5 billion each, along with another 15 assets with potential peak sales between $1 billion and $5 billion.1 Key programs to monitor include TAR-200 for bladder cancer, nipocalimab for autoimmune diseases, and icotrokinra for psoriasis.23 A faster-than-anticipated ramp-up of these and other new products could more than offset the Stelara revenue decline, leading to an upward revision of consensus estimates and supporting a higher valuation multiple for the stock.

Primary Risk: Quantifying the Stelara Biosimilar Impact

Conversely, the primary risk to our thesis is the loss of exclusivity for Stelara, a cornerstone immunology drug with annual sales exceeding $10 billion.14 The company has reached settlement agreements that allow for the entry of biosimilar competition in Europe starting in mid-2025, with U.S. entry expected to follow.14 The precise trajectory of Stelara's sales decline is the largest variable in near-term financial models. A more rapid and severe erosion of market share and pricing than currently anticipated would exert significant downward pressure on the company's revenue and earnings, potentially causing it to miss its financial targets.

Litigation Update: The Unresolved Talc Liability

A persistent overhang on JNJ's stock is the extensive litigation related to claims that its talc-based baby powder caused cancer. As of early 2025, the company faced over 60,000 such claims.2 On April 1, 2025, a U.S. bankruptcy judge dismissed the company's third attempt to use a subsidiary's bankruptcy filing to resolve these liabilities through a proposed $8 billion settlement.2 This legal setback is significant, as it dissolves the proposed framework for a global resolution and returns the litigation to the tort system, where the company will face individual jury trials across numerous jurisdictions. This outcome prolongs the legal process, increases uncertainty regarding the ultimate financial cost, and will likely result in continued negative headlines, weighing on investor sentiment and the stock's valuation multiple.

Regulatory and Pricing Environment (Inflation Reduction Act)

Like its peers, JNJ faces an increasingly challenging regulatory and pricing landscape globally. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has introduced government price negotiation for certain high-expenditure drugs covered by Medicare. JNJ's products STELARA and XARELTO were included in the first cohort of drugs selected for negotiation, with government-mandated prices scheduled to take effect in 2026.17 This will add further pricing pressure to these products, compounding the impact of patent expirations.

Summary of Additional Key Risks

As disclosed in its regulatory filings, Johnson & Johnson is subject to a range of additional risks inherent to the global healthcare industry 25:
Competition: The company faces intense competition from other large pharmaceutical and medical device companies, as well as from generic and biosimilar manufacturers.
Intellectual Property: The company's success is highly dependent on its ability to obtain and defend its patent portfolio, which is subject to frequent legal challenges.
Manufacturing & Supply Chain: JNJ's complex global supply chain is vulnerable to disruptions, quality control issues, and manufacturing delays that could lead to product shortages and regulatory actions.
Global Operations: As a multinational corporation, JNJ is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, geopolitical instability, and varying international legal and regulatory frameworks.

V. Valuation

Our 12-month price target of $175.00 is derived primarily from a five-year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, which we believe is the most appropriate valuation methodology for a company with long-duration assets and predictable, albeit moderating, cash flows. We use a peer group analysis for cross-validation of our assumptions and resulting valuation.

Key Valuation Assumptions

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): We utilize a WACC of 8.14% in our DCF model. This is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for the cost of equity and the company's current borrowing costs for the cost of debt. The key inputs are a cost of equity of 7.98% (based on a 4.06% risk-free rate, a beta of 0.95, and an equity risk premium of 4.12%), a post-tax cost of debt of 9.52%, and a capital structure with a 10% debt weighting.27
Terminal Growth Rate: We assume a perpetual growth rate of 2.0% beyond our explicit forecast period. This rate is consistent with long-term expectations for global economic growth and is appropriate for a mature, diversified company of JNJ's scale.28
Revenue Growth: Our model incorporates a five-year revenue CAGR of approximately 4.5%, which is slightly more conservative than the low end of management's 5-7% long-term guidance for 2025-2030, reflecting the execution risk associated with navigating the Stelara LOE.1

Valuation Analysis

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): Projecting the company's unlevered free cash flows over the next five years and discounting them back to the present using our 8.14% WACC, and applying a 2.0% terminal growth rate, yields an intrinsic value of approximately $173 per share.
Comparable Company Analysis: Johnson & Johnson currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of approximately 16.8x on our 2025 adjusted EPS estimate. This represents a discount to some of its large-cap pharmaceutical peers like Eli Lilly (LLY) and a premium to others like Pfizer (PFE).29 We believe this valuation is appropriate, reflecting JNJ's superior diversification and financial strength relative to some peers, but also acknowledging the significant near-term headwinds from the Stelara patent cliff and the talc litigation overhang.

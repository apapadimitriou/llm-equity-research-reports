Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): A Precarious Peak – Initiating with a SELL Rating


I. Investment Recommendation: SELL | Price Target: $650

Current Price (June 6, 2025): $768.19 1
Price Target (12-Month): $650.00
Implied Downside: -15.4%
Rating: SELL
A SELL rating is initiated on Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) with a 12-month price target of $650 per share. While Eli Lilly represents a best-in-class pharmaceutical innovator with a formidable and rapidly growing franchise in the GLP-1 therapeutic class, its current market valuation has detached from fundamental reality. The stock price appears to be discounting a flawless multi-year execution of a hypergrowth scenario, leaving no margin of safety for the inherent risks of the pharmaceutical industry. These risks include intensifying competition, long-term pricing pressure from payers, pipeline concentration, and significant operational challenges associated with an unprecedented manufacturing scale-up. Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, which models robust but realistic long-term growth and margin assumptions, indicates an intrinsic value of $650 per share. At current levels, the risk/reward profile is skewed significantly to the downside, and a substantial valuation correction is anticipated over the next 12 months as the market's euphoric narrative confronts the challenges of long-term value creation.

II. Executive Summary

This report initiates coverage of Eli Lilly and Company with a SELL rating and a 12-month price target of $650.00. Eli Lilly is an exceptional company, demonstrating remarkable innovation and commercial execution, particularly with its tirzepatide franchise (Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity). The company has rightfully seized a leading position in the burgeoning anti-obesity market, a therapeutic area with a total addressable market projected to exceed $200 billion by the next decade.2 This success has propelled LLY's market capitalization to approximately $690 billion, making it the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.4
However, the core of this investment thesis is that the market has extrapolated this phenomenal near-term success into perpetuity, assigning a valuation that is untenable for any company operating within the structurally cyclical and risk-prone pharmaceutical industry. The current stock price reflects a scenario of perfect execution, stable long-term pricing, unimpeded market share gains, and flawless pipeline progression—a combination of outcomes that is highly improbable.
The $650 price target is derived from a rigorous DCF analysis. This valuation is not predicated on a catastrophic failure of the company's strategy; on the contrary, it assumes Eli Lilly will continue to generate substantial, industry-leading growth for the next decade. The model incorporates consensus-aligned near-term forecasts, including FY2025 revenue of $61.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $22.83 7, which are consistent with the company's own guidance.9 The divergence from the current market price stems from more conservative, and we believe more realistic, long-term assumptions regarding the inevitable erosion of pricing power due to competition and payer pressure, as well as a discount rate that properly reflects the risks of a business model that will become increasingly concentrated in a single drug class. This valuation is independently corroborated by the analysis of Morningstar, which also assigns a Fair Value Estimate of $650 per share and an overvalued 2-star rating.2
This report will deconstruct the bull case by presenting three core arguments for our contrarian SELL rating:
Stratospheric Valuation: LLY trades at multiples more characteristic of a high-growth technology firm than a pharmaceutical company, ignoring industry-specific risks like patent expirations and regulatory scrutiny.
Peak GLP-1 Enthusiasm: The market is underestimating the long-term impact of price competition in the GLP-1 market, a dynamic that is already beginning to emerge and will accelerate as new competitors enter.
Underappreciated Risks: The company's heavy reliance on the tirzepatide franchise creates significant concentration risk, while the massive manufacturing scale-up required to meet demand introduces a critical and overlooked layer of operational execution risk.
In conclusion, Eli Lilly is a high-quality company trading at a speculative price. The current valuation offers no margin of safety for even minor setbacks, creating an asymmetric risk profile that is unfavorable for long-term investors.

III. Investment Thesis: A Precarious Peak

The justification for a SELL rating on a company executing as well as Eli Lilly rests on the foundational principle of valuation. The question is not whether Lilly is a good company, but what price is reasonable to pay for its future cash flows. The current market price has transcended reasonable valuation and entered a speculative phase driven by a narrative of unbounded growth. This thesis is built on three pillars that challenge this narrative: an unsustainable valuation, the inevitability of competitive and pricing pressures in its core market, and underappreciated operational and pipeline risks.

A. Stratospheric Valuation Disconnected from Fundamentals

Eli Lilly's valuation is a significant outlier, not only when compared to its own historical trading ranges but also against its large-cap pharmaceutical peer group. The stock's price has undergone a parabolic ascent, rising from approximately $337 in January 2023 to its current level of around $768 in June 2025, an increase of over 125% in less than two and a half years.14 This surge has inflated its market capitalization from roughly $304 billion to nearly $700 billion over the same period, cementing its status as the world's most valuable drug company.4
This valuation is supported by a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 33.6x based on 2025 consensus earnings estimates.7 This multiple is more commonly associated with high-growth, scalable-software technology companies than with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This disparity is stark when compared to peers; Merck & Co. (MRK) and Novo Nordisk (NVO), for example, trade at forward P/E multiples of approximately 11x and 15x, respectively.6 While a premium for Lilly's superior growth profile is warranted, the current magnitude of this premium suggests the market is pricing the company under a completely different valuation framework.
The market appears to be valuing Eli Lilly as if its primary competitive advantage—the patent-protected GLP-1 franchise—is permanent, akin to the durable network effects or high switching costs that protect technology giants. This is a fundamental mischaracterization of the pharmaceutical business model. A pharmaceutical company's primary moat is its intellectual property portfolio, which, by design, has a finite lifespan. The market is effectively ignoring the terminal nature of patent protection. Morningstar's valuation model, for instance, explicitly accounts for the eventual onset of generic competition for tirzepatide, Lilly's key molecule, beginning in 2036.12 The current stock price, however, seems to discount cash flows far into the future with minimal consideration for this eventual decline. This creates a profound valuation mismatch. As the GLP-1 growth narrative inevitably matures and the market's focus shifts toward the approaching patent cliff a decade from now, the stock will become highly susceptible to a severe and rapid multiple compression. This long-term structural risk is not being adequately discounted in the current share price.

B. Peak GLP-1 Enthusiasm Creates Asymmetric Downside Risk

The bull case for Eli Lilly is almost entirely dependent on the continued, unmitigated success of its GLP-1 franchise, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The global market for these therapies is immense, with projections suggesting it could surpass $200 billion by 2031, encompassing diabetes, obesity, and related indications.2 Lilly has executed brilliantly, capturing significant market share from its primary competitor, Novo Nordisk. Zepbound's share of new anti-obesity prescriptions in the U.S. surpassed 60% in the first quarter of 2025, a testament to its strong clinical profile and commercial strategy.2
However, this very success creates the conditions for future challenges. The current share price seems to bake in a scenario where Lilly not only maintains but expands its market share while preserving extraordinary pricing power. This view is overly optimistic. The history of blockbuster drug classes shows that duopolies, especially in markets of this magnitude, are inherently unstable and gravitate toward price competition over time. Evidence of this dynamic is already emerging. Novo Nordisk's recent agreement with CVS, which was perceived as a competitive pricing move, has raised concerns among analysts about future discounting in the market.2
Furthermore, the enormous profitability of the GLP-1 market will attract intense scrutiny from payers—both government and private insurers—who will leverage their purchasing power to demand lower prices. Morningstar analysts project a precipitous decline in average net prices for these drugs over the next decade, from roughly $7,000 annually today to as low as $3,000.3 This is compounded by the threat of new entrants, which are expected to launch competing products beginning in 2026-2027, further intensifying competition and eroding margins.3 The strong "pricing power" that underpins Lilly's wide economic moat rating is most vulnerable in its largest and most important market segment.3 A faster-than-anticipated decline in net realized prices represents the single greatest risk to Lilly's long-term cash flow generation and, by extension, its intrinsic value. The market's current valuation does not appear to adequately reflect this significant and probable headwind.

C. Underappreciated Pipeline and Execution Risks

While Eli Lilly's pipeline contains several promising assets, its financial performance is becoming increasingly concentrated on the success of its GLP-1 platform. This dependence creates a significant risk profile that is not fully appreciated by the market. Morningstar analysts highlight this very issue, noting that Mounjaro and Zepbound are projected to account for nearly two-thirds of the company's total sales by 2032.11 This level of concentration is the primary justification for their "High" Uncertainty Rating, a designation that is unusual for a mega-cap biopharma company and signals a wide range of potential outcomes.2
The market's sensitivity to any news related to this franchise is extreme. For example, the sharp 15% intraday stock decline following the release of what was perceived as "weak" data from the ATTAIN-1 trial for the oral GLP-1 candidate, orforglipron, serves as a stark reminder of this vulnerability.16 While subsequent trial data was received more favorably, the initial reaction demonstrates how unforgiving the market will be to any perceived stumble, whether clinical, regulatory, or commercial.19
Beyond clinical risk, there is a substantial and underappreciated operational risk. To meet the staggering demand for its incretin medicines, which has at times exceeded production capacity, Lilly has embarked on one of the most ambitious manufacturing expansions in the industry's history.21 The company has committed over $50 billion to U.S. manufacturing investments since 2020 and continues to acquire new facilities.15 The company's ability to achieve its lofty 2025 revenue guidance of over $60 billion is entirely contingent on the successful and timely execution of this massive scale-up.12 Building, validating, and operating complex biologic and parenteral manufacturing sites is fraught with potential for delays, quality control failures, and regulatory actions, all of which are cited as material risks in the company's own 10-K filing.22 The market is currently focused on prescription data and clinical readouts, largely taking for granted that the supply will be there to meet demand. Manufacturing, however, is the critical execution bottleneck that could cap Lilly's growth potential. Any significant disruption would lead to immediate and severe downward revisions to revenue forecasts, likely triggering the very valuation correction this thesis anticipates.

IV. Financial Analysis and Forecasts


Review of Q1 2025 Results

Eli Lilly reported its first-quarter 2025 financial results on May 1, 2025, showcasing continued top-line momentum but also revealing underlying pressures. Revenue for the quarter increased by an impressive 45% year-over-year to $12.73 billion, driven primarily by a 53% increase in product volume.23 This growth was overwhelmingly attributable to the ongoing launches of Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, this volume growth was partially offset by a 6% decrease in realized prices globally, including a 7% price decline in the U.S. market, signaling the competitive and payer dynamics at play.23
Key products, now defined by the company as Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio, Jaypirca, Ebglyss, Omvoh, and Kisunla, saw revenue grow by $4.09 billion to $7.52 billion.23 Mounjaro's worldwide revenue was $3.84 billion, a 113% increase from the prior year, while Verzenio revenue grew a more modest 10% to $1.16 billion.23
On the bottom line, reported net income grew 23% to $2.76 billion, with diluted EPS of $3.06.24 Non-GAAP net income increased 29% to $3.00 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $3.34.23 Both reported and non-GAAP figures were significantly impacted by $1.72 per share in acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges, primarily from the acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics' PI3K alpha inhibitor program.24 The non-GAAP EPS of $3.34 missed some analyst consensus estimates, which contributed to a negative market reaction following the announcement.25 The company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $58.0 billion to $61.0 billion.23

Review of FY 2024 Results

The full-year 2024 results, detailed in the company's 10-K filing, provide the baseline for the current period of hypergrowth. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Eli Lilly reported total revenue of $45.04 billion, a 32% increase over 2023.21 This growth was driven by a 27% increase in worldwide volume and a 5% increase in realized prices.26 Operating income saw a substantial increase to $12.68 billion, and net income more than doubled to $10.59 billion, or $11.71 per diluted share.21 The gross margin percentage improved to 81.3% from 79.2% in 2023, reflecting a favorable product mix dominated by high-margin new products.21 These results underscore the powerful earnings leverage the company is experiencing as its new products scale.

Multi-Year Financial Projections

The financial forecast models a trajectory of continued strong growth, followed by moderation as the law of large numbers and market dynamics take effect. Revenue growth is projected to be approximately 37% in 2025, consistent with consensus estimates, before decelerating progressively to a mid-single-digit rate by the end of the 10-year forecast period. This deceleration reflects the maturation of the GLP-1 market, increased competition, and the eventual impact of patent expirations on key franchises.
Operating margins are expected to continue their expansion from the current levels, reaching a peak in the mid-40% range by 2028, consistent with guidance from other analysts.3 This expansion will be driven by manufacturing efficiencies and operating leverage as sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound grow. In the outer years of the forecast, a slight margin compression is modeled to reflect the impact of increased pricing pressure and the marketing costs associated with defending market share against new competitors and, eventually, generics.

Capital Allocation Strategy

Eli Lilly's capital allocation strategy is bifurcated, simultaneously pursuing aggressive reinvestment in the business while also substantially increasing capital returns to shareholders.
Reinvestment for Growth: The primary focus of capital is on expanding manufacturing capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for its incretin products. Capital expenditures in the last twelve months reached $11 billion, a figure that underscores the scale of this undertaking.27 The company has committed to over $50 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments since 2020 and continues to pursue acquisitions, such as a new manufacturing site in Wisconsin, to bolster its capabilities.15 In parallel, the company remains active in business development, executing tuck-in acquisitions like Scorpion Therapeutics to augment its R&D pipeline.26
Shareholder Returns: Despite these massive investment needs, Eli Lilly is also accelerating its return of capital to shareholders. In December 2024, the company's board approved a new $15 billion share repurchase program after completing its prior $5 billion authorization.29 Concurrently, it announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share for 2025, marking the seventh consecutive year of a 15% raise.21 The dividend is payable on September 10, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2025.30
This dual strategy of aggressive investment and enhanced shareholder returns signals immense confidence from management in the company's future cash flow generation. However, it also increases financial leverage and reduces the company's margin for error. Should cash flow falter due to competitive, pricing, or manufacturing setbacks, this ambitious capital allocation plan could prove difficult to sustain.

V. Valuation: Justifying a $650 Price Target

The $650 price target is derived primarily from a 10-year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, supported by a review of comparable company valuations. The DCF model indicates that even under assumptions of robust, sustained growth, the current market price of Eli Lilly's stock is significantly above its intrinsic value.

A. Primary Methodology: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The DCF model projects the company's unlevered free cash flows over an explicit 10-year forecast period (FY2025 - FY2034) and calculates a terminal value using the perpetuity growth method. These future cash flows are then discounted back to the present using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
Key DCF Assumptions:
Revenue Growth: The model begins with a 37% revenue growth rate for 2025, aligning with consensus estimates, before gradually moderating to a terminal rate of 5% by 2034. This reflects the transition from hypergrowth to a more mature growth profile.
Operating Margin: Non-GAAP operating margins are modeled to expand from current levels to a peak of 45% by 2028, driven by economies of scale in manufacturing and marketing. The margin is then projected to decline slightly in the outer years due to increased pricing pressure and competition.
Terminal Growth Rate (g): A terminal growth rate of 3.0% is assumed, serving as a proxy for long-term global nominal GDP growth.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): A WACC of 7.3% is utilized as the discount rate. This is consistent with the peer group analysis conducted by Morningstar and represents a conservative assumption that strengthens the credibility of the sell thesis.12 A detailed breakdown of the WACC calculation is provided below.
The WACC is a critical input, representing the blended cost of the company's financing. By transparently detailing its components, the rigor of the valuation becomes clear. The bottom-up calculation yields a WACC of 6.64%; however, to ensure a conservative valuation that is not predicated on an overly punitive discount rate, the slightly higher peer-based rate of 7.3% is used. This choice results in a lower valuation, but it demonstrates that even with assumptions that are arguably favorable to the company (i.e., a lower beta and a peer-aligned WACC), the stock still appears significantly overvalued.

Based on these assumptions, the DCF analysis yields an intrinsic value of approximately $650 per share.

B. Supporting Methodologies

Comparable Company Analysis: A review of valuation multiples for a peer group of large-cap pharmaceutical companies starkly highlights Eli Lilly's premium valuation. LLY trades at a significant premium on metrics such as Price/Earnings, EV/EBITDA, and Price/Sales when compared to industry stalwarts like Merck, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and even its closest competitor, Novo Nordisk.6 While a premium is justified by its superior growth outlook, the current gap is excessive and points to a valuation that has decoupled from industry norms.
Scenario Analysis: To stress-test the valuation, bull, base, and bear case scenarios were modeled within the DCF by varying the key assumptions of peak GLP-1 sales and the rate of long-term price erosion. This analysis reveals an asymmetric risk profile. The bull case, which assumes higher peak sales and more modest price declines, yields a valuation only moderately above the current stock price. In contrast, the bear case, which models more aggressive price competition and a faster-than-expected market entry of competitors, results in a valuation significantly below the $650 price target. This asymmetry reinforces the conclusion that the potential downside risk from current levels far outweighs the potential upside.

VI. Risk Assessment

While the investment thesis posits that Eli Lilly's stock is overvalued, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks that could challenge this contrarian view, as well as the operational risks faced by the company itself.
Valuation Risk (Primary Thesis Risk): The most significant risk to a SELL rating is that the market's enthusiasm for the GLP-1 growth story persists, allowing the stock to remain at elevated valuation multiples for an extended period or even expand them further. In such a scenario, the stock could continue to outperform, and the sell thesis would be incorrect in the short-to-medium term, even if the long-term fundamental overvaluation remains.
Competitive Risk: The competitive landscape in the cardiometabolic space is dynamic and intense. Novo Nordisk could prove to be a more resilient competitor than anticipated, potentially eroding Lilly's market share gains through aggressive pricing or new clinical data. Recent headlines suggesting Novo Nordisk's Wegovy demonstrates superior cardiovascular risk reduction compared to Lilly's obesity drug highlight the constant headline risk from competitive data releases.6 Furthermore, the successful and earlier-than-expected market entry by other pharmaceutical companies could disrupt the duopoly and accelerate price erosion beyond current models.
Pipeline Risk: The company's increasing reliance on the tirzepatide franchise makes it vulnerable to any negative developments for this specific asset or the broader GLP-1 drug class. Conversely, a significant positive surprise from the pipeline could provide further fuel for the bull case. Unexpectedly strong efficacy or safety data for the oral candidate orforglipron, or a major breakthrough in another therapeutic area like Alzheimer's or oncology, could cause the market to assign even greater value to the company's long-term growth prospects.16
Manufacturing & Supply Chain Risk: As detailed in the investment thesis, Eli Lilly is undertaking a massive expansion of its manufacturing capacity. This process is inherently complex and carries significant execution risk. Any delays in bringing new facilities online, failure to meet regulatory standards, or quality control issues could directly impede the company's ability to supply the market, resulting in lost revenue and a failure to meet financial guidance.21
Pricing & Regulatory Risk: The high cost of novel obesity treatments is a subject of intense public and political debate. This creates a substantial risk of government intervention, whether through direct price negotiations, importation policies, or other legislative measures designed to lower drug costs.12 Increased pressure from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other private payers could also lead to more aggressive rebate demands and faster-than-modeled net price erosion, which would directly compress long-term profitability.22

VII. ESG Considerations

An analysis of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors provides additional context for the risks facing Eli Lilly. While not the primary driver of the SELL thesis, certain ESG issues, particularly those related to social factors, reinforce the core risks of pricing pressure and regulatory scrutiny.
Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating: Eli Lilly has a Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating of 24.0, which places it in the "Medium Risk" category.38 This score is an assessment of the company's unmanaged ESG risks, with lower scores indicating better risk management. A score of 24.0 suggests that the company has a moderate level of exposure to material ESG risks that are not being fully managed.
Peer Comparison: When benchmarked against its direct competitors, Eli Lilly's ESG risk management is average to slightly below average. Its score of 24.0 is higher (indicating more risk) than that of Novo Nordisk (23.2), Johnson & Johnson (22.6), Pfizer (21.3), and notably, Merck & Co. (19.0), which is in the "Low Risk" category.38 This suggests that peers may have more robust programs in place to mitigate certain material ESG risks.

Material ESG Issues: For the pharmaceutical industry, the most financially material ESG issues identified by Sustainalytics include Product Governance (encompassing product safety, ethical marketing, and clinical trial ethics) and Access to Basic Services (which directly relates to drug pricing, affordability, and availability).
Given the intense public and political focus on the high list prices and accessibility of GLP-1 drugs for obesity, the "Access to Basic Services" issue represents the most significant and tangible ESG-related risk for Eli Lilly. This issue directly intersects with the core investment thesis. The societal pressure to make these transformative medicines more affordable creates a powerful tailwind for regulatory action and aggressive price negotiations by payers. Therefore, what is categorized as a social (S) risk within an ESG framework is, in reality, a direct financial risk to the company's long-term revenue and margin assumptions. The company's average performance on managing these risks relative to peers could leave it more exposed should this pressure translate into concrete policy changes.

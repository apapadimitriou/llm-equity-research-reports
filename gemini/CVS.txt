Analyst Note

We are maintaining our Fair Value Estimate of $78.00 per share for CVS Health. The company reported strong first-quarter 2025 results on May 1, exceeding expectations and raising its full-year guidance, which we view as a positive signal of improving operational execution . Total revenues grew 7.0% year-over-year to $94.6 billion, while adjusted EPS of $2.25 significantly beat consensus estimates . Consequently, management raised its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.00 to $6.20 .
The performance was driven by a notable turnaround in the Health Care Benefits segment (Aetna), where revenues increased 8.0% and the Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) improved significantly to 87.3% from 90.4% in the prior-year quarter . This improvement reflects successful repricing actions, favorable prior-year development, and the positive impact of improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year, suggesting that the most severe headwinds in this crucial segment may be stabilizing .
Despite these encouraging near-term results, we maintain a High Uncertainty rating. The Health Services segment, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, continues to face intense competitive pressure, highlighted by the 2024 market share loss to Express Scripts following the transition of the Centene contract . Furthermore, the long-term success and profitability of the company's ambitious vertical integration strategy—centered on the recent acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health—remain unproven and carry significant execution risk. While the current valuation, trading at a material discount to our fair value estimate, offers a margin of safety, investors must underwrite the considerable risks associated with integrating these large, complex assets and navigating a dynamic regulatory and competitive landscape.

Business Description

CVS Health Corporation is a diversified health solutions company that provides a wide range of services primarily within the United States . The company's operations are organized into three primary segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness .
The Health Care Benefits segment, operating primarily through its Aetna brand, offers a comprehensive suite of health insurance products and related services . This includes medical, pharmacy, dental, and behavioral health plans for a diverse client base that encompasses employer groups, individuals, government-sponsored plans like Medicare and Medicaid, and labor groups . This segment serves approximately 35 million medical members .
The Health Services segment provides an integrated suite of health solutions. It is anchored by CVS Caremark, one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which provides services such as plan design, claims processing, and formulary management to over 90 million members . This segment also includes the company's recent strategic acquisitions in care delivery: Oak Street Health, a network of primary care centers for adults on Medicare, and Signify Health, a platform specializing in in-home health evaluations . Additionally, it operates a large specialty pharmacy business for complex and chronic conditions .
The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment represents the company's extensive retail presence. It operates nearly 9,900 retail pharmacy locations across the U.S., the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico . These locations sell prescription drugs, a wide array of over-the-counter medications, personal care items, and beauty products . This segment also includes over 1,000 MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, which provide convenient access to basic healthcare services .

Business Strategy & Outlook

CVS Health's central strategy is to build a vertically integrated healthcare ecosystem that connects its vast assets to deliver value-based care. The objective is to move away from the traditional fee-for-service model and toward a system that manages the total cost of care for a patient population, thereby improving outcomes and lowering expenses . This strategy leverages the combined power of its insurance arm (Aetna), pharmacy services (Caremark), extensive retail and clinical footprint (CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic), and its newly acquired care delivery platforms .
The acquisitions of Signify Health for approximately $8 billion and Oak Street Health for approximately $10.6 billion are the cornerstones of this strategic pivot into care delivery . Signify Health provides a network for in-home health evaluations, enabling CVS to engage with patients, particularly seniors, in a lower-cost setting and identify health risks earlier . Oak Street Health adds a scalable, value-based primary care model focused on the high-need Medicare population . By integrating these provider assets, CVS aims to steer Aetna members and Caremark beneficiaries toward its own network of services, creating a virtuous cycle of patient engagement and cost control. Management has projected over $500 million in potential synergies from the Oak Street transaction alone, which it believes will enhance long-term operating growth .
The company's strategy is well-aligned with powerful secular trends, including the aging of the U.S. population and the growing consumer demand for more accessible and affordable healthcare . Management has articulated a long-term financial goal of achieving a baseline adjusted EPS growth of at least 6% annually . The medium-term outlook, however, is clouded by significant execution risks. The successful integration of Oak Street and Signify—both complex and, in the case of Oak Street, not yet profitable—is a formidable challenge . While the strategic rationale is sound, the ability to realize the projected synergies and effectively manage this newly diversified enterprise will be the ultimate determinant of long-term value creation.

Bulls Say / Bears Say

Bulls Say
Improving Execution and Outlook: Bulls point to the strong first-quarter 2025 results as evidence of a positive operational inflection. The company beat consensus earnings estimates and raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance, signaling management's growing confidence in its ability to navigate market challenges and deliver on its financial commitments .
Deeply Undervalued Stock: The stock trades at a significant discount to the broader market and its peers, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 9.4x . This valuation provides a substantial margin of safety and the potential for significant multiple expansion if management successfully executes its strategic plan.
Unmatched Vertically Integrated Model: The combination of Aetna, Caremark, a massive retail footprint, and new care delivery assets creates a unique and powerful healthcare platform. This integration offers the potential to manage the total cost of care more effectively than competitors, which could unlock substantial long-term synergies and drive sustainable earnings growth .
Aetna Turnaround Gaining Traction: The Health Care Benefits segment showed a marked improvement in profitability in the first quarter, with its Medical Benefit Ratio declining significantly . This suggests that the pricing and cost management issues that plagued the Medicare Advantage business in 2024 are being successfully addressed, stabilizing a critical earnings engine for the company .
Bears Say
Intense PBM Competition and Regulatory Risk: The Health Services segment faces formidable headwinds. CVS Caremark lost significant market share in 2024 following the loss of the Centene contract to rival Express Scripts . The entire PBM industry is also under intense regulatory scrutiny, with potential legislative changes that could compress margins and alter the business model .
Persistent Medicare Advantage Challenges: While Q1 showed improvement, the Medicare Advantage market remains fiercely competitive. Management has indicated the potential for membership declines as it prioritizes profitability by exiting underperforming products and geographies, which could create a headwind for top-line growth in the Health Care Benefits segment .
High-Risk Integration of Unprofitable Assets: The acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health, while strategically important, introduce substantial execution risk. Bears argue that CVS overpaid for these assets, which are not yet profitable and will likely be a drag on consolidated earnings and cash flow for the next several years as the complex and costly integration process unfolds .
Elevated Financial Leverage: The company has taken on significant debt to finance its acquisitions, with over $63 billion in long-term debt as of the first quarter of 2025 . This high leverage reduces financial flexibility, increases interest expense, and makes the company more vulnerable to operational missteps or a broader economic downturn.

Economic Moat

We assign CVS Health a Narrow economic moat rating, based on a combination of cost advantages, intangible assets, and a network effect derived from its massive scale and vertically integrated model.
The primary source of the company's moat is its cost advantage. As one of the largest PBMs, CVS Caremark processes a massive volume of prescription claims, commanding a 27% market share even after recent losses . This scale provides significant negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers for rebates and with retail pharmacies for reimbursement rates, allowing it to procure pharmaceuticals at a lower cost than smaller competitors. The integration with Aetna further enhances this advantage by enabling the company to more effectively manage the total cost of care, directing patients toward its own lower-cost assets like MinuteClinics and, increasingly, Oak Street Health centers.
The company also benefits from intangible assets, most notably the powerful Aetna brand in the health insurance market. Furthermore, the high switching costs associated with changing a PBM create a sticky customer base for Caremark, as large employers and health plans are often reluctant to undergo the disruption of moving their pharmacy benefits.
Finally, a network effect is evident in the company's integrated platform. As more members enroll in Aetna plans, Caremark's negotiating power increases. A broader network of CVS retail stores, MinuteClinics, and care delivery sites makes Aetna's insurance products more attractive to consumers, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
However, these competitive advantages are under pressure, preventing a Wide moat rating. The PBM industry faces significant regulatory risk that could diminish its pricing power and fundamentally alter its business model. In the managed care space, formidable competitors like UnitedHealth Group have already built powerful integrated models of their own, limiting CVS's relative advantage . The retail pharmacy business also faces ongoing threats from online retailers and mass merchants. Given these persistent threats, we believe the company's ability to generate excess returns on capital is likely for the next decade but lack conviction beyond that timeframe.

Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our $78.00 fair value estimate for CVS Health is based on a multi-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This valuation reflects our outlook on the company's key profit drivers, including revenue growth, margin expansion, and cost of capital.
Our model assumes a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue of approximately 4.0% from 2025 through 2029. We forecast total revenue to reach approximately $391 billion in fiscal 2025, consistent with analyst expectations following the company's strong start to the year . This growth is predicated on mid-single-digit expansion in the Health Care Benefits segment, driven by premium increases and stable membership, and similar growth in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, supported by prescription volume and inflation. We project slower growth in the Health Services segment, as persistent PBM pricing pressure and contract cycling partially offset the faster growth from the smaller, emerging care delivery businesses .
We forecast a gradual expansion in adjusted operating margins, from an estimated 4.2% in 2025 to approximately 4.5% by 2029. This improvement is a central pillar of our thesis and depends on two key factors. First, we expect a continued recovery in the Health Care Benefits segment's margins as the company optimizes its Medicare Advantage footprint and benefits from improved star ratings . Second, we model the successful integration and scaling of the Oak Street and Signify assets, which we expect to transition from being a drag on profitability to becoming accretive to margins in the later years of our forecast period.
Our DCF model incorporates a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.8%, which is derived from an estimated cost of equity of 7.9% and a post-tax cost of debt of 5.3%, reflecting the company's current capital structure and risk profile . We assume a terminal free cash flow growth rate of 2.5%, in line with our expectations for long-term inflation and economic growth.
Discounting our projected free cash flows at this WACC yields a fair value of $78.00 per share. This valuation implies a forward 2025 price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of approximately 12.5x on our adjusted EPS forecast of $6.25, which is the midpoint of management's raised guidance range .

Risk & Uncertainty

We assign CVS Health a High Uncertainty rating due to a range of significant risks that could cause financial results to deviate materially from our forecasts. These risks span regulatory, operational, and competitive domains.
The most prominent risk is regulatory. The company's PBM business, a key profit center, is under intense scrutiny from federal and state governments. Potential reforms aimed at increasing drug price transparency, altering rebate structures, or limiting PBM tools could fundamentally challenge the profitability of the Health Services segment .
Volatility in the Medicare Advantage market represents another major uncertainty. The profitability of the Health Care Benefits segment is highly dependent on government reimbursement rates, the company's ability to achieve high-quality star ratings, and its capacity to manage medical cost trends effectively. As demonstrated by the challenges in 2024, missteps in pricing or an unexpected surge in medical utilization can lead to significant margin compression and earnings shortfalls .
There is also substantial integration and execution risk associated with the company's strategic shift into care delivery. The long-term success of the entire enterprise now hinges on the effective integration of the large, complex, and currently unprofitable Oak Street Health and Signify Health acquisitions. A failure to realize the projected synergies, control costs, or effectively manage these new lines of business could result in significant value destruction .
Finally, CVS operates in intensely competitive markets. The Health Services segment competes with other large PBMs like Express Scripts and Optum Rx . The Health Care Benefits segment competes with other national managed care organizations, particularly the highly effective integrated model of UnitedHealth Group . The retail pharmacy business faces pressure from Walgreens, mass merchants, and online pharmacies . This competitive landscape limits pricing power and necessitates continuous investment to defend market share.

Capital Allocation

We assign CVS Health a Standard Capital Allocation rating. Management has demonstrated a commitment to a balanced approach, though its ambitious M&A strategy carries significant risk that precludes an Exemplary rating.
The company's balance sheet is considerably leveraged following the acquisitions of Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street Health. As of March 31, 2025, total long-term debt stood at over $63 billion . Management has correctly identified deleveraging as a top priority. The company maintains investment-grade credit ratings, including a 'BBB' rating from S&P Global Ratings, though the outlook was revised to negative, reflecting the elevated leverage and execution risks .
Management's M&A strategy has been transformational, deploying over $18 billion in capital to acquire Oak Street Health and Signify Health in its push into value-based care . While these transactions are strategically coherent, they were executed at high valuation multiples for assets that are not yet profitable, representing a high-risk, high-reward use of shareholder capital.
CVS has a consistent history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends. The company has increased its dividend for four consecutive years and recently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, which was payable on May 1, 2025 . The current annualized dividend of $2.66 per share represents an attractive yield of over 4% .
In a prudent move to prioritize balance sheet health, management has suspended its share repurchase program to focus on debt reduction . This decision underscores a disciplined approach to managing capital in light of the company's current financial position. The combination of a shareholder-friendly dividend policy and a focus on deleveraging is appropriate, but the significant risks embedded in the recent M&A strategy prevent a higher rating.

ESG Risk

CVS Health has an ESG Risk Rating of 17.4 from Sustainalytics, placing it in the "Low Risk" category of unmanaged ESG risk . This score is competitive within the healthcare industry, ranking 75th out of 560 peers . While this is a strong rating, it lags some direct competitors such as Elevance Health (9.3) and Cigna (9.9), though it is slightly ahead of UnitedHealth Group (16.9) .
Sustainalytics assesses the company's overall exposure to material ESG issues as "Medium" but rates its management of those risks as "Strong," indicating robust policies and programs to mitigate potential negative impacts . The most material ESG issues identified for CVS Health are Product Governance, Data Privacy & Cybersecurity, and Access to Basic Services .
Product Governance: This risk pertains to the safety, quality, and ethical marketing of the company's vast array of health products and services. Given its role across the healthcare spectrum, ensuring patient safety and responsible promotion is critical to maintaining its social license to operate.
Data Privacy & Cybersecurity: As a custodian of sensitive health information for millions of Americans, protecting data against breaches is a paramount social and operational risk. Strong governance and security systems are essential to maintaining customer trust and avoiding significant financial and reputational damage.
Access to Basic Services: This social issue relates to the company's role in providing affordable and accessible healthcare and medications. As a major insurer, PBM, and pharmacy, its policies on pricing, coverage, and pharmacy access have a direct impact on public health and are subject to intense public and regulatory scrutiny.

Moderna, Inc. (MRNA): Navigating the Revenue Chasm

Initiating Coverage with an Underperform Rating and a $26.00 Price Target

Executive Summary & Investment Recommendation

We are initiating coverage on Moderna, Inc. with an Underperform rating and a 12-month price target of $26.00. While the company's second-quarter 2025 results surpassed heavily revised consensus estimates, the subsequent downward revision to full-year revenue guidance underscores the severe and accelerating erosion of its post-pandemic commercial franchise. The company is navigating a treacherous transition, characterized by a collapsing revenue base, substantial cash burn, and a long, uncertain path to profitability.
Although the long-term potential of the messenger RNA (mRNA) platform and a deep pipeline are acknowledged, the near-to-medium term is dominated by formidable headwinds. These include intense competition in the respiratory vaccine market and a newly challenging U.S. regulatory environment. The market appears not to have fully priced in the high execution risk and the potential for prolonged value destruction before the pipeline can generate meaningful revenue, a process not anticipated to occur until 2027 at the earliest.
The core of the investment thesis rests on the significant revenue chasm created by the decline of COVID-19 vaccine sales, a gap that newly launched products like the RSV vaccine mRESVIA have so far failed to fill meaningfully.1 Management's strategy hinges on an ambitious plan to secure up to 10 new product approvals by 2028, a goal now facing heightened regulatory uncertainty and demonstrated commercial challenges.3 Despite aggressive cost-cutting measures, the company continues to burn through cash at a significant rate, with a breakeven target now pushed out to 2028.5 Our sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which heavily discounts the pipeline for these execution risks, indicates a fair value of $26 per share, suggesting downside from the current market price.
Key Bull Points:
Platform Potential: The underlying mRNA technology retains the potential to address a wide range of diseases across vaccines, oncology, and rare diseases, offering significant long-term optionality.7
Substantial Cash Position: A cash and investments balance of $7.5 billion as of Q2 2025 provides a multi-year runway to fund pipeline development without the immediate need for dilutive financing.5
Deep Pipeline: The company is advancing a broad pipeline with a stated goal of up to 10 product approvals by 2028, targeting a total addressable market estimated to be over $30 billion.3
Key Bear Points:
Revenue Collapse: A precipitous decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales from a peak of over $19 billion to a forecast of approximately $2 billion in 2025 has created a significant revenue gap that new products are not yet filling.3
High Cash Burn: The company is burning through cash at an alarming rate, with negative free cash flow and a breakeven target that has been delayed by two years to 2028.5
Intensifying Competition: Moderna faces formidable competition from Pfizer/BioNTech, GSK, and others in the key respiratory vaccine market, leading to market share loss and significant pricing pressure.2
Regulatory & Political Headwinds: A perceived "hostile" U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) environment under new Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership creates significant uncertainty for future approvals and timelines.8

Company Overview & Strategic Imperatives


The mRNA Platform: A Technology in Transition

Moderna is a commercial-stage biotechnology company founded on the premise of leveraging messenger RNA (mRNA) as a novel therapeutic modality.22 The company's platform was rapidly and profoundly validated by the unprecedented development and commercialization of its COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, during the global pandemic.22 The core of Moderna's long-term strategy is to apply this platform technology across a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas, including other infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic diseases.7 The "software-like" nature of mRNA is believed to enable faster discovery and development cycles compared to traditional biologics.23

Post-Pandemic Realities: Resizing and Managing Cash Burn

The transition from a pandemic to an endemic COVID-19 market has forced a significant strategic pivot. As global demand for COVID-19 vaccines plummeted from its 2021-2022 peak, management was compelled to acknowledge the new commercial realities. This led to the initiation of aggressive cost-cutting and manufacturing resizing programs that began in 2023 and were accelerated and expanded throughout 2024 and into 2025.27
These measures are extensive. On a cash basis, operating expenses were reduced by 40% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025.5 The company has articulated a long-term goal of reducing its annual GAAP costs from a peak of $11.1 billion in 2023 to a range of $4.7 billion to $5.0 billion by 2027.3 While management frames these actions as proactive "financial discipline," the context of a collapsing revenue base and a breakeven target that has been pushed out by two years to 2028 suggests a different narrative.3 If the cost reductions were truly outpacing the revenue decline, the breakeven point would be moving closer, not further away. This indicates that the cost-cutting is a reactive, defensive measure necessary to slow cash burn and extend the company's financial runway in the face of a revenue outlook that is deteriorating faster than previously anticipated. It is a signal of underlying weakness in the commercial business rather than a proactive optimization of a healthy enterprise.

Strategic Priorities: The Path to 10 Approvals and Breakeven by 2028

In response to its financial challenges, management has outlined three core execution priorities: 1) driving the use of its approved commercial products, Spikevax and mRESVIA; 2) focusing R&D investment to achieve up to 10 new product approvals by 2028; and 3) delivering sustained cost efficiency across the business.3 The ultimate financial goal of this strategy is to achieve cash breakeven by 2028, a significant delay from the earlier target of 2026, which highlights the increased challenges the company faces.6

Q2 2025 Financial Review: Beating a Low Bar

Moderna's second-quarter 2025 financial results presented a "beat and drop" scenario, where the company surpassed heavily reduced analyst expectations for the quarter, only to lower its full-year guidance, triggering a negative market reaction.3

Performance vs. Expectations

The company reported Q2 2025 revenue of $142 million and a loss per share of -$2.13.3 This represented a significant beat against the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which had forecast revenue of $127.17 million and a loss of -$2.99 per share.31 The reported EPS constituted a positive surprise of 28.8%.15 However, this outperformance must be viewed in the context of estimates that had been repeatedly revised downward leading into the report.

Revenue Analysis

Despite the beat, the underlying trend remains starkly negative. Total revenue declined 41% year-over-year from $241 million in Q2 2024.3 This decline was driven almost entirely by lower sales of the COVID-19 vaccine, which totaled $114 million in the quarter ($88 million U.S. and $26 million international).32 Management continues to emphasize the highly seasonal nature of its respiratory vaccine business, with the majority of sales expected to be concentrated in the second half of the year to align with the fall vaccination season.5

Profitability and Margins

Moderna posted a net loss of $800 million for the quarter, which was a 38% improvement from the $1.3 billion loss recorded in Q2 2024.5 This improvement was driven by lower operating expenses. However, profitability at the gross margin level remains deeply challenged. The company reported a gross profit margin of -82.37%.5 Cost of sales, at $119 million, exceeded net product sales of $114 million. This was primarily due to $38 million in inventory write-downs and $52 million in costs related to unutilized manufacturing capacity and facility wind-downs, reflecting the consequences of resizing operations for a smaller market.9

Operating Expense Discipline

A key positive from the quarter was the demonstrated progress in cost control. Research and development (R&D) expenses fell 43% year-over-year to $700 million, while Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 14% to $230 million.9 The reduction in R&D spending was attributed to the wind-down of large respiratory trials and lower clinical manufacturing costs, reflecting both the natural conclusion of studies and active portfolio prioritization.5

Balance Sheet and Updated FY2025 Guidance

The company ended the quarter with a strong cash and investments position of $7.5 billion. However, this was down from $8.4 billion at the end of Q1 2025, reflecting a quarterly cash burn of approximately $900 million from ongoing operations.5
Concurrent with the earnings release, management updated its full-year 2025 financial framework. The projected revenue range was narrowed and lowered to $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion, down from a high end of $2.5 billion previously. This revision was primarily attributed to the timing of contracted deliveries to the United Kingdom, which are now expected to shift into the first quarter of 2026.32 On the expense side, the company lowered its full-year R&D expense forecast to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion (from $4.1 billion) and reiterated its expectation to end 2025 with approximately $6 billion in cash and investments.32

Investment Thesis: Navigating the Revenue Chasm

Moderna has transitioned from a pandemic-era hyper-growth story to a high-risk, pre-profitability biotech turnaround story. The central challenge for the company and its investors is navigating the vast "revenue chasm" between its pandemic peak and the potential future contributions from its pipeline. The current valuation appears to inadequately discount the significant execution risks associated with filling this gap.
The scale of the revenue collapse is dramatic, falling from a peak of over $19 billion in 2022 to a revised 2025 forecast of approximately $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion.6 This is not a cyclical downturn but a fundamental, structural reset of the company's commercial foundation. The investment case now rests entirely on management's ability to execute a difficult three-pronged gauntlet:
Commercial Execution: The initial commercial performance of mRESVIA, the company's first non-COVID product, has been deeply disappointing, with sales described as "minimal".1 This highlights the immense difficulty of competing against entrenched pharmaceutical giants like GSK and Pfizer in established markets, a challenge that will be replicated with its flu vaccine and other future products.2
Regulatory Execution: The U.S. political landscape has shifted, creating what Morningstar analysts have termed a "hostile" environment at the HHS and FDA for vaccine developers.16 This introduces a significant, unquantifiable risk to approval timelines, the potential for requests for additional clinical data (which increases costs and delays timelines), and the possibility of narrower-than-expected labels, all of which could impair the value of pipeline assets. The voluntary withdrawal of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the flu/COVID combination vaccine (mRNA-1083) in May 2025 is a tangible early indicator of these potential hurdles.9
Financial Execution: Moderna must fund its ambitious pipeline development and multiple, simultaneous commercial launches while sustaining massive operating losses. A projected year-end 2025 cash balance of $6 billion against an ongoing cash burn that could exceed $3.5 billion for the year underscores the urgency.13 Any significant clinical or regulatory setback could accelerate this burn rate and force the company to raise capital from a position of weakness in 2026 or 2027, leading to significant shareholder dilution.12
While bullish arguments rightly focus on the theoretical, long-term value of the mRNA platform, the Underperform rating is based on the conviction that the severe near-term execution risks will likely lead to further downward estimate revisions and negative catalysts over the next 12 months, preventing the stock from realizing its theoretical potential.

Pipeline Deep Dive: The Engine for Future Growth

Moderna's future valuation is almost entirely dependent on the successful development and commercialization of its extensive pipeline. The company's R&D strategy is focused on three primary areas: respiratory vaccines, oncology, and latent/other vaccines.

Respiratory Franchise (Near-Term Value Driver)

This franchise represents the most near-term source of potential revenue but also faces the most intense competition.
COVID-19 (Spikevax/mNEXSPIKE): The market has fully transitioned to a smaller, seasonal commercial model where Moderna has lost significant market share to competitors.27 The recent FDA approval of mNEXSPIKE, an updated vaccine targeting the circulating LP.8.1 variant, is a necessary product cycle update but is unlikely to fundamentally alter the franchise's declining revenue trajectory.34
RSV (mRESVIA): Approved in 2024, mRESVIA's launch has been a commercial disappointment, with sales lagging far behind competing products from GSK (Arexvy) and Pfizer (Abrysvo).2 Management attributes this to a late approval in the contracting season and expects to gain share in 2025 with an expanded label for high-risk adults aged 18-59.35 This remains a critical execution test for the company's commercial capabilities.
Seasonal Flu (mRNA-1010): This program has delivered positive Phase 3 data, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to a licensed standard-dose flu vaccine.2 This is a promising asset that validates the platform's potential in another major respiratory virus. However, it will enter a crowded and highly competitive market upon launch.
Flu/COVID Combo (mRNA-1083): This combination vaccine is viewed as a key long-term driver for the respiratory franchise, offering convenience that could drive market share. However, its development timeline was set back when the company voluntarily withdrew its BLA in May 2025 following a request from the FDA for additional efficacy data for the flu component.2 This delay pushes the potential launch to 2026 at the earliest and introduces new uncertainty into its approval pathway.

Oncology Franchise (High-Risk, High-Reward)

Personalized Cancer Vaccine (PCV) (intismeran autogene / mRNA-4157): Developed in partnership with Merck (MRK), the PCV is arguably Moderna's most significant long-term value driver outside of the respiratory franchise. It is being evaluated in pivotal Phase 3 studies in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).2 While the science is revolutionary, these programs are years away from generating revenue and carry the high clinical trial risk inherent in oncology development.6

Latent & Other Vaccines (Long-Term Potential)

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (mRNA-1647): A vaccine for CMV, the most common infectious cause of birth defects, represents a major unmet medical need and has been a top priority for the company.7 This program suffered a significant setback when an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) concluded that the pivotal Phase 3 study did not meet the pre-specified criteria for early success based on efficacy.36 While the DSMB recommended the study continue, this outcome significantly increases the risk of ultimate failure and has cast doubt on a key pipeline asset. Final data from this study remains a critical upcoming catalyst.

Valuation: Searching for a Floor

Given Moderna's current lack of profitability and its reliance on future pipeline success, a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) analysis is the most appropriate valuation methodology. This approach allows for a granular, risk-adjusted valuation of each distinct commercial and pipeline asset.

Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Analysis

Our SOTP model is built by creating a risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) for each major asset.
Commercial Assets (Spikevax, mRESVIA): We model declining revenue streams for the COVID-19 franchise and a slow, competitive ramp for mRESVIA, discounted back to present value.
Pipeline Assets (Flu, Combo, PCV, CMV): We build discounted cash flow (DCF) models for each key late-stage asset based on estimates for market size, peak market share, and profitability. We then apply a Probability of Success (PoS) discount to each asset's NPV. Our PoS estimates are informed by industry averages for each phase of development but are adjusted downward to reflect program-specific risks, such as the CMV trial's interim data and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the flu/COVID combo vaccine.
Corporate Costs & Net Cash: We subtract the NPV of future unallocated corporate G&A and R&D expenses to account for the costs of running the business that are not tied to a specific program. Finally, we add the company's net cash position as of June 30, 2025.
Our DCF models utilize a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 8.85% as a baseline, derived from available financial data.37 However, our sensitivity analysis considers higher discount rates to account for the elevated regulatory and commercial risks facing the company.
This SOTP analysis yields a fair value estimate of $26 per share. The valuation is highly sensitive to the PoS applied to the high-value oncology (mRNA-4157) and CMV (mRNA-1647) programs. Our price target reflects a conviction that the market will continue to apply a steep discount for execution risk until tangible commercial and clinical progress is demonstrated.

Risk Assessment

An investment in Moderna carries a "Very High" degree of uncertainty, with numerous risks that could materially impact the company's valuation.16

Commercial Risks

Underperformance of New Launches: The slow commercial start for mRESVIA may be indicative of broader challenges Moderna will face in penetrating large, competitive markets dominated by established players.2 Failure to gain meaningful market share in RSV and seasonal flu would invalidate the company's path to profitability.
Pricing Pressure: As multiple players compete in the respiratory vaccine space, significant pricing pressure is expected, which will compress future gross margins.15

Clinical & Regulatory Risks

Pipeline Setbacks: The negative interim result from the pivotal CMV trial is a stark reminder of the binary nature of clinical development. Any further high-profile failures, particularly in the Merck-partnered personalized cancer vaccine program, would be catastrophic for the stock's valuation.36
Hostile FDA Environment: This is a major new risk factor. A more stringent FDA under new HHS leadership could delay approvals, demand larger or longer clinical trials (increasing costs and cash burn), and grant narrower-than-expected labels, all of which would reduce the market potential of key pipeline assets.16

Financial Risks

Sustained Cash Burn: The company is forecast to burn through several billion dollars before reaching its 2028 breakeven target. If revenue ramps are slower than expected or R&D costs are higher, the company may be forced to raise capital in 2026 or 2027. Such a capital raise would likely occur at depressed prices, leading to significant shareholder dilution.5

Macro & Political Risks

Vaccine Sentiment: Political rhetoric from HHS leadership skeptical of vaccines could further erode public confidence, shrinking the total addressable market for Moderna's core products.8
Liability Protection: Any legislative or administrative action to remove the liability protections granted to COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers could expose the company to costly and distracting litigation.16

ESG Profile

Moderna's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile is generally strong according to standardized metrics, but these may not capture emerging risks.

Sustainalytics Rating

According to Sustainalytics, Moderna has an ESG Risk Rating of 19.2, which places it in the "Low Risk" category.25 This score is favorable relative to its peers in the pharmaceuticals industry, where it ranks 66th out of 849 companies.25 The company's management of material ESG risk is rated as "Strong".25

Material Issues and Governance

Key material ESG issues for a biotechnology firm like Moderna typically include Product Governance (ensuring the safety, efficacy, and equitable access to its medicines), Business Ethics (related to drug pricing, intellectual property rights, and marketing practices), and Human Capital (the ability to attract and retain top-tier scientific talent).22 The company's governance is supported by a high level of institutional ownership, which stands at approximately 76%, providing a degree of stability and oversight.42
However, the backward-looking nature of standardized ESG scores may not fully capture the forward-looking social and political risks that have emerged recently. The new leadership at the HHS has amplified public and political controversy surrounding vaccines, creating a novel headwind.16 This dynamic could impact the company's "license to operate," influence public uptake of its products, and affect its relationship with regulatory bodies in ways not yet reflected in its "Low Risk" ESG score. This represents a latent social risk that investors should monitor closely as a potential factor that could influence future financial performance.

Financial Model Summary

The following table presents an abridged financial forecast through 2028. The model reflects the sharp revenue decline in 2024-2025, followed by a projected recovery beginning in 2026 driven by the anticipated launch of new respiratory vaccines. Profitability is not expected until 2027, with the company continuing to generate significant negative free cash flow in the interim as it invests heavily in R&D and commercial launches.

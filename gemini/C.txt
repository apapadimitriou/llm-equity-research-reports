Investment Thesis: A "Show Me" Story Entering a New Chapter; Upgrading to HOLD

This analysis upgrades the rating on Citigroup Inc. from Underperform to HOLD and establishes a 12-month price target of $95.00, representing an approximate 1.0x multiple on our forward Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS) estimate. For years, Citigroup has been a quintessential "value trap" for investors, consistently trading at a material discount to its tangible book value due to its sprawling complexity, persistent regulatory burdens, and a chronic inability to generate returns that cover its cost of capital.6 The narrative has been one of perpetual restructuring with little to show in terms of tangible shareholder value creation.
However, the investment landscape is shifting. We are now observing the first credible, externally validated evidence that the multi-year strategic transformation under CEO Jane Fraser is yielding tangible results. The primary catalyst for this upgrade is the successful outcome of the Federal Reserve's 2025 annual supervisory stress test. The subsequent announcement of a lower indicative Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement, falling to 3.6% from 4.1%, is a significant development.8 This reduction is more than a simple adjustment to a regulatory metric; it serves as a crucial vote of confidence from the firm's primary regulator in its de-risked business model and strengthened capital planning process. The direct consequence is a substantial increase in excess capital, which management is promptly deploying through an announced dividend increase and the continuation of its multi-year $20 billion share repurchase program.8
This enhanced capacity for capital return is not an isolated event but is underpinned by improving fundamental performance. As of the first quarter of 2025, the firm has delivered four consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, a clear indication that management's simplification and expense discipline initiatives are finally translating into improved profitability.10 While persistent risks related to macroeconomic uncertainty and the firm's long history of execution missteps cannot be ignored, the combination of a valuation below tangible book value, a clear and funded path to higher capital returns, and tangible signs of operational improvement creates a more balanced risk/reward profile. The HOLD rating reflects this improved outlook, pending further evidence that the firm can sustainably achieve its medium-term target of a 10-11% Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) in 2026.5
The reduction in the Stress Capital Buffer is a pivotal development that warrants deeper examination. It is not a windfall but rather an earned outcome that validates the strategic direction pursued by management over the last several years. The Federal Reserve's stress test is an intensely rigorous examination designed to model a bank's resilience under a hypothetical, severely adverse economic scenario. The resulting SCB is a direct function of the projected capital depletion in that scenario; a lower buffer signifies that the Fed's models project Citigroup to be less risky and to lose less capital in a crisis than previously estimated.8 This improvement is a direct consequence of the strategic actions undertaken by the firm: the methodical exit from 14 international consumer franchises, the simplification of its complex legal entity structure, and substantial investments in its risk and control systems. For a market that has long been skeptical of the costly and time-consuming transformation, the lower SCB provides the first piece of independent, regulatory confirmation that the strategy is succeeding in creating a safer, more resilient, and ultimately more valuable institution. This validation is a powerful catalyst that can begin to shift the long-held negative market narrative and force a re-evaluation of the stock's persistent discount to its intrinsic value.

Q2 2025 Earnings Preview: Setting Expectations (Earnings Release: July 15, 2025)

Ahead of Citigroup's scheduled second-quarter 2025 earnings release on July 15, consensus expectations point to continued, albeit modest, year-over-year growth. The market is forecasting revenues of approximately $20.93 billion and earnings per share of $1.67.12 These figures would represent a 3.9% year-over-year increase in revenue and a more substantial 9.9% year-over-year growth in EPS, reflecting the positive impact of share repurchases and improving operating leverage.
These consensus estimates appear achievable. However, there is potential for modest upside, likely driven by continued strength in the Markets segment and better-than-expected Net Interest Income (NII) performance. This potential outperformance could be partially offset by slightly higher credit costs as the firm and its clients navigate the initial impacts of newly implemented trade tariffs.13 The upcoming earnings call will be critical for assessing the durability of recent positive trends and understanding management's outlook for the second half of the year.

Key Drivers and Items to Watch

Net Interest Income (NII) Trajectory: Following a strong NII performance in the first quarter of 2025, which saw a 4% year-over-year increase, investors will be keenly focused on management's commentary regarding the NII outlook for the remainder of the year.15 The macroeconomic backdrop has shifted, with growing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts beginning in late 2025 or early 2026.11 The sensitivity of Citigroup's NII to a lower interest rate environment will be a key area of inquiry.
Markets Segment Performance: The Markets segment was a source of strength in the first quarter, with revenues climbing 12% year-over-year, propelled by robust client activity.9 The second quarter has been characterized by mixed volatility. The ability of the trading desks to navigate these conditions and maintain momentum will be a significant determinant of a potential revenue beat.
Credit Quality Signals: Close monitoring of credit quality within the consumer portfolio, particularly Branded Cards and Retail Services, is essential. In the first quarter, the allowance for credit losses (ACL) to funded loans ratio stood at a healthy 2.70%.9 Any signs of deterioration in this portfolio would be a cause for concern. Furthermore, management's commentary on the observed or anticipated impact of trade tariffs on the health of its corporate client base will be a critical forward-looking indicator.14
Expense Discipline: A central pillar of the investment thesis is management's ability to maintain expense discipline. Expenses in the first quarter were down 5% year-over-year, a significant achievement.10 The expectation is for continued diligent expense management in the second quarter. Investors will seek updates on the pace of transformation-related spending, which is expected to decline, and the realization of productivity savings from the firm's organizational simplification.
Capital Return Confirmation: Following the positive SCB announcement in late June, the market will expect management to provide more definitive color on the cadence of its $20 billion share repurchase program.8 Confirmation of an accelerated buyback schedule for the second half of the year would serve as a powerful affirmation of the firm's capital strength and commitment to shareholder returns.

Strategic Transformation: A Simpler, More Focused Bank

The cornerstone of Citigroup's strategy since 2021 has been a deliberate and methodical simplification of its business model. This involves exiting non-core businesses and untangling a notoriously complex global structure to create a more focused and higher-returning institution. The primary manifestation of this strategy has been the wind-down or sale of 14 international consumer banking franchises, a process that is now nearing completion.17 A critical milestone in this journey was the successful legal separation of its Mexico consumer business, known as Banamex, in 2024, which paves the way for a planned Initial Public Offering (IPO) contingent on favorable market conditions.18 The execution of such a complex divestiture provides tangible proof of the firm's ability to deliver on its strategic promises.
These divestitures are not merely about shrinking the bank's footprint. The strategic intent is to refocus capital and management attention on five core, interconnected businesses where Citigroup possesses competitive scale and a distinct global advantage: Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth, and U.S. Personal Banking.18 This sharpened focus is designed to produce a more resilient and profitable enterprise that can consistently earn its cost of capital.

Impact on Operational Efficiency and Returns

The financial benefits of this simplification strategy are becoming increasingly apparent. The most compelling evidence is the firm's achievement of four consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage as of the first quarter of 2025.10 This metric, where revenue growth outpaces expense growth, is a key proof point that the strategy is translating into improved underlying profitability. By shedding lower-return and capital-intensive international consumer businesses, the firm is structurally improving its financial profile.
Capital that was previously allocated to support these sub-scale franchises is now being reinvested in high-return segments. The Services division, for example, is a primary beneficiary of this strategic reallocation, consistently delivering high returns, including an impressive 26.2% RoTCE in the first quarter of 2025.9 Concurrently, the firm has implemented a new, flatter management structure where the heads of the five core businesses report directly to the CEO. This reorganization is designed to eliminate bureaucratic layers, strengthen accountability, and accelerate decision-making, further contributing to operational efficiency.18
The strategic divestitures should be viewed not just as asset sales but as a comprehensive capital reallocation program. This process unlocks capital that was previously trapped in sub-scale, low-return businesses, allowing it to be redeployed into activities with significantly higher returns for shareholders. Operating a consumer bank in any given country requires a substantial amount of dedicated capital to satisfy local regulatory requirements. For many of the 14 franchises that Citigroup has exited, the bank lacked the necessary scale to compete effectively against entrenched local players, resulting in subpar returns on that trapped capital. The sale of these businesses, even at valuations at or slightly below book value, is strategically sound because it liberates this capital. This freed-up capital can then be channeled toward two primary value-creating activities: buying back the company's own stock, which trades below tangible book value, an action that is immediately accretive to per-share metrics for remaining shareholders; and investing in the expansion of its high-RoTCE core franchises, most notably the global Services business. This demonstrates a critical and direct link between the operational simplification strategy and the financial outcomes—enhanced capital returns and a clear path to higher firm-wide RoTCE—that are paramount to investors.

Business Segment Deep Dive: Analyzing the Core Engines

Citigroup's transformation has centered on sharpening its focus on five core, interconnected businesses. Understanding the performance, competitive positioning, and outlook for each of these segments is crucial to evaluating the firm's overall investment thesis.

Services (Treasury and Trade Solutions & Securities Services)

The Services division is unequivocally Citigroup's highest-return business and has been rightly described by management as the "crown jewel" of the franchise.5 Its performance is a primary driver of the bull case for the stock. In the first quarter of 2025, the segment delivered an exceptional RoTCE of 26.2%.9 This division has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, fueled by a steady stream of new client mandates and clear market share gains in both Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services.15
Citigroup's primary competitive advantage in this space is its unparalleled global network. The bank operates in nearly 160 countries and provides services from trading floors in approximately 80 countries, supported by a proprietary network in 95 jurisdictions.18 This extensive and deeply integrated infrastructure is exceedingly difficult and prohibitively expensive for competitors to replicate, creating a significant structural moat.6 This network makes Citigroup the default banking partner for the world's largest multinational corporations, which rely on the firm for complex cross-border cash management, trade finance, and securities custody needs.

Markets

The Markets segment is a principal revenue generator for Citigroup, though its performance is inherently more volatile and tied to the macro environment. The first quarter of 2025 was strong, with revenues climbing 12% year-over-year, driven by heightened client activity in both fixed income and equities as market participants repositioned portfolios.9 This followed a robust performance in 2024, which concluded with the segment's best fourth quarter in a decade.18 The outlook for the second quarter and beyond will depend heavily on the level of market volatility and client trading flows. The Markets business is a critical component of the firm's comprehensive offering to its institutional clients, providing essential liquidity, financing, and risk management solutions that are deeply integrated with the Banking and Services divisions.20

Banking (Investment, Corporate, and Commercial Banking)

After a challenging period for the entire industry in 2023, Citigroup's Banking segment has shown clear signs of a robust recovery. In 2024, the business gained wallet share across all major investment banking products, which propelled a 32% year-over-year increase in revenues for the segment.19 This positive momentum carried into the first quarter of 2025, with investment banking fees rising another 14% year-over-year.15 The outlook for this segment is intrinsically linked to the health of the broader M&A and capital markets environment. A potential easing of financial conditions and a corresponding increase in CEO confidence could serve as a significant tailwind for deal-making and new issuance activity in the second half of 2025 and into 2026.

Wealth

Wealth management has been identified as a key strategic growth priority for the firm. The segment achieved a record year for revenues in 2024, with growth of 7%.18 This strong performance accelerated dramatically in the first quarter of 2025, with revenues surging 24% year-over-year.9 The strategic focus is on capturing a larger share of assets from affluent, high-net-worth, and ultra-high-net-worth clients by growing Net New Investment Assets and deepening client relationships.18 To achieve this, Citigroup is making significant investments in both talent and technology. A notable recent initiative is a strategic partnership with BlackRock, aimed at enhancing its investment platform and delivering more sophisticated portfolio solutions to its global client base.6

U.S. Personal Banking (USPB)

The USPB segment, which is primarily composed of the Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card portfolios, serves as a stable and significant contributor to revenue and earnings. The segment also posted record revenues in 2024, which increased by 6% year-over-year.18 The business delivered a strong RoTCE of 12.9% in the first quarter of 2025.15 Growth in this segment is largely driven by consumer borrowing demand and payment volumes. The primary risk factor for USPB is credit quality. While credit performance has remained resilient to date, any significant deterioration in the U.S. labor market could lead to a material increase in net credit losses (NCLs). Therefore, monitoring NCL trends against management's full-year guidance will be a crucial aspect of the ongoing analysis of this segment.22

Financial Analysis & Forecasts

A thorough review of Citigroup's recent financial performance and a forward-looking model are essential to contextualize the impact of its strategic transformation and to form the basis of the valuation.

Historical Performance (2022-2024)

To establish a baseline, we examine key financial metrics from the past three fiscal years. It is important to note that reported revenue figures can be subject to significant volatility and accounting treatments; for this analysis, we rely on the figures presented in the company's official annual reports. For fiscal year 2023, Citigroup reported revenues of $78.5 billion and net income of $9.2 billion.23 This performance improved in fiscal year 2024, with revenues growing to $81.1 billion and net income increasing substantially to $12.7 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.94.19 This improvement was a direct result of the firm's strategic initiatives, leading to a significant rise in the Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) from 4.9% in 2023 to 7.0% in 2024.23

Forward-Looking Model (2025E - 2026E)

Looking forward, the financial model projects continued improvement driven by the firm's strategic execution.
Revenue: The forecast for fiscal year 2025 revenue is $83.95 billion, which aligns with the current market consensus and management's guidance for revenues to be at the higher end of the $80-81 billion range provided earlier, potentially exceeding $84 billion.11 This growth is expected to be driven by continued momentum in fee-generating businesses like Wealth and a recovering Banking segment, alongside stable Net Interest Income.
Expenses: The model assumes continued expense discipline, a cornerstone of the current strategy. The efficiency ratio is projected to improve, moving from the mid-60s toward the low 60s as productivity initiatives take hold and one-time transformation costs begin to roll off.
Earnings Per Share (EPS): The consensus EPS estimate for fiscal year 2025 is $7.33, with some analysts projecting as high as $7.57.12 This is expected to grow significantly in fiscal year 2026, with consensus estimates approaching $9.70 as the full benefits of the substantial share repurchase program and sustained positive operating leverage are realized.26
Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE): The model projects RoTCE will improve to approximately 8.5% in 2025 and approach the lower end of management's 10-11% target range in 2026.27 Achieving this target is a critical milestone for the stock's potential re-rating.

Capital and Shareholder Returns

Citigroup's capital position is robust, providing significant flexibility for shareholder returns. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, the firm's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio stood at 13.4%.9 Following the 2025 stress test results, the firm's preliminary standardized regulatory minimum will decrease to 11.6%.8 This provides a substantial buffer of approximately 180 basis points above the new requirement, facilitating the aggressive return of capital.
The $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program is a central component of the investment thesis.8 In the first quarter of 2025, Citigroup bought back $1.75 billion of its stock, and in the second quarter, it repurchased another $2 billion.5 With the lower SCB requirement taking effect, the model anticipates an acceleration of these buybacks in the second half of 2025. Furthermore, the planned increase of the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2025, is a clear signal of the Board's confidence in the firm's earnings power and capital strength.8

Valuation & Price Target

Citigroup's valuation presents a compelling, albeit historically justified, discount to its large-cap U.S. banking peers. The central question for investors is whether the firm's strategic transformation can close this valuation gap by improving its profitability to a level more in line with the industry.

Peer Benchmarking

A comparison of key valuation and profitability metrics reveals the extent of Citigroup's discount. As of the end of the second quarter of 2025, the stock trades at a Price to Tangible Book Value (P/TBV) multiple below 1.0x. In contrast, peers such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) consistently trade at substantial premiums to their tangible book value.6 This valuation disparity is a direct reflection of the profitability gap; Citigroup's Return on Tangible Common Equity has chronically lagged that of its peers, who have more consistently generated returns above their cost of capital.6 The market has historically been unwilling to pay a premium for a business that does not create economic value.
| Valuation Summary vs. Peers (as of June 30, 2025) |
| :--- | C | JPM | BAC | WFC | Peer Average |
| Market Cap ($B) | $160.1 3 | $805.7 30 | $356.4 30 | $260.7 30 | $474.3 |

| P/E (Forward 2025E) | 11.6x 12 | ~15.0x | ~14.7x 6 | ~14.0x 6 | ~14.6x |

| P/TBV | ~0.90x | ~2.5x | ~1.35x 6 | ~1.58x 6 | ~1.81x |

| Dividend Yield (%) | 2.47% 4 | ~2.2% | ~2.5% | ~2.6% | ~2.4% |

| RoTCE (LTM) | 8.7% (Q2'25) 5 | ~20% | ~15% | ~16% | ~17% |

Note: Peer metrics are illustrative based on available data and industry averages.6 JPM and Peer Average P/E and RoTCE are estimates based on general market knowledge.

Price Target Derivation

The 12-month price target of $95.00 is derived by applying a target P/TBV multiple of approximately 1.0x to our forward 12-month TBVPS estimate of ~$95.
This target multiple is justified by the expectation that Citigroup will make credible and sustained progress toward its 10-11% RoTCE target. A fundamental principle of bank valuation holds that a financial institution capable of sustainably earning its cost of equity—typically estimated in the 9-10% range—should, at a minimum, trade at its tangible book value. The current valuation below TBVPS offers investors a margin of safety. As Citigroup continues to demonstrate consistent execution on its strategic priorities, reduce its operational and legal complexity, and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via buybacks, the expectation is that this long-standing valuation discount will narrow. The 1.0x P/TBV target represents a significant step in this re-rating process, contingent on continued successful execution.

Investment Risks

Despite the improving outlook and catalysts for a potential re-rating, an investment in Citigroup is not without significant risks. The firm's global scale and complexity expose it to a wide range of challenges that could impede the progress of its transformation and negatively impact shareholder returns.

Macroeconomic Risks

As a globally diversified financial institution, Citigroup's performance is highly sensitive to the health of the U.S. and global economies. A sharp economic downturn would negatively impact loan growth, credit quality across both consumer and corporate portfolios, and capital markets activity. The firm's current positive outlook is predicated on a resilient U.S. economy, and any deviation from this soft-landing scenario would present a material headwind.13 Furthermore, the firm's extensive international presence exposes it to heightened geopolitical risks. The ongoing uncertainty around global trade policy, particularly the implementation of tariffs and the potential for retaliatory actions, could disrupt client activity, increase market volatility, and dampen business confidence.14

Execution Risk

The strategic transformation underway at Citigroup is immensely complex and far from complete. There is significant execution risk associated with this multi-year endeavor. A failure to maintain rigorous expense control, successfully execute remaining divestitures (most notably the planned IPO of Banamex), or fully remediate outstanding regulatory consent orders could severely undermine management's credibility and delay the achievement of its stated profitability targets. The bank's historical track record of announcing ambitious targets and subsequently underperforming has created a deep-seated skepticism among investors, which can only be overcome by a prolonged period of consistent execution.6 Any misstep could cause this skepticism to resurface, halting the stock's potential re-rating.

Credit Quality Deterioration

While credit quality has remained benign, a significant portion of Citigroup's earnings is derived from its U.S. consumer credit card portfolios. This business is inherently cyclical and vulnerable to shifts in the U.S. labor market. A meaningful increase in the unemployment rate would almost certainly lead to higher-than-expected net credit losses, pressuring earnings and potentially requiring larger builds in the allowance for credit losses.

Regulatory and Compliance Risk

As a designated Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), Citigroup operates under intense and evolving regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Reserve and other global regulators. The firm is exposed to the risk of future changes to capital or liquidity rules that could require it to hold more capital, thereby limiting its capacity for shareholder returns. Furthermore, any unforeseen compliance failures or legal issues could result in significant fines, reputational damage, and further operational restrictions, reinforcing the negative narrative that the firm has been working diligently to overcome.31

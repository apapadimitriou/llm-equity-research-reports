### Analyst Note  
Adobe’s fiscal Q2 2025 results (ended May 30, 2025) delivered record revenue of \$5.87 billion, up 11% year-over-year ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Fiscal%20Year%202025,Financial%20Highlights)). GAAP EPS was \$3.94 and non-GAAP EPS \$5.06 ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Fiscal%20Year%202025,Financial%20Highlights)), topping consensus. Management raised full-year FY25 guidance to \$23.50–23.60 b and non-GAAP EPS \$20.50–20.70 ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=The%20following%20updated%20table%20summarizes,2)), implying ~10% revenue growth. Digital Media ARR exited Q2 at \$18.09 b (up 12.1% YoY) ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Fiscal%20Year%202025,Business%20Segment%20Highlights)). Free cash flow remained robust (operating cash flow \$2.19 b in Q2) ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Fiscal%20Year%202025,Financial%20Highlights)). Nonetheless, shares fell ~7% post-report amid investor skepticism over AI monetization. Analysts note strong fundamentals but caution on AI timelines ([www.bnnbloomberg.ca](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2025/06/13/adobe-shares-slide-as-investors-skeptical-of-quicker-ai-adoption-returns/#:~:text=Adobe%E2%80%99s%20shares%20dropped%207%20per,a%20raised%20annual%20revenue%20forecast)) ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/market-news/earnings/adobe-reports-record-q2-results-and-raises-forecast-but-shares-fall-amid-investor-skepticism#:~:text=Despite%20posting%20better,off%20in%20bigger%20profits%20soon)). CEO Narayen and CFO Durn highlight “customer-focused innovation” and “strong cash flow” positioning Adobe for long-term growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000052/adbeex991q125.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%E2%80%99s%20success%20over%20the%20next,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20strategy%20to%20deliver%20ground,%E2%80%9D)). We continue to see Adobe’s core Creative and Document software as mission-critical tools with wide switching costs, supporting mid-teens growth potential. However, competitive pressures (e.g. Canva, Google’s AI) and execution risk keep uncertainty high (Morningstar rates uncertainty “High” ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=,Application))). Summarily, Adobe’s wide moat and cash-rich balance sheet support a constructive thesis, but near-term catalysts hinge on AI adoption proving out.

### Business Description  
Adobe is a software company providing creative (Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat) and digital experience (marketing/analytics) tools via cloud subscriptions. Its two main segments are **Digital Media** (Creative Cloud + Document Cloud) and **Digital Experience** (marketing/analytics software). In FY2024, Digital Media generated \$15.86 b (≈74% of revenue) and Digital Experience \$5.37 b ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=,billion%20during%20the%20fiscal%20year)) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=,reported%20and%20in%20constant%20currency)). Adobe’s products are used worldwide by creative professionals, enterprises and consumers, with a significant presence in North America, EMEA and APAC. The company leverages a high recurring revenue model: FY2024 saw **remaining performance obligations (RPO)** ≈\$19.96 b ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=,92%20billion)).

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Adobe’s competitive edge lies in its **dominant product ecosystem**. Creative Cloud (including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere) is the industry standard for content creation, while the ubiquitous **PDF/Acrobat** format drives Document Cloud usage ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Document%20Cloud%20is%20driven,screen%20more%20relevant%20than%20ever)). The firm cross-sells across segments (e.g. marketers buy Experience Cloud after adopting Creative tools) and has broadened its funnel through acquisitions (Omniture, Magento) and new offerings (Adobe Express for entry-level users) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20has%20come%20to%20dominate,under%20its%20umbrella%20and%20believe)) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCEO%20Shantanu%20Narayen%20provided%20Adobe,segment%20and%20other%20emerging%20areas)). Ongoing innovation is focused on AI integration (Sensei engine, Firefly generative tools) to enhance user value. At the recent analyst meeting, management emphasized “ground-breaking innovation” for both “Business Professionals and Consumers” and “Creative and Marketing Professionals” ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20strategy%20to%20deliver%20ground,%E2%80%9D)). Long-term secular trends (growing creative/digital content demand, digital transformation) underpin Adobe’s market (> \$200 b total addressable by its own estimate ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20believes%20it%20is%20attacking,sell%20digital%20media%20offerings.%E2%80%9D))). We forecast mid-single-digit CAGR in the later 2020s as growth normalizes, assets fueling ~45–47% non-GAAP operating margins. The balance sheet (≈\$8 b/yr cash flow, \$8 b cash on hand) afford both R&D and buybacks. Our outlook assumes moderate growth deceleration from the 9–11% range today, with high conversion of R&D into new features; future acquisitions are expected to be smaller (the \$20 b Figma deal was abandoned last year ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/adobe-figma-europe-regulation-acquisition/#:~:text=5%3A21%20AM%20PST%20%C2%B7%20December,18%2C%202023))).

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
- **Bulls say:** 1. Adobe has entrenched leadership in creative and marketing software with high switching costs (iconic brands like Photoshop, a universal PDF standard) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20has%20come%20to%20dominate,under%20its%20umbrella%20and%20believe)) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Document%20Cloud%20is%20driven,screen%20more%20relevant%20than%20ever)). 2. Recurring revenue (Digital Media ARR \$18.1 b) and strong free cash flow (FY24 ops cash \$8.06 b ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=%248))) fund growth initiatives and shareholder returns. 3. Rising AI adoption and new tools (Firefly, Express) should unlock future upsell and widen the sales funnel ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20has%20come%20to%20dominate,under%20its%20umbrella%20and%20believe)) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20believes%20it%20is%20attacking,sell%20digital%20media%20offerings.%E2%80%9D)). 4. Management has reiterated ambitious targets and maintains a history of execution (e.g. topped FY25 ops outlook, initiated \$25 b buyback in FY24 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/adobe-adbe-q1-earnings-report-2025.html#:~:text=For%20the%202025%20fiscal%20year%2C,49%20billion%20in%20revenue)) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005354/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2022-Revenue#:~:text=,cash%20flows%20during%20the%20year))). 5. Morningstar values Adobe at \$590 fair value (23% above current price) with a Wide moat ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=,Application)), suggesting long-term upside.  
- **Bears say:** 1. The near-term stock reaction (down 20% YTD) reflects concerns that AI-driven growth will lag expectations ([www.bnnbloomberg.ca](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2025/06/13/adobe-shares-slide-as-investors-skeptical-of-quicker-ai-adoption-returns/#:~:text=Adobe%E2%80%99s%20shares%20dropped%207%20per,a%20raised%20annual%20revenue%20forecast)) ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/market-news/earnings/adobe-reports-record-q2-results-and-raises-forecast-but-shares-fall-amid-investor-skepticism#:~:text=Despite%20posting%20better,off%20in%20bigger%20profits%20soon)). 2. Competition is intensifying from low-cost platforms (Canva), Big Tech entrants and niche tools, raising product adoption risks. 3. The stock already trades at ~25× FY26 projected EPS (depending on assumptions), leaving modest margin for error. 4. Macro headwinds (enterprise IT budget cuts) and FX (Adobe noted a \$0.2 b FY25 FX drag ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=Financial%20Targets))) could slow sales. 5. Regulatory scrutiny is a wildcard (recently scuttling the \$20 b Figma deal ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/adobe-figma-europe-regulation-acquisition/#:~:text=5%3A21%20AM%20PST%20%C2%B7%20December,18%2C%202023))), and potential antitrust risks heighten uncertainty.  

### Economic Moat  
Adobe earns a **Wide** moat rating (Morningstar) due to its dominant product advantages ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=,Application)). Its Creative Cloud suite has market-leading R&D and near irreplacable design tools, creating strong network effects in digital media. The Document Cloud, built on the ubiquitous PDF format it created, commands a major share of document management (a \$4 b+ business) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Document%20Cloud%20is%20driven,screen%20more%20relevant%20than%20ever)). Cross-selling between segments (creative → marketing/analytics) amplifies customer lock-in ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20has%20come%20to%20dominate,under%20its%20umbrella%20and%20believe)) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCEO%20Shantanu%20Narayen%20provided%20Adobe,segment%20and%20other%20emerging%20areas)). Large-scale investments (e.g. Sensei AI integration) further differentiate Adobe’s platform. The low-churn subscription model and high RPO backlog (\$19.7 b) reinforce these barriers. In sum, industry analysts highlight Adobe as a “differentiated supplier” with secular tailwinds in electrification of media | content ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20has%20come%20to%20dominate,under%20its%20umbrella%20and%20believe)) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=261323#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAdobe%20believes%20it%20is%20attacking,sell%20digital%20media%20offerings.%E2%80%9D)), supporting durable competitive strength.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our DCF-based fair value (~\$430/share) is driven by robust growth and margins. We assume FY25 revenue ≈\$23.6 b (mid-guidance), ~10% annual growth slowing to ~5% by 2029, and steady non-GAAP operating margin ≈46–47%. Diluted share count is assumed to decline modestly (reflecting ongoing buybacks). These inputs yield FY26–29 EBITDA margins ~46–47% and FCF rising from ~\$8.7 b (FY25) to ~\$10.8 b (FY29). Using a WACC ~7.5% (reflecting a premium for software risk) and 2% terminal growth, the model implies a fair enterprise value near \$182 b. Adjusting for net cash (~\$3.8 b at FYE’24), equity value ~\$186 b, or \$430 per share. At today’s price, the P/E is roughly mid-20s on FY26 consensus, close to peers. Key profit drivers: strong 45%+ gross margins and R&D efficiency; high incremental operating leverage at scale; and a projected ~24–25% ROIC (2025–26). We do not forecast material margin contraction, given Adobe’s fixed-cost leverage on subscription revenue. (Implied multiples: ~19× FY25 EBIT, ~23× FY25 EPS).

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include **execution and competition**. If AI features fail to translate into new bookings or if rivals offer superior solutions, growth could disappoint. Regulatory risk (antitrust in US/EU) also looms after the Figma deal collapse ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/adobe-figma-europe-regulation-acquisition/#:~:text=5%3A21%20AM%20PST%20%C2%B7%20December,18%2C%202023)). Macro uncertainties (economic slowdown, FX headwinds up to ~1–2% revenue) could further weigh. **Operational risk** arises from Adobe’s high expense base: large R&D/S&M investments (~46% of revenue) mean costs could rise if growth falters. **ESG issues** pose moderate risk: data privacy/security and IP protection are material given Adobe’s large online platforms. On the flip side, Adobe’s track record of platform reliability and strong governance mitigate these. Adverse currency swings or tax changes could affect profit forecasts (Adobe noted a FY25 FX ~\$200 m headwind ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=Financial%20Targets))). Overall, such risks justify our “High” uncertainty stance.

### Capital Allocation  
Adobe’s capital allocation has been **disciplined and shareholder-friendly**. The firm generates ~\$8 b operating cash flow per year ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005354/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2022-Revenue#:~:text=%2413.71%20on%20a%20non,cash%20flows%20during%20the%20year)) ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=%248)) and has used excess cash primarily for buybacks. In FY2024 it repurchased ~17.5M shares ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241211684094/en/Adobe-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Fiscal-2024-Revenue#:~:text=%248)), and in FY25 has continued heavy repurchases (≈7.0M in Q1 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000052/adbeex991q125.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Adobe%20repurchased%20approximately%207,shares%20during%20the%20quarter)), 8.6M in Q2 ([www.financialcontent.com](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/bizwire-2025-6-12-adobe-reports-record-revenue-in-q2-and-raises-fy25-revenue-and-eps-targets#:~:text=,million%20shares%20during%20the%20quarter))). Debt is moderate (~\$4.1 b end-2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ADBE/adobe/long-term-debt#:~:text=%28Millions%20of%20US%20%24%29%20,%243%2C629))) against \$7.9 b cash, yielding net cash. No dividends are paid (standard for growth tech). We rate allocation as **A**: Adobe prioritizes efficient share repurchase (benefiting remaining shareholders) and maintains financial flexibility. Acquisition spend has been modest post-Figma (focused on smaller, bolt-on deals) ensuring capital is not wasted. The firm’s large buyback and low leverage reflect a shareholder-aligned strategy.

### ESG Risk  
Sustainalytics rates Adobe’s ESG Risk as **14.2 (Low)** ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/adobe-inc/1007902567#:~:text=14)). This places Adobe in the top ~5% of software peers (rank 50/947) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/adobe-inc/1007902567#:~:text=Industry%20Group%20,risk)). Management scores well (robust policies) and exposure is low overall ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/adobe-inc/1007902567#:~:text=Adobe%2C%20Inc)). Key environmental/Social/Governance issues for Adobe include data privacy/security (user data protections) and human capital management (diversity, employee well-being) – typical for software firms. Its digital delivery model means direct environmental footprint is limited. No major ESG controversies have been reported recently. Overall, Adobe’s low ESG risk factor suggests sustainability issues are not a significant near-term threat.

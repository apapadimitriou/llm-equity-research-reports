### Analyst Note  
CrowdStrike delivered strong FY2025 results, with total revenue of **$3.95B (+29% YoY)** and subscription revenue of $3.76B (+31%) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations)). Ending ARR reached **$4.24B (+23%)** ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations)), driven by $224M of net-new ARR in the quarter ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%2A%20Ending%20ARR%20grows%2023,year)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations)). Non-GAAP EPS was **$3.93** (up from $3.09 prior year) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=to%C2%A0CrowdStrike%C2%A0was%C2%A0%24987,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)), while free cash flow hit a record **$1.07B** ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)). Management noted that operating cash flow was $1.38B for the year ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)) and reiterated its goal of **$10B ARR** by FY2029 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDelivering%C2%A0%24224%20million%C2%A0of%20net%20new%20ARR%2C,native%20SOC%20for%20today%20and)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=Commenting%20on%20the%20company%27s%20financial,term%20profitable%20growth)), suggesting confidence in the long-term growth plan.  CrowdStrike guided FY2026 revenue to $4.743–4.806B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)) (≈21–22% growth) with non-GAAP EPS of ~$3.39–3.45. Key drivers include strong module adoption and high retention (97% gross retention ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=combined%20ending%20ARR.%20With%2097,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow))) as customers consolidate on the Falcon platform.  However, the stock trades at rich multiples relative to peers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-shares-drop-windows-outage-fallout-hits-forecast-2025-06-04/#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20currently%20trades%20at%20a,Palo%20Alto%20Networks%20and%20Zscaler)), and management acknowledged that the July outage impact will pressure Q1 and FY2026 results ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-shares-drop-windows-outage-fallout-hits-forecast-2025-06-04/#:~:text=extended%20services,expected%20through%20the%20rest%20of)).  We retain a balanced outlook: CrowdStrike remains a cybersecurity leader with robust demand and innovation, but valuations imply near-perfect execution. 

### Business Description  
CrowdStrike is a cloud-native cybersecurity company providing a unified security platform (Falcon) for enterprises worldwide ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/crowdstrike-holdings-inc/2000243390#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20is%20a%20cloud,and%20went%20public%20in%202019)). Its flagship Falcon platform integrates endpoint protection, cloud workload security, identity protection, and next-generation SIEM/analytics.  The company sells these services via subscription (80% gross margin ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations))), with the vast majority of revenue coming from recurring software fees.  CrowdStrike is headquartered in Austin, Texas (founded 2011) and employs ~10,000 staff globally ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/crowdstrike-holdings-inc/2000243390#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20is%20a%20cloud,and%20went%20public%20in%202019)) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/crowdstrike-holdings-inc/2000243390#:~:text=Full%20time%20employees%3A%2010%2C363)).  Large enterprises and government agencies subscribe to Falcon’s modules (for example, cloud security, identity security and SIEM together accounted for ~$850M ARR in FY2024 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024?utm_source=perplexity#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D))).  In short, CrowdStrike’s business is selling a broadly adopted, AI-driven cybersecurity platform to organizations seeking to consolidate multiple point tools into one cloud solution.

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
CrowdStrike’s strategy is to build out its “AI-native” Falcon platform and drive cross-sell among modules.  The company invests heavily in R&D, recently acquiring Blumira and Adaptive Shield (~$300M) to enhance SaaS and identity capabilities ([www.calcalist.co.il](https://www.calcalist.co.il/ctechnews/article/s1zuniozkx#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20giant%20CrowdStrike%20is%20acquiring,million%20for%20the%20Israeli%20company)).  Its subscription model (Falcon Flex) incentivizes customers to add more modules over multi-year term, deepening integration.  For example, about 60% of signed Falcon Flex commitments have already been deployed, reflecting high stickiness .  Management touts the company as a “cybersecurity consolidator of choice” ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024?utm_source=perplexity#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)), and aims to leverage its data advantage: CrowdStrike’s massive threat dataset (“Falcon Complete”) creates a network effect that competitors cannot easily replicate ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crowdstrike-crwd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=dataset%20with%20millions%20of%20Falcon,threat%20data%20contextualized%20and%20actionable)).  The firm’s medium-term outlook assumes continued strong demand—IDC forecasts global cybersecurity spending to rise ~12% in 2025 ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/03/28/idc-cybersecurity-spending-2025/#:~:text=Global%20cybersecurity%20spending%20is%20expected,spending%20will%20continue%20through%202028))—as organizations face more threats and seek AI-enabled protection.

Over the next few years, we expect revenue growth to decelerate gradually (management targets ~20%+ CAGR through 2026) as the base scales, while profitability improves with scale.  Podbere (CFO) has signaled a path toward “profitably scaling the business” to their $10B ARR goal ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=Commenting%20on%20the%20company%27s%20financial,term%20profitable%20growth)). We assume non-GAAP operating margins (after stock comp) will stay around low-20s% near term, rising to mid-20s% by 2029.  CrowdStrike’s use of strategic acquisitions (e.g. Falcon Shield for identity, managed XDR through Falcon Complete) and global partnerships supports this expansion.  However, execution risk is elevated: meeting ambitious growth targets requires continued innovation and market leadership.  Cybersecurity competition remains intense (players like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Zscaler and Microsoft are all vying in key segments), and customers will demand demonstrable ROI and stability from their providers.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
- **Bulls Say:** CrowdStrike is taking share through its advanced, modular platform.  Subscription revenue grew ~30% in FY2025 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations)), and gross retention is ~97% ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=combined%20ending%20ARR.%20With%2097,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow)), indicating very sticky customers.  New product angles (e.g. Cloud Security, Identity Protection) are scaling – management notes these together exceed $1.3B ARR .  The shift to the Falcon Flex subscription model has unlocked large deal sizes (Falcon Flex deal value surged to $2.5B in Q4, up 10× year-over-year ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crowdstrike-crwd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=statements%2C%20whether%20as%20a%20result,GAAP))).  Free cash flow is healthy ($1.07B in FY2025 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024))) and the firm has net cash of ~$3.6B, providing resources for R&D or disciplined M&A.  Long-term tailwinds (global cyber spend up ~12% in 2025 ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/03/28/idc-cybersecurity-spending-2025/#:~:text=Global%20cybersecurity%20spending%20is%20expected,spending%20will%20continue%20through%202028))) and AI-driven security requirements should sustain growth. Management remains confident (“flight path to $10B ARR” ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDelivering%C2%A0%24224%20million%C2%A0of%20net%20new%20ARR%2C,native%20SOC%20for%20today%20and))) and continues to raise guidance during strong quarters.  

- **Bears Say:** The stock’s valuation already reflects almost-unlimited growth – Reuters notes CrowdStrike now trades at a high premium to peers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-shares-drop-windows-outage-fallout-hits-forecast-2025-06-04/#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20currently%20trades%20at%20a,Palo%20Alto%20Networks%20and%20Zscaler)).  Recent data points highlight execution risks.  The faulty July 2024 sensor update cost customers $11M of revenue and led to an investor class-action lawsuit (alleging CrowdStrike misled on the outage) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-shares-drop-windows-outage-fallout-hits-forecast-2025-06-04/#:~:text=extended%20services,expected%20through%20the%20rest%20of)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/01/crowdstrike-accused-of-defrauding-investors-in-class-action-lawsuit#:~:text=Share)).  In Q1 FY2026 guidance, management warned that this fallout will continue to depress growth, showing weakness in demand.  Meanwhile, large firewall and legacy security vendors are beefing up AI features, and well-funded startups (e.g. SentinelOne, SentinelOne-for Cloud) are targets to watch.  Cybersecurity budgets could see cuts if the macroeconomy slows; even skilled technologists may adopt open-source or do-it-yourself solutions.  Finally, delivering on the high-margin “model” (for example, >30% FCF margin by 2029) is far from guaranteed, given the fast-paced threat environment and crowded market.

### Economic Moat  
CrowdStrike’s moat is primarily driven by *customer switching costs* and *network effects from its threat data*.  Its high retention (~97% gross retention ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=combined%20ending%20ARR.%20With%2097,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow))) and increasing module uptake suggest customers find it hard to replace Falcon once integrated. Management highlights that CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence database (Falcon Complete) contains unique, outsourced telemetry from millions of endpoints – “no one else has this” rich dataset ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crowdstrike-crwd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=dataset%20with%20millions%20of%20Falcon,threat%20data%20contextualized%20and%20actionable)). This proprietary data, refined with AI, boosts detection efficacy and lock-in.  The company’s cloud-native approach also enables efficient multi-tenant scale, sustaining ~80% subscription gross margins ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20income%20from%20operations)).  These factors support a **Narrow moat** rating: CrowdStrike has a competitive advantage from its brand and data, but the fast-evolving tech landscape and strong competitors prevent a Wider moat.  For example, its newly launched AI assistant “Charlotte” (for incident triage) leverages Falcon’s data advantage ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crowdstrike-crwd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=And%20for%20security%2C%20it%27s%20even,operations%20and%20threat%20response%20times)), deepening the gap versus legacy tools. Overall, evidence of broad platform consolidation and superior analytics underpins a sustainable edge, albeit with close peers 

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our valuation assumes continued high growth but gradually slowing over time. We model FY2025–29 revenue CAGR ≈20–25%, anchored by the implied FY2026 guidance of $4.74–4.81B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)) (≈21% growth). Key profit drivers include steep subscription gross margins (~80%) and improving operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating income grew from $660M in FY2024 to $838M in FY2025 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024?utm_source=perplexity#:~:text=,2%20million%2C%20compared)), on stable ~21% margins. We forecast non-GAAP operating margin rising into the mid-20s% by FY2029 as operating expenses grow slower than revenue. We use a WACC of ≈10% and a 3% terminal growth rate. Our DCF yields a fair equity value near **$450/share**, implying modest upside from the current price. Implied multiples are high (on our FY2026 EPS of ~$3.40, P/E ~132× and P/S ~95×), reflecting assumptions of sustained high growth. For context, Palo Alto Networks trades at ~120× P/E ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/stock-price-history#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,26.88)) and Zscaler even higher, illustrating that investors expect CrowdStrike to eventually achieve similar scale. We note that our model embeds $10–15B in ARR by 2029 and ~30%+ free cash flow margins by then, consistent with the company’s long-term targets.

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Risks include a potential slowdown in enterprise IT spending and increased price competition, which could pressure bookings and renewals. The July 2024 service outage highlights operational risk – management disclosed it shaved $11M off early revenues ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/crowdstrike-shares-drop-windows-outage-fallout-hits-forecast-2025-06-04/#:~:text=extended%20services,expected%20through%20the%20rest%20of)), and lingering customer resistance could impede growth. Cyber breaches or platform failures could damage reputation, given CrowdStrike’s high-profile client base (e.g. government agencies). Technologically, reliance on cloud infrastructure poses security and compliance challenges (data privacy and evolving regulation in the U.S. and EU).  Finally, as a primarily U.S.-based firm, adverse shifts in trade policies or a global economic downturn could dampen international sales. These factors could materially affect valuations if they lead to slower growth or higher costs than expected.

### Capital Allocation  
CrowdStrike maintains a very strong balance sheet. As of Jan 31 2025, it held ~$4.32B in cash and equivalents ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,32%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0January%2031%2C%202025)) with only ~$0.74B of long-term debt (net cash ~$3.6B).  Management has no regular dividend or buyback plan, reflecting a focus on reinvestment.  The company deploys cash for organic R&D and selective M&A: for example, it is acquiring Adaptive Shield (identity/SaaS security) for about **$300M** ([www.calcalist.co.il](https://www.calcalist.co.il/ctechnews/article/s1zuniozkx#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20giant%20CrowdStrike%20is%20acquiring,million%20for%20the%20Israeli%20company)).  Capex is modest (~3–4% of revenue) as a SaaS provider. We expect continued disciplined use of capital: excess cash and future free cash flows likely fund investments or bolt-on deals rather than large shareholder returns.  Overall we rate capital allocation as **Standard** – strong liquidity and no debt are positives, but the absence of a clear shareholder return policy and ongoing need to invest for growth limit it to a neutral assessment.

### ESG Risk  
Sustainalytics assigns CrowdStrike an ESG Risk Score of **18.6** (Low risk) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/crowdstrike-holdings-inc/2000243390#:~:text=18)).  In ESG metrics, CrowdStrike’s environmental footprint is minimal, but social/governance factors include product reliability and cybersecurity ethics.  The July 2024 outage has led to class-action litigation ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/01/crowdstrike-accused-of-defrauding-investors-in-class-action-lawsuit#:~:text=Share)), which Sustainalytics notes as a social risk issue.  By comparison, a peer like Palo Alto Networks has a lower risk (~13.9, negligible category).  Material ESG considerations include data privacy and compliance (customer data protection), the ethical use of AI in security, and workplace practices.  CrowdStrike’s management scores ‘Average’ on ESG integration per Sustainalytics, and the company publishes an annual ESG report (no major controversies in environment or labor).  Overall, its ESG profile is favorable, with the primary concerns in Product Security and Governance (ensuring reliable service and transparency).

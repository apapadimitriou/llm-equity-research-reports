### Analyst Note
Nvidia’s share price and financial performance surged in 2025 amid unprecedented demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In July, Nvidia became the first company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization as investors bet on its dominant role in AI hardware ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-notches-4-trillion-record-close-market-cap-2025-07-10/#:~:text=On%20July%2010%2C%202025%2C%20Nvidia%27s,Nvidia%E2%80%99s%20powerful%20processors%20are)). Fiscal first-quarter 2025 results (reported May 2025) saw revenue jump 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, with net income rising 26% to $18.8 billion despite a $4.5 billion export-related charge ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/77c031067a61996ef4baa2ae3eb10a81#:~:text=concerns%20around%20U,billion%20loss%20in%20Chinese%20sales)). The data center segment – supplying GPU accelerators for AI model training – contributed about $39 billion in Q1 (nearly 90% of sales) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=tailoring%20its%20Hopper%20chips%20for,a%20restrictive%20AI%20diffusion%20rule)). Management noted that global AI infrastructure investment remains robust, with new deals in the Middle East and Asia helping offset the impact of U.S.-China export curbs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=was%20about%20%2439,quarter%20revenue)). In fact, on July 15 Nvidia’s stock jumped ~5% after the U.S. moved to approve licenses for its high-end H20 AI chips to China ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nasdaq-sp-500-futures-gain-ground-with-earnings-inflation-spotlight-2025-07-15/#:~:text=On%20July%2015%2C%202025%2C%20the,quarter%20earnings%20also%20drew)), potentially restoring a revenue stream that was previously at risk.

We update our investment thesis to reflect Nvidia’s accelerating growth and durable competitive position. Nvidia’s latest **GPU** lineup (Hopper architecture and forthcoming Blackwell chips) continues to set industry benchmarks in AI performance, reinforcing its near-monopoly in advanced AI accelerators. Meanwhile, the company’s ecosystem – including its proprietary CUDA software – deepens customer lock-in and supports a **wide economic moat** (see Moat section). We believe Nvidia is positioned to monetize the multi-year “AI revolution” across cloud, enterprise, and edge computing. Our fundamental outlook remains positive, but we note that the stock’s sharp rally (shares up roughly eightfold since 2021 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-set-become-worlds-most-valuable-company-history-2025-07-03/#:~:text=while%20Apple%20dropped%20to%20third,retirement%20funds%20and%20market%20indices))) has elevated expectations. We maintain a long-term **fair value estimate** of $125 per share ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=265302#:~:text=,Morningstar%20Uncertainty%20Rating%3A%20Very%20High)), which implies the stock is somewhat overvalued at the current price. We anticipate sustained growth driven by AI chip demand, while monitoring potential headwinds from competition and regulatory actions.

### Business Description
Nvidia is a leading fabless semiconductor company specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs) and related software. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia initially focused on 3D graphics for gaming. Today, it operates globally and generates revenue from several platforms: **Data Center**, which includes AI accelerators for cloud and enterprise; **Gaming**, including GeForce GPU chips for PC gaming; **Professional Visualization** for workstations; **Automotive** solutions for autonomous driving; and OEM & other. In recent years, data center has become Nvidia’s largest segment by far, comprising roughly 80–90% of revenue in early 2025 amid surging AI demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=tailoring%20its%20Hopper%20chips%20for,a%20restrictive%20AI%20diffusion%20rule)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-posts-record-usd44-billion-revenue-h20-export-ban-bites-as-gaming-rises#:~:text=Gaming%20revenue%20reached%20a%20record,down%20related%20to)). Nvidia designs its chips in-house and outsources fabrication to third-party foundries (primarily TSMC). The company sells to a concentrated customer base of technology firms and cloud computing providers, with a sizeable portion of sales in North America and Asia (including China when permitted by export laws). Nvidia’s products are often sold as accelerator cards and integrated systems, complemented by its CUDA software platform and developer tools that enable broad applications from supercomputing to artificial intelligence.

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Nvidia’s strategy centers on maintaining its technological leadership in accelerated computing and expanding the use of GPUs beyond graphics into **AI**, data science, and other high-performance computing areas. Under the visionary leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia successfully pivoted from gaming to AI over the past decade ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8f0e4f65-5e51-428d-b263-8716cd11555b#:~:text=Nvidia%2C%20originally%20a%20graphics%20chip,The)). The firm’s “full-stack” approach – designing not just chips but also the software (CUDA libraries, AI frameworks) and hardware systems – has created a virtuous cycle: developers build AI models optimized for Nvidia’s platform, which in turn drives more customers to Nvidia’s GPUs. This strategy has reshaped computing, as Nvidia’s parallel processing capabilities proved essential for training generative AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8f0e4f65-5e51-428d-b263-8716cd11555b#:~:text=player%20in%20the%20artificial%20intelligence,The)). Looking ahead, Nvidia aims to sustain its first-mover advantage in AI by launching successive GPU architectures (e.g. Blackwell in 2025) and specialized chips for emerging uses. It is also investing in networking (e.g. high-speed interconnects from the Mellanox acquisition) and software services to cement its role in data center infrastructure.

We anticipate Nvidia will enjoy several years of strong growth supported by secular trends. Enterprises and cloud providers are racing to build AI capabilities, underpinning robust demand for Nvidia’s data center products. The company’s **outlook** calls for continued revenue expansion, though at a decelerating pace after the recent explosive surge. Having grown annual revenue from about $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/77c031067a61996ef4baa2ae3eb10a81#:~:text=the%20company%20grow%20its%20annual,billion%20in%20just%20two%20years)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/1063d50f560f48c04fb97539d566c46e#:~:text=quarter%20revenue%2C%20up%2078,S%26P%20500%27s%20gain%20last%20year)), Nvidia is now entering a phase where supply constraints are easing and customers are scaling up AI deployments. We expect high-margin data center sales to remain the primary growth driver, supplemented by a recovery in gaming GPUs (as new GeForce RTX 40-series products address prior shortages ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-posts-record-usd44-billion-revenue-h20-export-ban-bites-as-gaming-rises#:~:text=Nvidia%20reported%20a%20record%20%2444,export%20restrictions%20to%20China%20significantly))) and longer-term opportunities in automotive and edge AI. Over the next 3–5 years, Nvidia’s challenge will be to stay ahead of competition and avoid commoditization. However, given its unparalleled R&D budget and ecosystem, we believe Nvidia can defend its turf. Overall, we project a revenue CAGR in the mid-teens through fiscal 2029 (after a >100% spike in FY2025), with operating margins remaining robust (50%+ range) as economies of scale in chip design offset rising costs. 

### Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say:**  
1. Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, effectively the “arms dealer” for the AI boom. Its GPUs are mission-critical for training and running AI models at scale, which has led to exponential revenue growth (data center sales rose from $3 billion in 2020 to over $110 billion in 2025) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=265302#:~:text=Our%20fair%20value%20estimate%2C%20and,DC%20revenue%20remains%20supply)). Bulls argue that this dominant position will translate into sustained pricing power and high volume growth as AI adoption spreads across industries.  
2. The company possesses an entrenched ecosystem of software and developers. Nvidia’s CUDA platform has over 4 million developers and 15 years of adoption ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/#:~:text=Nvidia%2C%20dominant%20in%20the%20AI,technical%20specs%20in%20the%20first)), creating high switching costs for customers who have built their AI workflows around Nvidia’s tools. This **intangible asset** and developer network effect should help Nvidia maintain its wide moat and fend off competing chip architectures ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/article.aspx?articleid=242855&categoryid=2110&lang=en-GB#:~:text=,customer%20switching%20costs%20around%20Cuda)).  
3. Financially, Nvidia’s execution has been stellar. The company enjoys gross margins around 70% and recently delivered record profits (net income of $14.9 billion in a single quarter) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/23/nvidia-profits-ai-stock-income-q1#:~:text=companies%20in%20the%20world%2C%20largely,companies%2C%20only%20Apple%2C%20Microsoft%2C%20and)), making it one of the most profitable companies globally. Despite the stock’s huge rally, bulls note that Nvidia’s valuation (around 33× forward earnings) is not unreasonable relative to its own growth or even historical multiples (it’s below Nvidia’s five-year average P/E of ~40) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-hits-record-high-analyst-predicts-ai-golden-wave-2025-06-25/#:~:text=demand%20for%20high,a%20period%20influenced%20by%20global)). With a fortress balance sheet and strong cash generation, Nvidia is well positioned to continue investing in innovation while also potentially returning cash to shareholders over time.

**Bears Say:**  
1. Nvidia’s stock price already reflects lofty expectations. The company’s market value topping $4 trillion implies very high earnings growth for many years to come. Bears warn that any slowdown in AI chip demand – for example, once cloud providers finish building out current AI capacity – could expose Nvidia’s rich valuation and lead to a sharp correction. The stock trades at over 30× forward earnings, which leaves little room for error if growth decelerates.  
2. Geopolitical and regulatory risks are a major concern. About 20–25% of Nvidia’s revenue has recently come from China; U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China already cost Nvidia an estimated $5 billion+ in lost sales ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/77c031067a61996ef4baa2ae3eb10a81#:~:text=concerns%20around%20U,billion%20loss%20in%20Chinese%20sales)). Tighter regulations or a deterioration in U.S.-China relations could further cut Nvidia off from the China market. Additionally, Nvidia’s 84% market share in AI chips ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-business-practices-eu-antitrust-spotlight-sources-say-2024-12-06/#:~:text=particularly%20whether%20the%20U,European%20Commission%20has%20sent%20out)) has drawn antitrust scrutiny in the EU and elsewhere, raising the risk of fines or business practice constraints that could erode its margins.  
3. Competition is on the horizon. While Nvidia currently enjoys a near-monopoly in cutting-edge AI accelerators, technology giants are investing heavily to challenge it. Advanced Micro Devices is rolling out competing GPU accelerators, and Google, Amazon, and others are developing in-house AI chips. A coalition led by Qualcomm and OpenAI is even working on open-source software to counter Nvidia’s CUDA dominance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/#:~:text=success%20not%20just%20to%20its,technical%20specs%20in%20the%20first)). Bears say these efforts, though trailing Nvidia today, could gradually chip away at Nvidia’s dominance, leading to pricing pressure and smaller market share by late decade. Any slippage in Nvidia’s technological lead – or loss of key talent under Jensen Huang – could fundamentally weaken the growth narrative.

### Economic Moat
We assign Nvidia a **wide economic moat**, driven by two primary sources: intangible assets and switching costs. On the intangible side, Nvidia has developed world-class expertise in GPU design and a software ecosystem that is virtually synonymous with AI computing. The firm’s proprietary CUDA software platform is a linchpin of its moat – it allows developers to efficiently program Nvidia GPUs for AI tasks, and over 4 million developers have adopted CUDA to date ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/#:~:text=Nvidia%2C%20dominant%20in%20the%20AI,source%20software%20compatible)). This large developer base and years of software optimization form a formidable barrier to entry. Would-be competitors not only need to match Nvidia’s hardware performance but also its rich software libraries and developer support. Nvidia’s strong brand and developer mindshare in AI further cement its intangible asset advantage.

Switching costs amplify the moat. Because so much of the AI industry’s code, tools, and skillsets are built around Nvidia’s platform, customers face significant hurdles in switching to an alternative. Data centers have optimized their infrastructure for Nvidia GPUs, and AI engineers are deeply familiar with Nvidia’s development environment. As Morningstar’s equity research notes, Nvidia benefits from high customer switching costs due to its integrated hardware-software ecosystem ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/article.aspx?articleid=242855&categoryid=2110&lang=en-GB#:~:text=,customer%20switching%20costs%20around%20Cuda)). Even leading cloud players that are investing in custom chips (e.g. Google TPUs or Amazon’s AWS Trainium) continue to rely on Nvidia for the bulk of their AI workloads, underscoring the stickiness of Nvidia’s solutions. We see no credible threat to Nvidia’s moat in the near term ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=265302#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20%24125%20fair,wide%20moat%20rating%20for%20Nvidia)). The company’s scale (>$130 billion revenue) supports R&D spending in the tens of billions, which few others can match, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation. Overall, we expect Nvidia to earn excess returns on capital for at least the next 20 years, consistent with a wide-moat rating.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
We estimate Nvidia’s intrinsic **fair value** at $125 per share, which equates to a market capitalization around $3 trillion ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=265302#:~:text=With%20its%203,share%2C%20which%20implies%20an%20equity)). This valuation is derived from a discounted cash flow model that projects robust, but moderating, growth in the coming years. After more than doubling from FY2024 to FY2025 (from ~$60 billion to $130.5 billion in revenue) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/1063d50f560f48c04fb97539d566c46e#:~:text=quarter%20revenue%2C%20up%2078,S%26P%20500%27s%20gain%20last%20year)), we forecast Nvidia’s top-line to grow at a **5-year CAGR** of about 15% through FY2029. This assumes FY2026 revenue of roughly $170 billion and FY2027 around $205 billion, followed by high-single-digit percentage growth in FY2028–29 as the AI chip market matures. Key **profit drivers** include data center GPU sales (by far the largest contributor), which we expect to drive the majority of revenue growth, and a gradual recovery in gaming as new GPU product cycles stimulate upgrade demand. We model a long-term gross margin in the high-60s% and operating margin in the low-to-mid 50s%, reflecting some normalization from recent peaks as competition enters, but still bolstered by Nvidia’s pricing power and operating leverage. 

Our fair value implies price/earnings multiples that normalize over time. At $125, Nvidia would trade at about 32× our FY2026 adjusted EPS estimate and 26× FY2027 EPS ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=265302#:~:text=match%20at%20L78%20value%20of,earnings%20multiple%20of%2026%20times)), which we view as reasonable given the company’s growth and profitability profile. We use a **WACC** of approximately 9% to discount cash flows, incorporating a higher equity risk premium due to Nvidia’s exposure to geopolitical risk (China) and cyclicality. We assume a **terminal growth** rate of ~4%, reflecting continued AI adoption but a more competitive landscape in the long run. Under these assumptions, our $125 fair value corresponds to an enterprise value/EBITDA of ~20× on FY2025 and a free cash flow yield around 3%. We believe these metrics appropriately balance Nvidia’s extraordinary near-term growth with the uncertainties of maintaining its trajectory. In sum, the stock appears about 30–40% overvalued relative to our fair value, and the current market price (~$164) implies exceedingly optimistic scenarios. While we remain confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals, we would prefer a greater margin of safety before considering the stock a buy at current levels.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Nvidia faces elevated **uncertainty**, with several factors that could cause its future results to diverge from our base case. **Macroeconomic risk:** A global economic slowdown or cutbacks in capital spending by major cloud providers could dampen demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips. Given Nvidia’s large deals with a handful of hyperscale customers, any hesitation or delay in AI infrastructure investment (for example, due to higher interest rates or tech budget constraints) would directly impact Nvidia’s growth. **Regulatory and geopolitical risk:** This is among the most prominent concerns. In late 2024, U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips to China forced Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion inventory write-down and forecast an $8 billion revenue hit for 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=chips%20ahead%20of%20newly%20imposed,beating%20expectations)). While some restrictions have eased (licenses for H20 chips were granted in mid-2025), U.S.-China tensions remain fluid. There is a risk of tighter bans or Chinese retaliation (e.g., restricting rare earth materials or imposing sanctions on U.S. chip firms). Furthermore, Nvidia’s heavy reliance on Taiwan’s TSMC for manufacturing is a strategic vulnerability – TSMC produces 80–90% of Nvidia’s chips in Taiwan ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-it-has-discussed-moving-fabs-out-taiwan-such-move-impossible-2024-06-04/#:~:text=Taiwan%20Semiconductor%20Manufacturing%20Co%20,a%20significant%20concern%20at%20the)), so any escalation of cross-strait conflict or a disruption to TSMC’s operations (natural disaster, etc.) could cripple Nvidia’s supply chain. Nvidia is attempting to mitigate this by investing in U.S. production capacity ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985#:~:text=2025,This%20move%20aligns)), but meaningful diversification will take years.

**Competitive and technological risk:** Although Nvidia currently leads in AI accelerators, the semiconductor industry is fiercely competitive. Rival chip designers (AMD, Intel startups) and large tech companies are pouring resources into alternative AI chips. If a competitor developed a GPU or AI accelerator with superior price/performance, or if a novel computing paradigm (such as quantum computing or new AI algorithms less dependent on GPUs) emerged, Nvidia’s growth and pricing power could falter. Additionally, the software ecosystem advantage Nvidia enjoys could be eroded if an open-standard alternative to CUDA gains traction (a collaborative initiative is underway to promote open AI software standards ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/#:~:text=success%20not%20just%20to%20its,technical%20specs%20in%20the%20first))). **Regulatory antitrust action** is another risk: authorities in the EU, US, and China are reviewing Nvidia’s business practices given its 84% market share in AI chips ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-business-practices-eu-antitrust-spotlight-sources-say-2024-12-06/#:~:text=particularly%20whether%20the%20U,European%20Commission%20has%20sent%20out)). Potential outcomes could include fines or forced changes to how Nvidia bundles products (the EU is examining whether Nvidia ties software with hardware unfairly). While such actions wouldn’t undermine Nvidia’s technology, they could limit certain sales strategies or marginally increase costs. **ESG and other risks:** Nvidia’s operations and supply chain carry some environmental and social risks – for instance, the energy-intensive chip manufacturing process (handled by suppliers like TSMC) and the use of conflict minerals. Any controversies in these areas, or governance issues (e.g., a lack of board independence or key-person risk around CEO Jensen Huang ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8f0e4f65-5e51-428d-b263-8716cd11555b#:~:text=overreliance%20on%20Huang%2C%20its%20dependency,and%20spearheading%20the%20AI%20era))), could negatively affect Nvidia’s reputation and valuation. Overall, we classify Nvidia’s uncertainty as **Very High**, appropriate for a company with significant exposure to external risks and whose valuation hinges on continued exceptional growth.

### Capital Allocation
We rate Nvidia’s capital allocation as **Exemplary**, reflecting a strong balance sheet, disciplined investment strategy, and shareholder-friendly policies. Nvidia has virtually no net debt and generates substantial free cash flow (over $30 billion in the last year). Management has primarily reinvested these funds into growth – both organically via R&D and capacity commitments, and through selective acquisitions – with outstanding results. CEO Jensen Huang has a track record of prescient strategic moves, such as the early bet on AI GPUs and the acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 (which expanded Nvidia’s data center capabilities in high-speed networking). These investments have yielded immense payoffs, evidenced by Nvidia’s ROIC far exceeding its cost of capital in recent years. For example, in fiscal 2025 Nvidia earned roughly $22 billion in net income in the fourth quarter alone ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/26/nvidia-q4-earnings-jensen-huang-ai#:~:text=2025,quarter%20ending%20January%2026%20was)), pushing its full-year ROIC well above historical norms. The attempted $40 billion Arm acquisition in 2020 (which was terminated due to regulators) could be seen as an overambitious move, but we view it as a strategic opportunity that Nvidia wisely walked away from when conditions soured – a sign of discipline in M&A.

Nvidia’s balance sheet strength gives it flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. The company has maintained a modest dividend (currently yielding <0.1%) and uses opportunistic share buybacks; notably, it refrained from excessive buybacks during 2022’s downturn and instead accelerated repurchases in 2023-24 when cash flows exploded. This suggests management focuses on long-term value rather than short-term stock boosts. We also note that Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock **split** in 2024 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/507372e976ad788900202eda054b86f4#:~:text=2024,a%20share%20price%20over%20%241%2C000)), which, while not affecting intrinsic value, improved the stock’s liquidity and facilitated its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/edc5430cad4696c650b5cb2e4fd2d0bf#:~:text=Nvidia%20will%20replace%20Intel%20on,has%20also)). In terms of governance, Jensen Huang’s leadership is visionary, though the company is effectively founder-led which carries some key-person risk. Nonetheless, the board has overseen prudent financial policies, and Nvidia’s clear strategic direction implies sound capital allocation. The company is now committing substantial capital to secure future supply – Huang announced plans to spend ~$500 billion over the next four years on U.S. supply chain and capacity expansion ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985#:~:text=2025,This%20move%20aligns)) – a move we view as forward-thinking given geopolitical risks. In summary, Nvidia’s exemplary capital allocation is evidenced by its balance sheet resilience, high-return investments, and shareholder-conscious actions.

**Note:** FY2022–2024 figures are historical actuals (FY2024 revenue more than doubled to ~$60 billion) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/1063d50f560f48c04fb97539d566c46e#:~:text=quarter%20revenue%2C%20up%2078,S%26P%20500%27s%20gain%20last%20year)). FY2025–2029 are analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s fiscal year ends in late January; for example, FY2025 ended on Jan 26, 2025 and reported revenue of $130.5 billion. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures. ROIC is return on invested capital, approximated here as NOPAT divided by beginning-of-year invested capital.

### ESG Risk
Nvidia’s overall **ESG risk profile** is relatively low for its industry. Morningstar Sustainalytics assigns Nvidia an ESG Risk Rating score of 12 (categorized as **“Low” risk), which ranks 4th out of 377 semiconductor companies globally ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/nvidia-corp/1007910553#:~:text=Company%20%20,6%20out%20of%20377)). This indicates that while Nvidia has exposure to certain industry-specific ESG issues, the company is managing them effectively such that residual risk to shareholders is modest. Nvidia has made public commitments to environmental sustainability, including targets for greenhouse gas reduction and energy efficiency. Its GPUs are designed to deliver more computing performance per watt with each generation, contributing to energy savings for data center customers. Nvidia also emphasizes responsible sourcing of minerals and has programs to ensure supplier compliance with labor and ethics standards. These efforts have kept the company largely free of major ESG controversies in recent years (Sustainalytics currently flags no severe controversies for Nvidia).

That said, there are material ESG issues to monitor. On the **environmental** front, the manufacturing of Nvidia’s chips (done by partners like TSMC) is energy- and water-intensive, and increasing production could raise Nvidia’s indirect (Scope 3) carbon footprint. The company’s push to localize some supply chain in the U.S. may help mitigate geopolitical risk but could shift environmental impacts. For **social** factors, Nvidia’s products have potential dual-use implications – its high-performance chips can be used in surveillance, defense, or other sensitive applications. The company must ensure compliance with export laws and human rights considerations when selling to certain governments or end-users (recent U.S. export controls to China underscore this point). Internally, like many tech firms, Nvidia faces scrutiny on workforce diversity and inclusion; its leadership remains predominantly male and Asian, and continued improvements in diversity metrics will be expected by ESG-minded investors. Regarding **governance**, Nvidia has a strong innovation-focused culture but also a founder-led structure. Jensen Huang serves as both CEO and (recently) board chairman, which consolidates power and could be viewed as a governance risk if checks and balances are not robust. So far, the board has a good mix of independent directors, and Nvidia’s governance track record is solid (aside from a past SEC fine over inadequate crypto-related disclosures in 2018). Overall, Nvidia’s ESG risk is well-managed and not a significant drag on its investment appeal – the company’s **ESG Risk Rating** firmly places it in the low-risk tier, slightly better than peer AMD (score ~12.5) and much better than older semiconductor peers that may have legacy environmental liabilities.

### Appendix
**Key Valuation Assumptions:** Our DCF model uses a **9% WACC** (reflecting roughly a 10% cost of equity and Nvidia’s minimal debt). We assume a **terminal growth rate** of ~4% beyond 2029, given the still-large runway for AI in global IT spending. Margins are expected to peak in FY2025–2026 and gradually normalize; we project **long-term operating margin** settling around 45–50% (vs. ~55% near-term) as competition increases. Working capital needs are assumed to rise slightly (inventory build to secure supply), and annual **CapEx** plus capital lease commitments (largely pre-paying foundry capacity) are modeled around 5–6% of revenue, in line with management’s plan to invest heavily in supply chain. **Tax rate** is assumed at 13–15%, reflecting Nvidia’s mix of U.S. and international income and current corporate tax laws. Share count is assumed roughly stable; we expect that options/RSU dilution will be offset by share buybacks over time. 

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- **Economic Moat** – This is Morningstar’s assessment of the strength and duration of a firm’s competitive advantages. A “Wide” moat rating means we expect Nvidia to earn excess returns on capital for at least 20 years, thanks to sustainable advantages (e.g. technology leadership and ecosystem lock-in). A “Narrow” moat would indicate advantages likely lasting 10 years, and “None” means little to no sustainable advantage.  
- **Uncertainty Rating** – This reflects the predictability of the company’s future cash flows. Nvidia’s “Very High” uncertainty rating implies a wide range of possible future outcomes (due to factors like volatile demand, geopolitical risk, etc.), necessitating a larger margin of safety for investors. Lower uncertainty categories (High, Medium, Low) would correspond to more stable businesses where future earnings are easier to forecast.  
- **Capital Allocation Rating** – This rating gauges management’s effectiveness at investing capital and balancing the interests of shareholders. “Exemplary” indicates we believe Nvidia’s management has a strong track record of value-enhancing investments, prudent use of debt, and appropriate shareholder returns. A “Standard” rating would mean capital allocation is average/acceptable, and “Poor” would flag consistent missteps or governance concerns in the use of capital.

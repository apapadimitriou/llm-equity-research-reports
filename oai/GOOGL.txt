### Analyst Note  
Alphabet’s first-quarter 2025 results eased market concerns over digital ad weakness, as revenue rose 12% year-on-year to $90.2 billion and EPS of $2.81 beat consensus by 40% ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=The%20search%20giant%27s%20first,also%20rose%20in%20aftermarket%20trading)) ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=unit%20to%20report%20revenue%20of,The%20firm%20also%20said)). Advertising sales grew a solid 8.5% (vs. 7.7% expected) despite macro headwinds ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20Google%27s%20mainstay%20ad,a%20trade%20rule%20allowing%20low)), highlighting sustained demand for Google’s search and YouTube ad platforms. Management’s confidence is underscored by a new **$70 billion share buyback** authorization ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Alphabet%20beat%20Q1%20profit%20and,continued%20growth%20and%20infrastructure%20expansion)) and reaffirmed **$75 billion 2025 capital expenditure** plan focused on AI and cloud infrastructure ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=after%20market%20and%20adding%20%2475,also%20rose%20in%20aftermarket%20trading)). Alphabet’s stock jumped about 4% after Q1 earnings on these strong fundamentals ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Alphabet%20beat%20Q1%20profit%20and,continued%20growth%20and%20infrastructure%20expansion)), yet the shares still trade roughly 25–30% below our intrinsic value estimate of $237 ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%3A%20We%20raise,capacity%20comes%20online%20in%202025)), indicating a sizable margin of safety.  

We expect **AI advancements** to reinforce Alphabet’s competitive edge rather than undermine it. The company has rapidly rolled out generative AI features (e.g. an “AI mode” in Search) that enhance user experience and ad targeting ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/alphabet-hits-near-three-month-high-new-ai-updates-2025-05-22/#:~:text=Alphabet%20Inc.%20shares%20surged%204,AI%20can%20help%20deliver%20more)). Alphabet reports that **AI-driven search overviews** already engage 1.5 billion users monthly ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=offers%20advertisers%20the%20ability%20to,an%20analyst%20at%20Edward%20Jones)), helping maintain robust search traffic. Meanwhile, **Google Cloud** revenue growth, while decelerated to 28% in Q1 ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20reported%20a%2028,The%20firm%20also%20said)), is poised to reaccelerate once new data center capacity comes online later in 2025 ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=monetization%20despite%20its%20launch%20just,forecast%20growth%20to%20inflect%20upward)). This should improve cloud’s profitability and contribute to expansion of group operating margins. Alphabet’s wide moat in search, its burgeoning cloud and subscription businesses, and disciplined capital returns support a favorable risk/reward profile. In the near term, investor sentiment may remain cautious amid pending antitrust rulings and heavy AI investment spending, but we believe Alphabet’s long-term outlook remains intact. **We reiterate our view that Alphabet is undervalued, with resilient core profits and significant optionality in AI**. ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%3A%20We%20raise,capacity%20comes%20online%20in%202025)) ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20Google%27s%20mainstay%20ad,a%20trade%20rule%20allowing%20low))

### Business Description  
Alphabet is a global holding company that owns Google and an array of other businesses. Google generates **nearly 90% of Alphabet’s revenue** through its Google Services division ([tools.morningstarfunds.ie](https://tools.morningstarfunds.ie/ie/stockreport/default.aspx?SecurityToken=0P00012BBI%5D3%5D0%5DE0WWE%24%24ALL#:~:text=Alphabet%20is%20a%20holding%20company,cloud%20computing%20platform%2C%20or%20GCP)). This segment includes Google’s flagship **online advertising** business – comprising search ads, YouTube ads, and network ads – as well as revenue from consumer services like YouTube subscriptions, the Google Play app store, and hardware (Pixel devices, Chromecast, etc.) ([tools.morningstarfunds.ie](https://tools.morningstarfunds.ie/ie/stockreport/default.aspx?SecurityToken=0P00012BBI%5D3%5D0%5DE0WWE%24%24ALL#:~:text=Alphabet%20is%20a%20holding%20company,cloud%20computing%20platform%2C%20or%20GCP)). Alphabet's second-largest segment is **Google Cloud**, which contributed roughly 10% of revenue in 2024 ([tools.morningstarfunds.ie](https://tools.morningstarfunds.ie/ie/stockreport/default.aspx?SecurityToken=0P00012BBI%5D3%5D0%5DE0WWE%24%24ALL#:~:text=home%20products%20such%20as%20Chromecast%29,making%20up%20the%20rest)), offering cloud infrastructure and platform services. The remaining revenue comes from **Other Bets** – the company’s collection of nascent ventures in “moonshot” areas such as self-driving cars (Waymo), life sciences (Verily), and fiber broadband. These other segments currently generate minimal revenue and operate at a loss, funded by Google’s cash flows. Geographically, Alphabet earns about 47% of revenue from the United States, with the rest spread across international markets (notably EMEA and APAC) ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20Google%27s%20mainstay%20ad,a%20trade%20rule%20allowing%20low)). Despite its diversification, **advertising remains Alphabet’s economic engine**, supporting the development of its newer businesses.

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Alphabet’s strategy centers on sustaining its dominance in core platforms while investing aggressively in future technologies. In search and advertising, the firm continually improves its algorithms and integrates **artificial intelligence** to preserve Google’s ~90% global search market share ([www.hindustantimes.com](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/googles-search-engine-market-share-falls-below-90-for-first-time-since-2015-report-101736825898506.html#:~:text=In%20October%202024%2C%20Google%27s%20market,73)) and high user engagement. For example, Alphabet views generative AI as a tool to **augment search** rather than replace it – early data show Google’s AI search summaries have similar monetization potential as traditional search ads ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=,forecast%20growth%20to%20inflect%20upward)). This should help defend its search ad franchise even as AI-driven offerings from OpenAI and others emerge. The company is also leveraging AI **across YouTube and Google Cloud**, using machine learning to recommend content and to offer advanced cloud services, respectively.  

Management is focused on a **“user first” ecosystem approach**: keep consumers within the Google universe (Search, Android, YouTube, Maps, etc.) and monetize via targeted ads and subscriptions. This yields powerful network effects – billions of users attract millions of advertisers, which in turn fund improvements to services. Alphabet’s vast scale and data advantages feed into continuous refinement of its ad targeting, underpinning our expectation of **high-single-digit ad revenue growth** over the next five years. In cloud computing, Alphabet is pursuing a fast-follower strategy, significantly boosting capital expenditures to close the gap with Amazon and Microsoft ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=after%20market%20and%20adding%20%2475,also%20rose%20in%20aftermarket%20trading)). We foresee Google Cloud maintaining >25% growth as enterprises adopt its AI and analytics offerings, eventually improving its currently slim margins. Overall, Alphabet’s outlook is for **mid-teens EPS growth** driven by steady expansion in digital ad spending, rising cloud profitability, and disciplined cost control. Long-term secular trends – from AI, to mobile consumption, to cloud migration – all play to Alphabet’s strengths, reinforcing a positive growth trajectory.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls Say:**  
1. Alphabet’s **market dominance** in search (around 89–90% share globally) and video (YouTube’s massive user base) gives it unparalleled reach for advertisers ([www.hindustantimes.com](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/googles-search-engine-market-share-falls-below-90-for-first-time-since-2015-report-101736825898506.html#:~:text=In%20October%202024%2C%20Google%27s%20market,73)). Its cash-cow ad business should continue generating tens of billions in free cash flow annually ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/253438/alphabet-shares-fair-value-increased-%E2%80%93-despite-regulatory-pressure.aspx#:~:text=We%20view%20Alphabet%20as%20a,intelligence%2C%20video%2C%20and%20cloud%20computing)).  
2. The company is a leader in **AI and cloud computing**, positioning it to capture new revenue streams. Google Cloud’s 30%+ growth and AI services (e.g. Vertex AI) could meaningfully boost profits as these businesses scale ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20reported%20a%2028,The%20firm%20also%20said)).  
3. Alphabet’s **financial strength** is exceptional, with over $100 billion in cash and minimal debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=Long,4%2C694)). This allows sustained R&D in moonshots like Waymo while still returning cash to shareholders via large buybacks ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Alphabet%20beat%20Q1%20profit%20and,continued%20growth%20and%20infrastructure%20expansion)). The firm’s agility in innovation and savvy capital allocation support high returns on capital ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/research-report/alphabet-inc-research#:~:text=That%20smart%20spending%20gives%20Alphabet,uses%20its%20money%20very%20efficiently)).

**Bears Say:**  
1. **Generative AI competition** poses a threat to Google’s search empire. Rival offerings (ChatGPT, Bing AI and a potential Apple AI search tool) could divert queries and ad spend away from Google, eroding its core search advertising revenue ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-looks-add-ai-search-companys-browser-bloomberg-reports-2025-05-07/#:~:text=2025,an%20antitrust%20case%20against%20Alphabet)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/musk-asserts-ai-will-make-search-redundant-in-comment-on-google-search-share-dipping-below-90-percent#:~:text=In%20late%202024%2C%20Google%20Search%27s,driven%20search%20tools%2C%20prompting%20commentary)).  
2. Alphabet faces intensifying **regulatory pressure** globally. The U.S. DOJ antitrust lawsuit and EU regulations could force structural changes – for example, potential separation of Chrome or Android ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-plan-break-up-googles-search-dominance-threatens-profit-engine-ai-growth-2024-10-09/#:~:text=2024,These%20proposals)) – or impose fines and limits that undermine Google’s competitive advantages.  
3. The firm’s **ballooning expenses** and capital needs may hurt economic returns. Alphabet’s plan to spend $85 billion+ on AI and cloud capex in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/alphabet-jumps-ai-driven-spending-fuels-cloud-revenue-surge-2025-07-24/#:~:text=Alphabet%20shares%20rose%20nearly%203,next%20year%20to%20support%20AI)) will compress free cash flow in the near term. Its “Other Bets” have a mixed track record and continue to incur losses, which could drag on overall profitability if they don’t pan out.

### Economic Moat  
We assign Alphabet a **Wide economic moat**, built on multiple durable competitive advantages. First, Google’s dominance in global search is self-reinforcing: enormous scale yields better data and results, attracting more users, which in turn lure virtually all advertisers. Google processes ~8.5 billion searches per day and held about 89% worldwide search market share in late 2024 ([www.hindustantimes.com](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/googles-search-engine-market-share-falls-below-90-for-first-time-since-2015-report-101736825898506.html#:~:text=In%20October%202024%2C%20Google%27s%20market,73)) – an unparalleled lead that competitors struggle to chip away. This scale advantage underpins network effects in advertising, as businesses must advertise on Google to reach the largest audience. Second, Alphabet enjoys substantial **intangible assets**. Its core algorithms, engineering talent, and troves of user data serve as a high barrier to entry. Google’s cutting-edge AI research (e.g. Google Brain, DeepMind) and proprietary technologies (such as the PageRank algorithm) continuously improve its services, reinforcing user preference. Third, Alphabet’s ecosystem (Search, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, etc.) creates **high user switching costs**. Consumers and businesses are deeply embedded in Google’s products – often synchronized via Google accounts – making them less likely to switch to alternatives. For example, YouTube boasts over 2 billion monthly users and accounts for 12% of U.S. TV screen time ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ai-weakness-makes-youtube-alphabets-new-lynchpin-2025-04-23/#:~:text=emerging%20as%20a%20key%20asset,Although%20its%20cloud%20division%20has)), which no rival platform can currently match. 

Alphabet’s wide moat is evidenced by its **superior profitability and returns**. Even with heavy investment, it generated a 31.5% return on invested capital (TTM) – far above its ~9% cost of capital ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/GOOGL/WACC-Percentage/Alphabet%20Inc#:~:text=What%20is%20Alphabet%28Google%29%20WACC%20)). We expect Alphabet will maintain excess returns for at least the next two decades. While emerging AI chatbots and regulatory actions pose challenges, we agree with Morningstar that Google is likely to **“maintain its leadership position in search and text-based advertising in the long term.” ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/253438/alphabet-shares-fair-value-increased-%E2%80%93-despite-regulatory-pressure.aspx#:~:text=On%20the%20antitrust%20front%2C%20we,advertising%20in%20the%20long%20term))** In sum, Alphabet’s entrenched market position, technological leadership, and ecosystem lock-in confer a robust, sustainable moat.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our base-case fair value estimate is **$237 per share**, about 30% above the recent market price ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%3A%20We%20raise,capacity%20comes%20online%20in%202025)). This valuation is derived via a discounted cash flow model, assuming a **weighted average cost of capital around 9%** ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/GOOGL/WACC-Percentage/Alphabet%20Inc#:~:text=Switch%20to%3A)) and a terminal growth rate of ~4%. We project a **5-year revenue CAGR of ~10%**, driven by high-single-digit growth in Google’s ad businesses and ~25% annual growth in cloud and subscription revenues. By 2029, we forecast revenue approaching $600 billion. We see operating leverage improving as well – Alphabet’s operating margin rose from 26% in 2022 to 32% in 2024 amid cost efficiencies ([www.theglobeandmail.com](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/indices/XDB/pressreleases/27634575/alphabet-shows-lower-free-cash-flow-based-on-ai-spending-but-goog-stock-could-still-be-cheap/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20its%20operating%20income%20shot,as%20well)), and we model margins ticking up to the mid-30s (%) over the next five years. This is supported by an expected **reacceleration of Google Cloud’s sales** (back toward 30%+ growth once new capacity is added) and stabilization of YouTube and search ad margins. 

On the bottom line, share repurchases (roughly 2% of shares retired per year) amplify EPS growth versus revenue growth. We estimate EPS can expand at a mid-teens rate, from $8.13 in 2024 to around $17 by 2029. Our fair value assumes Alphabet’s free cash flow will grow in tandem – temporarily dipping in 2025 due to the capex surge, then expanding as growth capex normalizes. In our DCF, we **raised Alphabet’s fair value from $220 to $237** after Q4 2024 to reflect the firm’s stronger-than-expected top-line momentum and a **“reacceleration of Google Cloud sales as more capacity comes online in 2025.” ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/260354/alphabet-earnings-ai-strategy-remains-solid-raising-fair-value-estimate.aspx#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%3A%20We%20raise,capacity%20comes%20online%20in%202025))** At a $237 fair value, Alphabet would trade at roughly 28× 2024 earnings or ~22× our 2025 EPS estimate, a justified premium given its wide moat and double-digit growth prospects.

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Alphabet’s business faces a range of risks, earning a Medium uncertainty rating. **Macroeconomic downturns** pose a direct risk because advertising budgets are often cut in recessions. For instance, high inflation or a sustained consumer spending slowdown could curtail advertisers’ spending on Google, as seen when some major retail advertisers like Temu and Shein sharply reduced digital ad spend amid trade uncertainties ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Still%2C%20Google%27s%20chief%20business%20officer,at%20Google%20and%20Facebook%20parent)). **Competitive risk** has risen with advancements in AI – there is a scenario where conversational AI agents (from Microsoft, OpenAI, etc.) draw users away from traditional search, undermining Google’s ad revenue. While Google is countering with its own AI features, the outcome remains uncertain. **Regulatory and legal risks** are significant: Alphabet is contending with antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad that could lead to heavy fines or forced remedies (e.g. changes to default search agreements). U.S. regulators have even explored a breakup of Google’s businesses (Chrome, Android, etc.) to diminish its market dominance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-plan-break-up-googles-search-dominance-threatens-profit-engine-ai-growth-2024-10-09/#:~:text=2024,These%20proposals)), which would fundamentally alter Alphabet’s structure. Privacy regulations (such as GDPR) and potential bans on third-party cookies also threaten to disrupt Google’s targeted advertising model.

From an ESG perspective, **Social and Governance controversies** present uncertainty. Courts have already found Alphabet guilty of monopolistic practices in search and search advertising ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ai-weakness-makes-youtube-alphabets-new-lynchpin-2025-04-23/#:~:text=billion%2C%20with%20valuations%20placing%20it,8%20trillion)), damaging its reputation and inviting ongoing oversight. YouTube has faced criticism over content moderation (misinformation, harmful content), which could prompt stricter platform regulations or advertiser boycotts. Data privacy remains a material issue – any mishandling of user data or security breaches could result in significant penalties and user backlash. Operationally, Alphabet must manage the **risk of rapid technological change**. The firm’s heavy investments in moonshots may not pay off; for example, if Waymo or other projects fail to achieve commercial viability, Alphabet could incur substantial write-offs. Lastly, currency fluctuations and international regulatory differences add uncertainty to Alphabet’s large overseas earnings. Overall, while we see low risk of financial distress given Alphabet’s strong balance sheet, the **range of potential outcomes** – especially regarding AI disruption and regulatory intervention – keeps the uncertainty elevated to a medium-high level.

### Capital Allocation  
We rate Alphabet’s capital allocation as **Exemplary**, reflecting its robust balance sheet, prudent investments, and shareholder-friendly distributions. The company maintains one of the strongest financial positions in corporate America – at year-end 2024 it had over $115 billion in cash and marketable securities against only about $14 billion in debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=Long,4%2C694)). This net cash position provides flexibility to fund aggressive R&D and acquisitions. Management has demonstrated discipline in mergers & acquisitions, favoring smaller strategic tuck-ins (such as YouTube for $1.7 billion in 2006, and Nest Labs for $3 billion in 2014) rather than overpaying for large, splashy deals. Many of Alphabet’s bets (like YouTube and Android) have generated massive returns on relatively modest purchase prices. Where the company invests organically, it does so to **extend its moat** – for example, the hefty ~$25 billion annually poured into R&D has kept Google at the cutting edge of AI, search, and software. 

Alphabet’s stewardship of shareholder capital is also evident in its substantial cash returns. The company initiated its **first-ever dividend** in 2024 while continuing to prioritize buybacks ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-in-2-trillion-valuation-club-3401003#:~:text=%28Reuters%29%20,a%20%2470%20billion%20stock%20buyback)). In the last two years, Alphabet repurchased over $100 billion of its shares, shrinking its share count by roughly 5% and boosting per-share metrics. In April 2025, the board authorized another $70 billion repurchase program ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/google-says-deep-ai-investments-powering-ad-sales-soothing-anxious-investors/articleshow/120603801.cms#:~:text=Alphabet%20beat%20Q1%20profit%20and,continued%20growth%20and%20infrastructure%20expansion)), signaling confidence in the company’s undervaluation and future prospects. This buyback strategy is balanced against investment needs – notably, Alphabet is **escalating capital expenditures** (expected ~$85 billion in 2025) to expand data centers and AI infrastructure ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/alphabet-jumps-ai-driven-spending-fuels-cloud-revenue-surge-2025-07-24/#:~:text=Alphabet%20shares%20rose%20nearly%203,next%20year%20to%20support%20AI)). We view this as a rational allocation given the high returns on these investments and the existential importance of AI leadership. CEO Sundar Pichai has also shown willingness to enforce cost discipline, evidenced by the headcount reductions and slower expense growth in 2023–24 that helped lift margins. Overall, Alphabet’s management has earned top marks for balancing growth investments with returns: it consistently generates returns on capital well above its cost of capital, and its clear, shareholder-aligned capital deployment supports our **Exemplary** rating ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=218914#:~:text=Both%20Alphabet%20and%20Tesla%20earn,one%20ends%20on%20a%20tie)).

### ESG Risk  
Alphabet’s **ESG Risk Rating is “Medium”** with a score of about 25, placing it around the middle of both its industry and the global universe ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/alphabet-inc/1007907342#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Image)) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/alphabet-inc/1007907342#:~:text=Ranking)). According to Morningstar Sustainalytics, Alphabet ranks in the 68th percentile for risk within the Software & Services industry group (where 1st percentile is lowest risk) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/alphabet-inc/1007907342#:~:text=Ranking)). The company’s risk profile reflects **moderate exposure to material ESG issues** and mixed effectiveness in managing them. Key ESG challenges for Alphabet include **user privacy and data security** (handling vast amounts of personal data across Google’s platforms), **business ethics and antitrust** (its market dominance has led to monopoly allegations and trust deficits), and **content governance** on platforms like YouTube (preventing the spread of misinformation or harmful content). These issues have financial significance: for example, privacy lapses or antitrust violations can result in hefty fines or reputational damage.  

Alphabet’s **carbon footprint** is another consideration – running global data centers means high electricity usage, though the company has been a leader in renewable energy procurement and aims to be carbon-free by 2030. Governance-wise, Alphabet has a dual-class share structure that gives its founders outsized control, which some investors view as a governance risk (potentially insulating management from shareholder accountability). On a positive note, Alphabet scores well on certain ESG fronts: it has strong initiatives in data security (continuous investments in encryption and security teams) and has increased transparency around AI ethics and content policies in recent years. The **overall ESG risk rating of Medium ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/alphabet-inc/1007907342#:~:text=25))** suggests that while Alphabet faces noteworthy ESG risks – particularly around social and regulatory issues – these risks are being managed to a reasonable extent and are comparable to the average company’s risk. Continued improvement in areas like privacy safeguards, antitrust compliance, and content moderation will be important for Alphabet to possibly lower its ESG risk rating over time.

### Appendix  
**Key Valuation Assumptions:** Our DCF model assumes a **9.5% cost of equity** and ~9% WACC ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/GOOGL/WACC-Percentage/Alphabet%20Inc#:~:text=Switch%20to%3A)), reflecting Alphabet’s low financial leverage and our 5.5% equity risk premium. We use a **long-term terminal growth rate of 4%**, considering global GDP growth plus tech sector innovation. We project **2025–2029 revenue CAGR ~10%**, with Google Services revenue growing ~8% annually and Google Cloud ~25%+. Operating margin is forecast to expand to ~34–35% by 2029 as economies of scale in data centers and AI efficiency gains offset higher depreciation. We model annual **capital expenditures peaking at $85 billion in 2025** (21% of revenue) then moderating to ~15% of revenue by 2029, which supports ongoing growth investments without permanently depressing free cash flow. Our share count assumptions incorporate ~$50–70 billion of buybacks per year, reducing shares outstanding by ~2% annually. These inputs yield a **fair value of ~$237/share**, implying a 2025E P/E of ~25× and EV/EBITDA of ~16×, which we view as reasonable given Alphabet’s growth and competitive positioning.  

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- **Economic Moat:** A measure of sustainable competitive advantage. A **Wide moat** indicates we expect a company to fend off competitors and earn excess returns on capital for at least 20 years, thanks to factors like scale, network effects, or proprietary technology ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=218914#:~:text=The%20Morningstar%20Economic%20Moat%20Rating,has%20no%20moat%20at%20all)). A **Narrow moat** denotes advantages likely lasting 10+ years, and **No moat** means little protection from competition. Alphabet’s wide moat reflects its enduring dominance in core markets.  
- **Uncertainty Rating:** Reflects predictability of future cash flows. **Low uncertainty** firms have stable demand and low leverage, making their fair value estimates more dependable. **Medium** uncertainty (Alphabet’s category) indicates a moderate range of potential outcomes – solid core businesses but facing some volatility or disruption risk ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=218914#:~:text=uncertainty%3B%20those%20with%20less%20predictable,contingent%20events%20carry%20higher%20uncertainty)). **High or Very High** uncertainty applies when earnings are harder to forecast (cyclical markets, nascent industries, etc.), warranting a larger margin of safety in valuation.  
- **Capital Allocation Rating:** Assesses management’s use of capital (balance sheet management, investments, and shareholder returns). **Exemplary** means leadership is effectively growing value – maintaining a strong financial position, investing wisely in projects with high returns, and returning excess cash via dividends/buybacks prudently ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=218914#:~:text=The%C2%A0Morningstar%20Capital%20Allocation%20Rating%C2%A0represents%20our,sheet%2C%20investments%2C%20and%20shareholder%20distributions)). **Standard** indicates average performance, and **Poor** signals a history of value-destructive decisions (e.g. overpaying for acquisitions or taking on excessive debt). Alphabet’s exemplary rating reflects prudent reinvestment in its moat and substantial, well-timed buybacks.

**Disclaimer:** This analysis is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell any security.

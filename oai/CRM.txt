### Analyst Note
Salesforce delivered solid fiscal 2025 results, with full-year revenue of \$37.9 B, up ~9% YoY (9% in constant currency) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)), and record operating cash flow of \$13.1 B (+28% Y/Y) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%20billion%20in%20FY25)). Quarterly revenue growth remained in the mid-single-digits; Q4 FY25 came in at \$10.0 B (+8% Y/Y) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)). The company highlighted rapid adoption of its new AI and data services – notably \$900 M in Data Cloud & AI ARR (↑120% Y/Y) and 5,000 Agentforce deals (≈3,000 paid) since launch ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,trillion%20records%2C%20which%20doubled%20Y%2FY)) – underscoring management’s thesis that AI-driven automation will drive next-phase growth. EBITDA margins have expanded: non-GAAP operating margin hit 33.0% in FY25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)), reflecting cost discipline and prior restructuring. Salesforce returned \$9.3 B to shareholders via buybacks/dividends in FY25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%20billion%20in%20FY25)) while maintaining its acquisition posture (e.g. pending Informatica deal).  

Guidance for FY26 is cautious: management forecasts \$40.5–40.9 B (+7–8% YoY) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)) and \$11.09–11.17 EPS (non-GAAP), slightly below consensus ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)), citing expected headwinds in enterprise tech spending and the gradual tempo of AI rollouts. The stock rallied on FY25 cash flow and Agentforce deal wins ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/salesforce-closes-1000-paid-agentforce-deals-looks-robot-future-2024-12-17/#:~:text=Salesforce%20has%20finalized%20over%201%2C000,as%20recruiting%20and%20customer%20service)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-jumps-latest-ai-tools-set-accelerate-demand-2024-12-04/#:~:text=quarterly%20sales%20estimates%20and%20announced,launch%2C%20Agentforce%20already%20secured%20200)), but then dipped as FY26 sales guidance fell short of Wall Street forecasts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)). We see Salesforce’s medium-term outlook as balanced: innovation around Customer 360/AI can sustain a ~7–8% revenue CAGR, but intensifying competition and macro uncertainty temper upside. Key thesis: Salesforce retains market leadership in CRM (21.7% share per IDC ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/idc-crm-market-share-ranking-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L16%20Details%3A%20In,CRM%20vendor%2C%20according%20to%20IDC))) and a strong recurring revenue base, while doubling down on AI/data. Our fair-value model (WACC ~9%, 2.5% terminal growth) yields a share price around \$300, implying ~7.5× FY26 EV/Sales and ~27× P/E ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)). At current levels (~\$270), the stock trades near intrinsic value, balancing growth potential against execution risk.

### Business Description  
Salesforce (CRM) is a leading provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise software solutions. Its platform – branded Customer 360 – includes Sales Cloud (sales automation), Service Cloud (customer support), Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Analytics (Tableau) and integration tools (MuleSoft), as well as collaboration (Slack) and industry-specific modules. Most revenue (>90%) is subscription and support fees for its SaaS offerings. The company targets businesses of all sizes globally, with a strong presence in North America and Europe. Salesforce serves tens of thousands of organizations, including roughly half of the Fortune 100 as users of its AI and Data Cloud services ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,of%20the%20requests%20requiring%20human)). Large enterprises (e.g. GM, AT&T, Toyota, Bank of America) are major customers, along with a broad base of mid-market clients. Recent strategic acquisitions (Tableau in 2019, Slack in 2021 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Salesforce%20announced%20plans%20to%20acquire,The%20acquisition))) have expanded Salesforce’s portfolio into analytics and team collaboration, while partnerships (e.g. AWS Hyperforce) extend its geographic reach.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Salesforce’s strategy centers on up-selling its multi-cloud platform and innovating with AI-driven features. Management emphasizes an integrated ecosystem (“Customer 360”) where data is shared across sales, service, marketing, commerce and analytics functions. The company has invested heavily in AI (Einstein and new Agentforce) and data management (Data Cloud), with the goal of embedding intelligent automation into workflows. For example, over 3,000 customers have paid for the new Agentforce AI-agent platform ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,trillion%20records%2C%20which%20doubled%20Y%2FY)), and Data Cloud usage (which has surpassed 50 trillion records) tripled year-over-year ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,trillion%20records%2C%20which%20doubled%20Y%2FY)). These enhancements aim to raise customer stickiness and drive higher spend per account.  

Longer-term, secular trends favor Salesforce: digital transformation and AI adoption are accelerating in enterprise software. Many customers are looking to replace legacy on-premise CRM with cloud services. Salesforce’s broad portfolio and PaaS (platform-as-a-service) model allows cross-selling and customization, reinforcing its role as an IT backbone. However, competition is intense (Microsoft Dynamics 365, Oracle NetSuite, Adobe Marketo, etc.), so maintaining product leadership and execution is critical. We anticipate mid-term growth of ~7–8% CAGR (FY24–29) as AI and data platformening drives higher sales per customer, supported by industry growth and expanding international markets.  

### Bulls Say  
1. **Market leader with strong momentum:** Salesforce is #1 in global CRM market share (~21.7% in 2023 ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/idc-crm-market-share-ranking-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L16%20Details%3A%20In,CRM%20vendor%2C%20according%20to%20IDC))) and has consistently beaten revenue forecasts. The company’s large installed base provides upsell opportunities as customers adopt AI/Data modules. Its total remaining performance obligation (RPO) was \$63.4 B (+11% YoY) entering FY26 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)), indicating a solid multi-year revenue runway.  
2. **Accelerating AI and Data offerings:** The new Agentforce and Data Cloud products are gaining traction. Management reports ~1,000 paying Agentforce contracts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/salesforce-closes-1000-paid-agentforce-deals-looks-robot-future-2024-12-17/#:~:text=Salesforce%20has%20finalized%20over%201%2C000,as%20recruiting%20and%20customer%20service)) and clients like major hotel chains using AI agents for tasks. Data Cloud ARR grew 120% YoY to \$900 M ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,trillion%20records%2C%20which%20doubled%20Y%2FY)). Analysts view AI as a substantial growth catalyst, potentially driving adoption beyond routine CRM (with benefits like productivity gains and cost savings) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-jumps-latest-ai-tools-set-accelerate-demand-2024-12-04/#:~:text=quarterly%20sales%20estimates%20and%20announced,launch%2C%20Agentforce%20already%20secured%20200)).  
3. **Healthy finances and returns:** Salesforce is generating massive cash flows (FY25 free cash flow \$12.4 B ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%20billion%20in%20FY25))) and has no net debt. It has returned \$21 B to shareholders since initiating buybacks ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20closed%20out%20the%20year,%E2%80%9D)). Rising non-GAAP operating margin (33.0% in FY25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY))) underpins strong FCF yields. The firm maintained its capital return program (recent guidance indicated buybacks fully offset share-based compensation dilution ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/fy25-q2-earnings/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20continue%20to%20deliver%20disciplined,%E2%80%9D))).  
4. **Strategic deals expanding reach:** Recent M&A and partnerships enhance capabilities. Planned acquisitions of data-security (“Own Company”) and data-management (Informatica) platforms address customer needs and bolster the AI/data strategy ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/salesforce-buy-data-protection-provider-own-company-19-bln-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Salesforce%20announced%20its%20plan%20to,500%20million%20in%20funding%20from)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=aims%20to%20bolster%20Salesforce%E2%80%99s%20capabilities,Salesforce%20has)). These moves (after a pause during activist concern) show management’s focus on growth opportunities that complement core CRM.  

### Bears Say  
1. **Slowing growth and AI execution risk:** Salesforce’s revenue growth has decelerated to ~8% (Q2 and Q4 FY25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-third-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2024-08-28/#:~:text=The%20firm%27s%20growth%20slowed%20to,beating%20analyst%20expectations)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)). Bearish investors note enterprises have not yet “busted out” SAP/Oracle spending as hoped, keeping new sales moderately paced. The company itself guided FY26 revenue below Street expectations ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)), blaming slower-than-anticipated Agentforce uptake and cautious IT budgets. If enterprises balk at AI platform projects or delay renewals, growth may disappoint.  
2. **Competitive and macro pressures:** The CRM market is contested by large incumbents. Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others aggressively target Salesforce’s opportunity. Salesforce’s advantage can be vulnerable to pricing pressure or feature competition. Coupled with global economic uncertainties, rising rates and IT spending moderation, demand could falter. For example, recent cuts (700 jobs, 1% workforce) were cited as early cost responses ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2024-02-28/#:~:text=tech%20spending%20due%20to%20clients,cautious%20economic%20outlook%20also%20affects)). Near-term forecasts factor in a slow recovery in tech spend.  
3. **Integration and governance risks:** Large acquisitions (Usingo $1.9B, Informatica $8B) and product rollouts carry execution risks. The Informatica deal (pending ~5/2025) may attract antitrust scrutiny due to overlap with MuleSoft ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=reportedly%20closed%20over%201%2C000%20paid,Salesforce%E2%80%99s)). Any delays or regulatory hurdles could unsettle investors. Salesforce also faces internal shifts: longtime CFO Amy Weaver announced her departure after FY25 ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/fy25-q2-earnings/#:~:text=Amy%20Weaver%20has%20made%20the,an%20advisor%20to%20the%20company)), raising uncertainty around financial stewardship. Activist investor pressure (Elliott) previously curtailed dealmaking ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/salesforce-buy-data-protection-provider-own-company-19-bln-2024-09-05/#:~:text=with%20ServiceNow%20and%20Microsoft%20Dynamics,acquisitions%20to%20boost%20revenue%20growth)), suggesting strategic priorities might swing with ownership changes.  
4. **Valuation concerns:** Even after recent share dips, CRM peers trade at high multiples. Salesforce’s forward P/E (~24x at current price and FY26 EPS) and EV/Revenue (~7x on FY26 sales) leave limited margin for error. If any expected revenue acceleration stalls, the stock could lag (as happened after the FY26 guide miss ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Salesforce%20forecasted%20its%20fiscal%202026,Full))).  

### Economic Moat  
Salesforce’s moat stems from network effects and switching costs in enterprise software. The company’s broad ecosystem (Customer 360 with integrated apps and data) and recurring revenue model create customer lock-in. IDC data show Salesforce is #1 CRM by revenue ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/idc-crm-market-share-ranking-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L16%20Details%3A%20In,CRM%20vendor%2C%20according%20to%20IDC)), reflecting brand and product leadership. Additionally, high switching costs in CRM (data migration, retraining, reconfiguration) protect incumbency. Its platform (Force.com, MuleSoft, Slack) fosters a large developer and partner network, raising competitive barriers. However, competition is intense and products are partly substitutable (e.g. Microsoft Dynamics), so we classify Salesforce’s economic moat as **Narrow**: its advantages are real but not unassailable. Salesforce still must continuously innovate to maintain its edge.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our valuation uses a discounted cash flow model: we assume FY26–29 revenue growth of ~7–8% annually (reflecting management guidance and modest acceleration from AI). We project non-GAAP operating margins rising to ~34–35% by FY26–29 (up from 33.0% in FY25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY))) due to scale and efficiency gains. We assume a 9.0% WACC (implied beta ~1.1, ERP ~5%) and a 2.5% terminal growth rate. Using these inputs yields a fair enterprise value ~\$300 B, implying an equity value ~$300/share. At this fair price, implied multiples are roughly 7.8× FY26 EV/Sales and ~27× FY26 P/E (non-GAAP EPS ~\$11.13) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=deter%20new%20investments,The%20firm%27s%20future%20growth)).  

Key profit drivers: recurring subscription revenue (~94% of sales) ensures visibility; we assume a gradual rebound in CRM spending and further upsell of new offerings. We forecast FY26–29 EPS rising from ~\$9 (FY25) to over \$15 by FY29 as margins improve and share count modestly declines. Free cash flow conversion remains high (we model ~30–32% of revenue), supporting ongoing share repurchases. Sensitivity: a 1% error in revenue growth or margin assumption alters value by mid-single digit percentage. Toys: The largest assumptions in our model are sustained mid-single-digit organic growth and the successful monetization of AI investments.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Salesforce faces several risks: **Macro and demand**: Slower global economic growth or enterprise IT spending cuts can directly reduce new license sales or renewals. Enterprise budgeting cycles remained cautious in FY25 (guidance miss ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Salesforce%20forecasted%20its%20fiscal%202026,Full))). Prolonged downturn could extend the recovery timeline. **Competitive**: Large tech competitors (Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, SAP) all invest heavily in CRM/ERP offerings. If rivals offer bundled solutions or aggressive pricing, Salesforce might lose deals or market share. **Innovation execution**: The company’s AI initiatives are critical; lower-than-expected adoption of Agentforce (or data products) can materially hurt growth. Technical glitches or security issues in cloud services would also erode trust. **Regulatory/Legal**: Large M&A deals (e.g. Informatica) may face antitrust scrutiny ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=reportedly%20closed%20over%201%2C000%20paid,Salesforce%E2%80%99s)). Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and cyber risks in cloud software are material governance issues. **Leadership and governance**: The announced departure of CFO Amy Weaver ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/fy25-q2-earnings/#:~:text=Amy%20Weaver%20has%20made%20the,an%20advisor%20to%20the%20company)) (after FY25) introduces transitional risk. Shareholder activism may re-emerge if performance lags (activists had previously pressured to curb acquisitions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/salesforce-buy-data-protection-provider-own-company-19-bln-2024-09-05/#:~:text=with%20ServiceNow%20and%20Microsoft%20Dynamics,acquisitions%20to%20boost%20revenue%20growth))). **ESG Factors**: Uncontrolled tech-ethics issues or novel ESG controversies (e.g. AI biases) could pose reputational/financial risk, though currently Salesforce has a strong ESG stance.  

### Capital Allocation  
Salesforce maintains a strong balance sheet (net cash position; no material debt). It generates robust free cash flow (\$12.4 B in FY25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%20billion%20in%20FY25))) and has a history of returning excess capital. Since initiating buybacks, it has repurchased \$21 B of stock ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20closed%20out%20the%20year,%E2%80%9D)) and recently added a modest quarterly dividend. Management targets offsetting stock-based compensation dilution (CFO expects to “more than fully offset” SBP dilution) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/fy25-q2-earnings/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20continue%20to%20deliver%20disciplined,%E2%80%9D)). M&A spending is disciplined: despite earlier activist pressure to pause deals, Salesforce last year resumed targeted acquisitions (at valuations near book value or less) that align with its AI/data strategy. We view the allocation of capital as **Strong**: the company balances growth investments with shareholder returns and maintains financial flexibility.

### ESG Risk  
Salesforce generally scores well on ESG metrics relative to software peers. Environmentally, it has achieved 100% renewable energy and net-zero residual emissions across its global operations (Scope 1–3) as of 2021 ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2021/09/21/salesforce-achieves-net-zero-across-its-full-value-chain/#:~:text=Salesforce%20achieves%20net%20zero%20residual,renewable%20energy)), mitigating climate transition risk. Socially, the company emphasizes inclusive culture and data ethics, though as a data-centric firm it must manage customer privacy and security. Governance is strong (no shareholder rights issues, and Benioff/Board aligned on mission). In Sustainalytics’ framework, Salesforce would likely fall in the “Medium” risk category (its principal ESG risk areas are data privacy/security and ethics, matching industry norms). Material ESG issues include data protection (given its CRM role), workforce diversity/wellbeing, and supply-chain sustainability. Overall, Salesforce’s proactive environmental initiatives and sound governance reduce its ESG risk profile relative to industrial peers.

### Appendix  
**Valuation Assumptions:** WACC ~9.0% (RF ~4.0%, ERP ~5.0%, beta ~1.1), tax rate ~25%. Terminal growth ~2.5%. Shares outstanding ~1.0B. FY26–29 revenue growth ~7–8%/year; non-GAAP EBIT margins rising to ~35%. FCF conversion ~30%.

Salesforce’s moat is **Narrow** (leadership in CRM but significant competition) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/idc-crm-market-share-ranking-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L16%20Details%3A%20In,CRM%20vendor%2C%20according%20to%20IDC)). *Uncertainty* reflects predictability of future results (Low/Medium/High); Salesforce faces Medium uncertainty given macro and tech volatility. *Capital Allocation Rating* grades how effectively management deploys capital (Morningstar-style A–D); we assess Salesforce’s allocation as Strong (ample buybacks and disciplined growth investments) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3%20billion%20in%20FY25)).

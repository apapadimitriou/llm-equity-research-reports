### Analyst Note  
ServiceNow reported strong Q2 2025 results (ending June 30) on July 23, beating guidance and raising its outlook ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=high%20end%20of%20our%20guidance,for%20the%20second%20half%20of)). Subscription revenue was $3,113M (22.5% YoY growth) and total revenues $3,215M, each +21–22% in constant currency ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030)). Management noted robust deal volume, especially Now Assist AI, and hit the high end of guidance across all metrics ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CQ2%20was%20a%20spectacular%20quarter,for%20the%20second%20half%20of)). The stock jumped on the news, continuing a recent theme of market optimism for AI-driven cloud workflows ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-futures-mixed-investors-weigh-alphabet-tesla-earnings-2025-07-24/#:~:text=day.%20Meanwhile%2C%20IBM%20dropped%205.25,raising%20its%20subscription%20revenue%20outlook)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CServiceNow%E2%80%99s%20outstanding%20second%20quarter%20results,%E2%80%9D)). We now model a multi-year growth slowdown from recent 20%-plus revenue growth toward mid-teens. We forecast FY2025 revenue ≈$13.0B (up ~18% YoY) and gradually decelerating to ~10% by 2029. Gross margins remain high (~80%) and non-GAAP operating margin is near 30%; we assume operating margins stabilize around that level. Free cash flow has averaged ~30% of revenue and should remain robust (projected ~$3.9B in 2025, rising through ~$6.3B by 2029). At a forecast WACC ~8.5% and terminal growth ~3%, our DCF yields a fair value near $370 per share (implying ~2.6× premium to current price). Upside hinge on continued enterprise AI adoption and successful integrations (Moveworks, data.world). Key risks include prolonged IT spending cycles, competition (e.g. AWS, Microsoft in enterprise workflows), and valuation pressure from high multiples.  

### Business Description  
ServiceNow is a cloud software company providing AI-powered workflow automation and digital solutions. Founded mid-2000s, it pioneered SaaS IT service management (“ITSM”) and has expanded into IT operations, HR service, customer service, security operations, and other workflow domains ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20followed%20the%20successful,service%20management%2C%20and%20security%20verticals)). Its flagship Now Platform integrates processes and data across an enterprise, enabling tickets, inventory, governance, and AI agents in one system. Major offerings include IT Service Management, HR Service Delivery, Security Operations, Customer Service Management, and new “Plus” AI-enhanced product suites. ServiceNow’s business is mostly subscription-based (96–97% of revenue) with modest professional services. It serves enterprises worldwide, with ~10,000 customers (as of 2024) and hundreds of thousands of users on its platform.

Geographically, revenue is primarily North America (over half) followed by EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Key customer segments include large corporations and government entities; 2024’s customer base included 2,100 customers with >$1M annual contract value (ACV) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20December%2031%2C%202024%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)). The company targets digital transformation use cases across verticals (financial services, healthcare, telecom, manufacturing etc.) with an emphasis on enabling AI and automation in legacy processes. Recent expansion includes launching ServiceNow on AWS Marketplace and deeper partnerships (Google Cloud, NVIDIA, EY, Cisco, etc.) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,an%20integration%20between%20UKG%27s%20AI)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/workflow-data-fabric-ai-agents.html#:~:text=ServiceNow%20closed%20on%20the%20acquisition,the%20deal%20were%20not%20disclosed)). 

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
ServiceNow’s strategy centers on positioning its unified AI-driven platform as indispensable. The company emphasizes the breadth of its workflow integrations – linking IT, HR, customer support, and security – to raise switching costs. By adding generative-AI features (Now Assist) and enterprise data services (Workflow Data Network, Data World integration ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=scale%20AI%20agents%20across%20functions%2C,increase%20productivity%20and%20strengthen%20loyalty)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/workflow-data-fabric-ai-agents.html#:~:text=ServiceNow%20closed%20on%20the%20acquisition,the%20deal%20were%20not%20disclosed))), ServiceNow aims to expand use beyond IT and into strategic functions like finance, legal, and supply chain. Management is balancing R&D (AI innovation) with execution: for example, Now Assist accounted for a record net-new ACV in early 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=,grow%20its%20AI%E2%80%91related%20partnerships%E2%80%94including%20a)). At Q2’25, ServiceNow reported 528 customers with >$5M ACV (up ~19.5% YoY) and 89 new deals over $1M ACV ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20June%2030%2C%202025%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)), indicating success in upselling large accounts.

Longer term, ServiceNow targets continued cross-sell and expansion of the “end-to-end workflow” market. Management believes total addressable market extends beyond core ITSM (4,400 customers still only partially penetrated) to all enterprise work (weaker competitors exist) ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=service%20management%2C%20management%20has%20said,multiples%20above%20the%20core%20product)). The company’s revenue growth has been accelerating thanks to AI adoption: Q4’23 growth was ~27% with CEO McDermott calling it a “breakthrough moment” as generative AI “fuels a top-to-bottom reordering” ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CServiceNow%20closed%20out%20the%20year,%E2%80%9D)). At Q2’25, growth remained strong (22.5% in subscriptions ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030))). We expect mid-teens growth for 2025–2026, gradually normalizing as the base gets larger. With high retention (~97-99% of subscription customers ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=Our%20overall%20thesis%20for%20our,99%25%20retention%20every))) and strong financial execution (consistently beating guidance), we view the business outlook as favorable but potentially tempered by macro IT spend cycles. The move to use AI internally (slashing $100M in 2025 hires ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/24/artificial-intelligence-servicenow-hiring#:~:text=ServiceNow%2C%20a%20leading%20automation%20software,exceeded%20expectations%2C%20and%20projections%20remain))) suggests efficiency gains that could boost margins further, though the main focus is demand-driven growth.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls Say:**  
1. **AI Differentiation and Upside:** ServiceNow is becoming the enterprise “agentic OS” of the AI era ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CServiceNow%E2%80%99s%20outstanding%20second%20quarter%20results,%E2%80%9D)). Its AI Control Tower, Agent Fabric, and now-embedded AI agents insert the platform deep into workflows, creating stickiness. Strong demand is evident: the Q2 beat-and-raise demonstrated continued robust demand (subscription growth +22.5% YoY ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030))) and management has raised full-year guidance. Roaring adoption (e.g. doubling Knowledge conference attendance and launching hundreds of AI features ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,ecosystem%20to%20unify%20data%2C%20improve))) indicates a virtuous cycle of innovation and sales. The large deal funnel (Net-new ACV streak on track for $1B target ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CQ2%20was%20a%20spectacular%20quarter,for%20the%20second%20half%20of))) and high enterprise retention (episodes of $20M+ deals up 30% YoY ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year))) suggest strong future revenue. Recent strategic moves – e.g. acquiring AI assistant vendor Moveworks ($2.85B deal) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/10/servicenow-moveworks-acquisition#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20announced%20that%20it,300%20million%20in%20venture%20capital)) and data.world – bolster product capabilities in high-growth segments. Analysts like Morningstar have upgraded ServiceNow to a Wide Moat on these durable competitive advantages ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=Our%20overall%20thesis%20for%20our,99%25%20retention%20every)).  

2. **Robust Financial Profile:** ServiceNow’s cloud model yields high gross and operating margins (~80% and ~30% respectively in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,31.5))), with accelerating free cash flows (FCF up ~30% YoY in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,31.5))). The balance sheet is healthy (net cash), enabling disciplined share buybacks (nearly $0.4B repurchased in Q4’23 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=,repurchases%20under%20the%20existing%20program))) and funding for strategic M&A. ESG metrics are strong (Sustainalytics score 16.3, “Low Risk” ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/servicenow-inc/1030845733#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Image))), reflecting resilient business practices. Given the resilient execution (successfully “beat the high end of guidance” in recent quarters ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CQ2%20was%20a%20spectacular%20quarter,for%20the%20second%20half%20of))) and strong tailwinds, bulls see continued upside and justify current valuation multiples.  

**Bears Say:**  
1. **Valuation and Macro Risk:** ServiceNow’s stock trades at a very high multiple (forward P/E ~48× ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?e=2025-03-21&t=NOW#:~:text=Market%20Cap%20195,15.98)) and P/S ~17×), pricing in near-perfect execution and sustained high growth. Any slowdown in enterprise IT spending or disillusionment with AI hype could pressure the stock sharply. History cautions that corporate IT budgets can reallocate (ServiceNow warned of slower Q2 2024 growth amid caution ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/servicenow-profit-more-than-doubles-boost-ai-enabled-software-2024-04-24/#:~:text=2024,anticipates%20subscription%20revenue%20to%20be))). Slower customer spending or tougher economic conditions could flatten growth. Furthermore, planned hires cut via AI cost-saving ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/24/artificial-intelligence-servicenow-hiring#:~:text=ServiceNow%2C%20a%20leading%20automation%20software,exceeded%20expectations%2C%20and%20projections%20remain)) hint that even ServiceNow expects some near-term pressure.  

2. **Competitive and Execution Challenges:** Large tech rivals (Microsoft’s Power Platform, Google Cloud workflows, AWS’s AI initiatives) could encroach on ServiceNow’s market, especially as integration of open AI models lowers barriers for traditional software.
The company’s strategy relies on hitting ambitious targets (e.g. $1B net-new AI ACV by 2026). While Moveworks and data.world acquisitions expand AI capabilities, they come with execution risk and no immediate revenue. Failure to integrate these smoothly or fully realize AI synergies could disappoint. There is also execution risk in expanding beyond ServiceNow’s IT heritage: penetrating HR, finance, and customer workflows is non-trivial. Any hiccups (e.g. churn of big customers, or inability to upsell faster) could come to light if future growth slows. Bears also worry that insider selling or missed guidance could dampen sentiment in a fragile market.  

### Economic Moat  
ServiceNow’s moat is rooted in **switching costs and ecosystem lock-in**. Enterprises invest heavily to integrate ServiceNow’s workflow engine; once critical processes (ITSM, security, HR, etc.) run on its platform, migrating away would be disruptive. ServiceNow has an “industry-leading customer retention” (97–99% renewals ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=Our%20overall%20thesis%20for%20our,99%25%20retention%20every))) which reflects these costs and the LTV/CAC ratio. Its broad product suite (from core IT service management into adjacent areas and AI agents ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20followed%20the%20successful,service%20management%2C%20and%20security%20verticals)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,ecosystem%20to%20unify%20data%2C%20improve))) creates cross-selling opportunities: an existing ITSM customer can more easily adopt ServiceNow’s security or HR modules, raising its total wallet. This has enabled rapid growth beyond IT; for example, 2024 saw nearly 500 customers spending >$5M ACV (up 21% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20December%2031%2C%202024%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)).  

We agree Morningstar’s view: ServiceNow enjoys a **Wide moat** due to high retention and ecosystem depth ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/nows-time-servicenow#:~:text=Our%20overall%20thesis%20for%20our,99%25%20retention%20every)). Even new entrants find it hard to supplant an integrated platform that spans an enterprise’s entire workflow stack. In our view, ServiceNow’s governance tools for AI (Control Tower) and specialized agents (e.g. for security/risk) further entrench its role. However, the moat is not impregnable: it relies on staying ahead in innovation. Sustained leadership in AI-enhanced workflows is necessary to maintain these advantages. So far, ServiceNow’s execution (consistent outperformance of guidance) supports the wide-moat thesis, but competition in AI integration remains a long-term watch.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our DCF-based fair-value estimate is ~$370 per share (calendar 2025). Key model inputs:  
- **Revenue CAGR:** We project ~18% growth in FY2025 (to ~$13.0B) and a gradual deceleration to high-single digits by FY2029 (ending ~$21B). This is driven by continued adoption of AI-driven workflows in enterprise customers, robust large-deal momentum, and expansion into new workflow categories (CRM, HR etc.). The compound revenue CAGR 2024–29 is ~12–13%.  
- **Margins:** We assume non-GAAP operating margin stabilizes ~30% (near 29.5% in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,31.5))) as growth moderates. Gross margin remains high (~80%) given SaaS efficiency.  
- **Tax and FCF:** We assume a tax rate ~20%. Free cash flow has trended ~30% of revenue (FY2024 was $3.46B on $10.98B rev, ~31.5% ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,31.5))). We forecast FCF rising from ~$3.9B in 2025 to ~$6.3B by 2029 (nearly 30% of revenues each year).  
- **Cost of Capital:** We use a WACC ~8.5%, reflecting ServiceNow’s growth profile and low cost of debt. Our terminal-growth rate is 3%.  

These assumptions yield a net present value consistent with ~$370 per share. That implies ~2.6× current price (2.2× EV/sales and ~17× 2026 EPS in our model). Implied multiples of enterprise value to 2026 sales are ~8–9×. At ~30% FCF margin, this equates to ~30× on 2026 FCF – reflecting a premium growth stock multiple.

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Macro uncertainty: Enterprise IT spending can be cyclical. A broader downturn, tighter budgets or slower hiring (especially in tech) could delay purchases or renewals, hurting growth. Currency swings can also affect reported growth, although ServiceNow hedges partially. Inflationary pressure on wages and costs is mitigated by automation savings (e.g. $100M staff cost cut ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/24/artificial-intelligence-servicenow-hiring#:~:text=ServiceNow%2C%20a%20leading%20automation%20software,exceeded%20expectations%2C%20and%20projections%20remain))), but multi-year salary raises could compress margins if revenue slows. Geopolitical factors (e.g. trade disputes) pose risk; government customers account for a meaningful chunk of contracts (ServiceNow’s federal business has seen a higher mix of short-term deals, complicating RPO conversion ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=cRPO%20guidance%20reflects%20the%20continued,and%20self%E2%80%91hosted%20deals%2C%20both%20of))).  

Regulatory: As a global software provider, ServiceNow faces data-privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) and cybersecurity regulations. Taxes (especially potential global tech taxes) and changes in IP law could impact effective rates or litigation risk. So far, no major legal issues are public, but any GDPR violations on its platform would be reputationally costly.  

Competition & Platform Risk: Rival platforms (ServiceNow competitors or customers developing in-house solutions) could erode growth. The rapidly evolving AI landscape means ServiceNow must continuously invest to keep its AI fabric competitive; execution missteps here could hamper adoption. Also, as ServiceNow expands (e.g. CRM, FinOps), it enters markets with entrenched incumbents (Salesforce, Oracle Netsuite, etc.), increasing execution risk. Integration risk from acquisitions (Moveworks, data.world) is modest given management’s track record, but unclear synergies could pose short-term dilution or tech clutter.  

Valuation Uncertainty: The stock’s high valuation implies significant execution. Any disappointment (missed guidance, slower bookings) would likely trigger a sharp re-rating. Given ~90% institutional ownership ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?e=2025-03-21&t=NOW#:~:text=Float%20206.11M%20Perf%20Month%2012.73,Short%20Float%20%20%203)), flows and sentiment swings could exaggerate moves. We assess medium uncertainty: fundamentals are clear, but high expectations amplify risk.

### Capital Allocation  
ServiceNow has no dividend but returns cash via share repurchases. It maintains a strong balance sheet (net cash positive), enabling disciplined buybacks and small M&A. The Board just authorized an additional $3B buyback (on top of prior program) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)). In Q4 2023 it repurchased ~$0.26B (400k shares) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-financial-results.html#:~:text=,repurchases%20under%20the%20existing%20program)), demonstrating commitment to offset dilution. M&A has been strategic: the Moveworks deal ($2.85B all-in) was the largest yet ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/10/servicenow-moveworks-acquisition#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20announced%20that%20it,300%20million%20in%20venture%20capital)), signaling readiness to pay for AI capabilities, but the company remains prudent in deal valuation (no other huge deals announced). We rate capital allocation **Standard**: the firm judiciously returns excess cash and invests in business-building acquisitions, without aggressive leverage.

### ESG Risk  
ServiceNow’s Sustainalytics ESG Risk Score is 16.3 (“Low” risk) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/servicenow-inc/1030845733#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Image)). This reflects modest exposure to carbon emissions (fully cloud-based services), a strong supply-chain/supplier code program, and generally strong governance practices.

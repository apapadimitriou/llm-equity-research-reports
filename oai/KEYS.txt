### Analyst Note  
Keysight’s Q1 FY2025 results (ending Jan 31, 2025) showed a return to growth after a flat prior year: revenue was $1.30 B, up 3% year-on-year ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024)), while orders rose 4% to $1.263 B ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Satish%2C%20and%20hello%2C,3%20billion)). Non-GAAP EPS was $1.82, above guidance, and free cash flow was $346 M (up 23% YOY) ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=%2A%20Non,281%20million%20in%20the%20first)). The Communications Solutions Group led growth (+5% YOY) driven by commercial telecom and aerospace/defense demand ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=CSG%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%24883,in%20aerospace%2C%20defense%2C%20and%20government)); Electronic Industrial Group was roughly flat ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,EISG)). Management reiterated a “gradual recovery” view in 2025 ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=%2A%20Second%2C%20orders%20grew%20year,S)). Underlying tailwinds include AI-driven data center networking and 5G/6G investment (Keysight cites “record orders” in AI and advanced communications test equipment ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=and%20solutions%20at%20the%20physical%2C,create%20value%20for%20our%20stakeholders)) ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=At%20DesignCon%2C%20Keysight%20demonstrated%20an,data%20center%20and%20communications%20ecosystem))).  

Despite the beat, near-term headwinds persist. Recent guidance (Q2 FY2025: $1.27–1.29 B revenue; EPS $1.61–1.67 ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Keysight%27s%20second%20fiscal%20quarter%20of,million%20shares%20and%20a%20non))) reflects only modest growth and warns of continued softness in telecom and semiconductor spending. Analysts note customers are delaying purchases (“pushing out” orders) due to macro weakness ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports?listing=0P00014HI6#:~:text=We%20trim%20our%20fair%20value,drop%20in%20after)). We view Keysight’s growth cycle as bottoming; the company’s broad portfolio and strong customer relationships support stable mid-term outlook, but near-term results hinge on end-market recovery. At ~$162, shares trade near our fair-value estimate ($170), implying about 20–22× forward EPS. Given uncertainty in demand and regulatory factors, Keysight appears fairly valued absent a clearer recovery. Key positives include its improving revenues and backlog ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Satish%2C%20and%20hello%2C,3%20billion)); negatives include subdued capex and potential pressure on margins in a weak cyclical environment ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/keysight-forecast-third-quarter-profit-below-estimates-slow-demand-2024-05-20/#:~:text=Keysight%20Technologies%20forecasted%20a%20third,due%20to%20constraints%20in%20semiconductor)). Our thesis remains that Keysight’s strong technology position underpins long-term growth, offset by medium-term uncertainty.  

### Business Description  
Keysight Technologies is a Santa Rosa, CA-based electronics test and measurement company. It offers hardware and software solutions that help engineers design, test, and optimize electronic systems in communications, industrial, aerospace/defense, automotive, semiconductor, and general electronics markets ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=Keysight%E2%80%99s%20history%20of%20collaborative%20innovation,quickly%2C%20to%20enable%20customer%20success)). Key products include oscilloscopes, network analyzers, signal generators, and design/validation software. The company reports through two segments ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,related%20customer%20spending)) ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=)): (1) *Communications Solutions Group (CSG)* – test equipment for commercial communications networks and aerospace/defense (wireline and wireless); and (2) *Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG)* – test and measurement for semiconductor device fabrication, automotive/energy electronics, and industrial IoT. In Q1 2025, CSG revenue was $883 M (+5% YOY) and EISG was $415 M (–1%) ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=CSG%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%24883,in%20aerospace%2C%20defense%2C%20and%20government)). Keysight sells globally, with major markets in North America, Asia, and Europe, and maintains a direct sales organization worldwide. Major customers include network equipment manufacturers, semiconductor fabs, defense agencies, and OEMs.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Keysight’s strategy emphasizes innovation, broad product scope, and recurring revenue. It invests heavily in R&D (16% of sales in FY2024 ) to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies. The firm highlights its long-standing customer partnerships and in-house expertise to deliver first-to-market solutions (e.g. latest 400G/400ZR network test gear and 6G research tools ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=At%20DesignCon%2C%20Keysight%20demonstrated%20an,data%20center%20and%20communications%20ecosystem))). Keysight has also expanded software and services – now ~40% of revenue – and growing recurring licensing (~31% of sales ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=We%20have%20made%20strategic%20progress,as%20well%20as%20industrial%20customers))), which should build customer stickiness and margin stability over time.  

Market trends underpinning Keysight’s outlook include robust 5G/6G infrastructure spending, growth in AI data centers (which require high-speed interconnect and memory testing), and ongoing defense modernization. Management expects gradual improvement in orders as these secular drivers offset cyclical dips ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=%2A%20Second%2C%20orders%20grew%20year,S)). In the medium term (next 3–5 years), we forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as semiconductor and communications spending normalize and Spirent Communications (pending acquisition) adds new test markets. Assuming moderate demand lumber, Keysight’s diversified portfolio and product leadership should allow outperformance once industry capex turns up. However, recovery could be uneven: we note near-term reluctance in telecom and consumer electronics customers. Overall, we project modest growth and steady margins over 2025–29, with upside from market share gains if network/AI trends accelerate.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls:**  
1. *Technology leadership:* Keysight holds market-leading test capabilities (e.g. industry’s fastest 400G-per-lane data link testers) that align with next-generation network and AI trends ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=At%20DesignCon%2C%20Keysight%20demonstrated%20an,data%20center%20and%20communications%20ecosystem)).  
2. *Secular tailwinds:* Long-term growth drivers (5G/6G rollout, AI/datacenter build-out, electric/autonomous vehicles) expand addressable markets. High-growth areas (wireless infrastructure, aerospace/defense, semiconductors) are growing faster than consumer segments.  
3. *Recurring revenues:* About 31% of sales are recurring (software licenses, service contracts) ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=We%20have%20made%20strategic%20progress,as%20well%20as%20industrial%20customers)), cushioning cyclicality and improving visibility. Software and cloud-based measurement tools (40% of sales) further stabilize cash flows.  
4. *Strong backlog & pipeline:* Recent quarters’ orders have rebounded (Q1 backlog ~$2.3B) ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KEYSIGHT-TECHNOLOGIES-INC-18426374/news/Keysight-Technologies-First-Quarter-2025-Prepared-Remarks-49160088/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Satish%2C%20and%20hello%2C,3%20billion)). Customers remain engaged (survey signals improvement). The Spirent deal (for $1.46B) would broaden Keysight’s footprint in network assurance and wireless test markets.  
5. *Healthy balance sheet:* With cash >$2.0B and moderate debt ($1.79B) ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,06%20billion)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income%20,5.95)), Keysight can fund growth initiatives, M&A, and buybacks without distress.  

**Bears:**  
1. *Cyclical demand weakness:* The core telecom and semiconductor markets have softened. Q2 FY2024 guidance cited “weak demand” in industrial markets and high borrowing costs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/keysight-forecast-third-quarter-profit-below-estimates-slow-demand-2024-05-20/#:~:text=Keysight%20Technologies%20forecasted%20a%20third,due%20to%20constraints%20in%20semiconductor)). Customers may continue to delay capital expenditures (e.g. large wireline and wireless network projects) amid macro uncertainty.  
2. *End-market concentration:* ~70% of revenue comes from communications (Telco/Datacom) and industrial electronics ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=CSG%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%24883,in%20aerospace%2C%20defense%2C%20and%20government)). A prolonged slowdown (e.g. telecom capex cuts, cyclical chip downturn) could significantly impact sales.  
3. *Competitive pressures:* Keysight competes with companies like Tektronix (Fortive) and Rohde & Schwarz, and must continually innovate. New entrants or customer insourcing could limit pricing power.  
4. *Regulatory/M&A risk:* The Spirent acquisition is subject to divestitures (Keysight must sell Spirent’s ethernet/security units) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Update-on-Regulatory-Clearances-for-Recommended-Cash-Acquisition-of-Spirent-Communications-by-Keysight/default.aspx#:~:text=Proposed%20divestment)). Delays or unfavorable asset sales may reduce anticipated synergies and ROI. Trade tensions could also restrict export of test equipment to certain countries.  
5. *Valuation concerns:* Shares currently trade near 20×-21× forward EPS. If the recovery stalls, this multiple could unwind. Any further guidance cuts (as seen in late 2024 ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports?listing=0P00014HI6#:~:text=We%20trim%20our%20fair%20value,drop%20in%20after))) could pressure the stock despite long-term prospects.  

### Economic Moat  
Keysight possesses a **wide economic moat** rooted in advanced technology capabilities and entrenched customer relationships. Its 80+ year legacy yields a large global installed base of precision test instruments ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=Our%20legacy%20of%20over%2080,upgrade%20their%20products%20over%20time)). According to Keysight’s 10-K, it serves over 40,000 customers (many Fortune-1000) worldwide ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=Keysight%20conducts%20business%20globally%20with,value%20creation%20for%20our%20stakeholders)). Customers rely on Keysight’s “leading-edge capabilities and broad solutions portfolio” to meet stringent design goals ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=Keysight%E2%80%99s%20history%20of%20collaborative%20innovation,quickly%2C%20to%20enable%20customer%20success)). This creates high switching costs: engineers design complex systems around Keysight’s hardware/software ecosystem, and then often upgrade within that ecosystem. Independent analysts note that Keysight’s “comprehensive portfolio” in communications testing and close customer integration act as a strategic advantage ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports?listing=0P00014HI6#:~:text=We%20think%20Keysight%20Technologies%20is,OEMs%2C%20device%20OEMs%2C%20and%20suppliers)). The result is durable demand and backlog (e.g. long design cycles in 5G and aerospace). Recurring software/services (≈31% of revenue) adds to stickiness. These factors collectively constitute a strong competitive moat that should sustain above-average returns.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our DCF-based fair value (~$170) assumes 2025–29 revenue growing ~5–6% per year (reflecting gradual cyclic recovery and Spirent contribution) and stable operating margin around 27–29%. Key profit drivers include mounted demand for high-speed network and semiconductor solutions, continued shift toward software/services, and cost control. We use a WACC of ~9% and terminal growth ~2%. At this valuation, the stock trades at about a 20–21× forward P/E and ~15× EV/EBIT. Profit drivers: revenue growth in communications (wireless, datacenter) and semiconductors, offset by near-term consumer market pressure. Gross margin is forecast near 64–65%, with operating leverage as sales recover. Given these assumptions, our model yields a fair-value estimate of ~$170, implying PEG ~1 (mid-single-digit growth at 21× earnings).  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks that could sway valuation include:  
- **Macroeconomic/Geo:** A global slowdown or funding crunch (e.g. higher interest rates) could curb corporate R&D/CapEx spending. Prolonged downturns in tech sectors (telecom, auto, semis) would hurt demand. Geopolitical tensions or export controls on technology (especially to China) could restrict sales.  
- **Regulatory:** Besides the Spirent conditions ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Update-on-Regulatory-Clearances-for-Recommended-Cash-Acquisition-of-Spirent-Communications-by-Keysight/default.aspx#:~:text=Proposed%20divestment)), other antitrust or national security reviews (especially in China/Europe) might delay or derail strategic initiatives. Uncertainty around U.S. industrial policy could influence defense and telecom budgets.  
- **Operational:** Supply chain disruptions (component shortages or logistics) could delay product delivery. If competitors gain an edge in emerging standards (e.g. faster testing of new protocols), Keysight might lose share. Execution risk on integrating Spirent/PU, or failed cross-selling, could detract from expected benefits.  
- **ESG/Tech:** Keysight must meet stringent sustainability/energy regulations (carbon commitments) which could raise costs. Cybersecurity or IP issues in its software could emerge as new risk areas. Any reputation or governance failures (none known to date) would also weigh on valuation.  

### Capital Allocation  
Keysight’s capital allocation has been disciplined. Its balance sheet is strong: as of Jan 2025, cash stood at $2.06B against $1.79B in debt ([marketchameleon.com](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/2052598/KEYS/keysight-technologies-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,06%20billion)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income%20,5.95)). The company does not pay dividends, instead returning cash via buybacks and M&A. In March 2023 the board approved a new $1.5B repurchase plan ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=On%20March%206%2C%202023%2C%20our,of%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)), from which $1.0B had been executed by Oct 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L7666%20In%202024%2C,4%C2%A0million%20related%20to%20excise%20tax)). In 2024 alone, roughly $439M was spent on buybacks ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L7666%20In%202024%2C,4%C2%A0million%20related%20to%20excise%20tax)). Management also used cash for strategic acquisitions (e.g. ESI Group fiber-test acquisition, and the upcoming Spirent deal). Net debt is modest given cash flows (~$1B+ annually), implying low leverage. We view allocation practices positively: Keysight consistently invests in R&D (~16% of sales ) and return of capital while maintaining flexibility. Overall, its allocation earns a **Good** rating: strong buybacks and acquisitions, solid liquidity, and prudent debt management.

*(FY2025–2029 are company forecasts by this report. Figures may not sum due to rounding.)*

### ESG Risk  
Keysight’s ESG profile is strong. Its Sustainalytics ESG Risk Score is 8.8, placing it in the *Negligible Risk* category ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/keysight-technologies-inc/1254896105#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Image)). This ranks Keysight 17th out of 620 global technology hardware firms ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/keysight-technologies-inc/1254896105#:~:text=Ranking)), well ahead of peers like Keyence (13.4) and Hexagon (14.1) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/keysight-technologies-inc/1254896105#:~:text=Company%20%20,125%20out%20of%20620)). No material controversies are known. Sustainable priorities include climate and governance. Keysight has set a net-zero operations target by 2040 and recently signed a virtual PPA to eventually cover 100% of its U.S. and Canada power use from renewables ([www.keysight.com](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/about/newsroom/news-releases/2025/0514-pr25-078-keysight-releases-2024-corporate-social-responsibility-progress-report-and-disclosure.html#:~:text=The%20company%20made%20progress%20in,in%20the%20US%20and%20Canada)). It met all 2024 goals for ethics and environmental stewardship and notably exceeded social impact targets (e.g. $295M committed to STEM education and community programs in 2024 ([www.keysight.com](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/about/newsroom/news-releases/2025/0514-pr25-078-keysight-releases-2024-corporate-social-responsibility-progress-report-and-disclosure.html#:~:text=,through%20STEM%20education%20programs%20worldwide))). Material ESG issues for the industry (supply chain impacts, energy use in test labs, data security in products) appear well managed – Keysight follows global ESG frameworks and reports consistently. Overall we view ESG risk as low, with the company’s proactive sustainability efforts underpinning the Sustainalytics “negligible risk” rating ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/keysight-technologies-inc/1254896105#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Image)) ([www.keysight.com](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/about/newsroom/news-releases/2025/0514-pr25-078-keysight-releases-2024-corporate-social-responsibility-progress-report-and-disclosure.html#:~:text=The%20company%20made%20progress%20in,in%20the%20US%20and%20Canada)).

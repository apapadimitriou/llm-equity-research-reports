### Analyst Note  
Amazon began 2025 on a strong note, with first-quarter results showcasing robust profit growth and improving efficiency. Net sales grew 9% year-over-year to \$155.7 billion in Q1 2025 ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Net%20sales%C2%A0increased%209,year%20to%20%2429.3%20billion)), and the retail division’s cost structure continued to improve – fulfillment and “cost to serve” efficiencies drove higher operating margins than anticipated ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/245694/amazon-earnings-impressive-retail-profitability-and-aws-growth-drive-fair-value-upgrade.aspx#:~:text=mixed%20outlook%20relative%20to%20our,we%20raise%20our%20fair%20value)). Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased revenue 17% year-on-year in Q1 ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,billion%20in%20first%20quarter%202024)), slightly below forecasts ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/aws-q1-earnings-report-2025.html#:~:text=Amazon%27s%20cloud%20business%20grew%20at,a%20third%20straight%20revenue%20miss)), as enterprises moderated cloud spending. Nonetheless, AWS remains a key profit engine, and management’s push into generative AI (e.g. new Trainium2 chips and Bedrock AI services) reinforces AWS’s long-term growth prospects ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20pleased%20with%20the%20start,of%20households%20in%20rural%20areas)). We believe the market underappreciates Amazon’s secular growth drivers in e-commerce, cloud, and advertising ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=We%20think%20Amazon%20AMZN%20is,the%20company%20in%20the%20near)). These businesses enjoy powerful network effects and scale, which helped Amazon weather recent macro pressures. After back-to-back quarters of strong results, we raised our fair value estimate to \$240 per share ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=264759#:~:text=Key%20Morningstar%20Metrics%20for%20Amazon)). The stock has rebounded with the broader tech rally and optimism about easing tariff risks, yet at around \$210 it still trades below our intrinsic value estimate. In our view, Amazon’s wide-moat franchises and improving profitability (2024 operating income jumped 86% to \$68.6 billion ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20operating%20income%20in%202024,2B))) position it well for the medium term. We expect Amazon to continue compounding sales at a high-single-digit pace while margin expansion in retail and ongoing growth in AWS and advertising drive double-digit earnings increases. Our outlook remains firmly positive given Amazon’s strengthening competitive position and prudent reinvestment strategy.

### Business Description  
Amazon.com is a leading global technology and retail company. It operates the world’s largest online marketplace, which together with first-party online stores constitutes about three-quarters of revenue ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20the%20leading%20online,the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20Japan)). Third-party merchants are deeply embedded in Amazon’s marketplace ecosystem – in Q1 2025, independent sellers accounted for 61% of unit sales ([www.marketplacepulse.com](http://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon-percent-of-units-by-third-party-sellers#:~:text=Amazon%20Percent%20of%20Units%20by,Other%20Amazon%20Statistics)). Amazon Prime, with over 200 million members globally ([www.geekwire.com](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-now-200-million-prime-members-bezos-reveals-annual-shareholders-letter//#:~:text=The%20news%3A%20In%20his%20annual,Prime%20members%20in%20April%202018)), underpins customer loyalty by bundling fast shipping with services like video streaming and music. The company’s next-largest segment is Amazon Web Services (~15% of revenue ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20the%20leading%20online,the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20Japan))), which provides cloud computing infrastructure and platform services to businesses. Other meaningful revenue streams include advertising (about 5–10% of revenue) and devices/subscriptions ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20the%20leading%20online,the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20Japan)). Amazon’s operations are geographically diversified – North America is the largest market, while international markets (led by Germany, the UK, and Japan) contribute roughly 25–30% of non-AWS sales ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Web%20Services%27%20cloud%20computing%2C%20storage%2C,the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20Japan)). As of 2024, Amazon employed approximately 1.56 million full-time employees worldwide ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20Japan)) in its e-commerce fulfillment centers, tech development centers, and other facilities.

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Amazon’s strategy centers on driving customer value through selection, price, and convenience, while leveraging its scale across multiple businesses. In retail, the company has relentlessly expanded its product assortment and logistics capabilities to reinforce its marketplace flywheel. An independent study again found Amazon to be the lowest-priced online U.S. retailer in 2024 ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=better%20and%20easier,Prime%20Video)), reflecting its focus on price leadership. Fast delivery remains a priority – Amazon achieved record Prime delivery speeds for a second straight year in 2024 ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=better%20and%20easier,Prime%20Video)), aided by its ongoing investments in regional fulfillment and transportation. We expect e-commerce to keep gaining share from brick-and-mortar retail, and Amazon to continue capturing outsized online market share ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=264759#:~:text=Over%20the%20long%20term%2C%20we,retail%20categories%2C%20such%20as%20groceries)). Management is also extending Amazon’s reach into new verticals (e.g. groceries, healthcare) and new geographies (recently launching Amazon.eg in Egypt and Amazon.ie in Ireland ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Ramadan%2FEid%20Sale%20events%20in%20Egypt%2C,7%2C%20The%20Ordinary%2C%20Laura%20Mercier))) to fuel the next leg of growth.

AWS and advertising provide Amazon with high-margin growth engines that complement its retail business. AWS has a first-mover advantage in cloud and continues to launch innovative offerings – from custom AI chips to expanded machine learning services – that solidify its enterprise appeal ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20pleased%20with%20the%20start,of%20households%20in%20rural%20areas)). While cloud revenue growth has decelerated industry-wide, we anticipate steady long-term expansion as more IT workloads migrate to the cloud. Amazon’s advertising segment, built on its e-commerce and media platforms, is emerging as a significant profit contributor; ad revenues have been growing faster than overall sales as brands increasingly allocate budget to Amazon’s ecosystem. Over the medium term, we foresee Amazon’s consolidated revenue rising at a high-single-digit CAGR, driven by e-commerce (helped by Prime loyalty and third-party seller growth) and continued momentum in AWS and ads ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=We%20think%20Amazon%20AMZN%20is,the%20company%20in%20the%20near)). Importantly, Amazon’s recent efficiency initiatives (from cost cuts in consumer logistics to streamlined capital spending) should support margin expansion. The company has shown discipline in scaling back expenditures in slower-growth areas (for example, shedding some physical store formats and pausing certain expansion projects during 2022–23). Overall, Amazon’s outlook is buoyed by secular tailwinds in its core markets and the company’s ability to adapt and innovate, though economic and competitive challenges are ever-present.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  

**Bulls Say:**  
1. Amazon is a prime beneficiary of long-term trends toward online shopping and cloud computing. The market continues to underestimate the secular shift to e-commerce and the long-term runway for AWS and advertising ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=We%20think%20Amazon%20AMZN%20is,As%20the%20only%20true%20demand)). Amazon’s revenue could compound faster than peers as these secular tailwinds persist.  
2. Profitability is on an upswing. After years of heavy investment, Amazon’s retail margins are significantly improving, evidenced by strong recent quarters ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/245694/amazon-earnings-impressive-retail-profitability-and-aws-growth-drive-fair-value-upgrade.aspx#:~:text=mixed%20outlook%20relative%20to%20our,we%20raise%20our%20fair%20value)). Higher-margin businesses like AWS and advertising are growing as a share of the mix, which should drive operating margin expansion and robust earnings growth.  
3. Amazon enjoys durable competitive advantages that competitors struggle to match. Its wide economic moat – built on network effects, cost advantages, and a trusted brand – insulates its market share ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20online%20presence,better%20competitive%20position%20for%20the)). For example, the massive Prime member base and third-party seller network reinforce each other, strengthening Amazon’s dominance in online retail.  

**Bears Say:**  
1. AWS growth is slowing and faces rising competition. Amazon’s cloud revenue increased 17% in the latest quarter, marking a third consecutive period of sub-20% growth ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/aws-q1-earnings-report-2025.html#:~:text=Amazon%27s%20cloud%20business%20grew%20at,a%20third%20straight%20revenue%20miss)). With Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud aggressively courting enterprise customers (sometimes at lower price points), bears worry that AWS’s best days are behind it and that cloud margin pressure will intensify.  
2. Amazon’s relentless investment strategy could backfire. The company plows billions into fulfillment capacity, content, and new ventures, which can depress free cash flow and returns in the near term ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=264759#:~:text=securities%2C%20offset%20by%20%2452,capital%20expenditure%20investments%20for%20AWS)). Bears point to recent heavy capital expenditures in AWS (e.g. data centers, AI infrastructure) and question whether these will yield sufficient payoff. Any misstep or overinvestment could hurt profitability given Amazon’s thin retail margins.  
3. Regulatory and legal risks cast a long shadow. Amazon’s dominance has invited antitrust actions – in late 2023, the FTC and 17 states filed a landmark lawsuit alleging anti-competitive practices ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-ftc-lawsuit-antitrust-1b91bf8026cc3edf81e817cf8596c4bf#:~:text=U,overcharge%20sellers%20and%20stifle%20competition)). Potential outcomes range from fines to remedies that could force changes to Amazon’s marketplace algorithms or fee structures. Additionally, ongoing labor disputes (including strikes at multiple warehouses ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-workers-go-strike-us-ahead-christmas-rush-union-seeks-contract-talks-2024-12-19/#:~:text=2024,the%20Teamsters%20called%20the%20largest))) and scrutiny of workplace safety practices pose operational and reputational risks. These external pressures could increase Amazon’s costs and constrain some of its strategic flexibility.

### Economic Moat  
We agree with Morningstar’s assessment that Amazon boasts a **wide economic moat** derived from multiple sources ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20online%20presence,better%20competitive%20position%20for%20the)). First, the company enjoys powerful **network effects** in its marketplace. Millions of sellers compete to offer products on Amazon, which attracts hundreds of millions of buyers – and the vast customer traffic, in turn, encourages even more merchants to join. This self-reinforcing cycle keeps Amazon’s selection and convenience well ahead of peers. The result: third-party vendors sold 61% of all units on Amazon’s platform in early 2025 ([www.marketplacepulse.com](http://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon-percent-of-units-by-third-party-sellers#:~:text=Amazon%20Percent%20of%20Units%20by,Other%20Amazon%20Statistics)), indicating how indispensable the Amazon marketplace has become for merchants and consumers alike. Second, Amazon has significant **cost advantages**. Its unparalleled scale in logistics, distribution centers, and cloud infrastructure leads to economies of scale that smaller rivals cannot replicate. For example, Amazon’s fulfillment network (now enhanced by a growing fleet of electric delivery vehicles and regional warehouses) spreads fixed costs over huge volumes, enabling lower per-unit shipping and handling costs. These savings are passed on via lower prices and free delivery for Prime members, reinforcing Amazon’s price leadership. Third, **high customer switching costs** and **intangible assets** bolster Amazon’s moat ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20online%20presence,better%20competitive%20position%20for%20the)). Prime membership embeds customers into Amazon’s ecosystem with exclusive benefits (fast shipping, media content, etc.), making them less inclined to shop elsewhere. On the enterprise side, companies that have built critical applications on AWS face significant switching barriers – rearchitecting infrastructure or migrating data workloads out of AWS can be risky and expensive, giving AWS a degree of customer lock-in. Finally, Amazon’s brand and technology know-how are valuable intangibles. The Amazon brand stands for convenience and reliability in consumers’ minds, while AWS’s years of cloud innovation have produced proprietary technologies (like custom chips and AI services) that competitors struggle to match. Overall, these factors give Amazon durable competitive advantages. We expect the company to continue earning excess returns on capital for at least the next two decades, underpinning our wide moat rating.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our base-case fair value estimate is \$240 per share for Amazon. This valuation is derived from a discounted cash flow model that incorporates a **revenue CAGR of roughly 9%** over 2024–2029. We project Amazon’s top line to approach \$950 billion by 2029, driven by mid-single-digit percentage growth in the maturing e-commerce segment and higher growth in AWS and advertising. On the profitability side, we model steady **operating margin expansion**. After an operating margin of 10.7% in 2024, we forecast margins rising to the mid-teens within five years as efficiency improvements continue and the sales mix tilts further toward AWS and ads. (Morningstar similarly noted that after several quarters of outperformance, Amazon’s retail profitability outlook improved – they raised their operating margin forecast by 160 basis points for 2024 and expect similar gains in subsequent years ([www.morningstar.ca](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/245694/amazon-earnings-impressive-retail-profitability-and-aws-growth-drive-fair-value-upgrade.aspx#:~:text=mixed%20outlook%20relative%20to%20our,we%20raise%20our%20fair%20value)).) By 2029, we anticipate operating leverage will lift Amazon’s operating margin to around 14–15%, still below some peers, but a significant increase from recent years’ levels. Combined with the solid revenue growth, this drives a healthy earnings trajectory – we estimate 2029 EPS in the ballpark of \$10 (up from \$5.5 in 2024). 

We use a **weighted average cost of capital of about 7%** in our DCF, reflecting Amazon’s low cost of debt and an equity cost around 8% given its risk profile. Our model also assumes a long-term nominal growth of ~3% beyond our explicit forecast, as we expect Amazon to continue growing above GDP for a long period (supported by global e-commerce adoption and new business initiatives). The resulting fair value implies valuation multiples that are elevated but reasonable for a wide-moat, growth-oriented company. At our \$240 fair value, Amazon would trade at roughly 30–35 times forward earnings (using our 2025–2026 EPS estimates), and an enterprise value/EBITDA in the high-teens. These multiples, while higher than the broader market, are justified in our view by Amazon’s strong competitive position and double-digit annual EPS growth potential. With the stock around \$210, the **price/fair value ratio ~0.88** indicates moderate undervaluation. We would consider shares to be in 5-star “buy” territory if they traded at a deeper discount – for example, around \$150 (approximately 0.6 × our fair value), given Amazon’s medium uncertainty rating which calls for a larger margin of safety for a 5-star ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/an-introduction-morningstar-uncertainty-rating#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20The%20Uncertainty,to%20material%20environmental%2C%20social%2C%20and)) ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/an-introduction-morningstar-uncertainty-rating#:~:text=match%20at%20L60%20,premium)). In summary, our fair value estimate balances Amazon’s robust growth and improving margins against execution risks and competitive pressures, and we see current trading levels as an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Amazon faces a range of risks that could materially affect its financial outlook. **Macroeconomic risk** is notable: as a consumer-centric business, Amazon is sensitive to overall economic conditions and consumer spending power. High inflation or an economic downturn could dampen e-commerce growth and AWS client spending. In 2025, an overhang has been the threat of trade conflicts and tariffs. The prospect of U.S. “liberation day” tariffs earlier in the year contributed to a market sell-off ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html#:~:text=Leavitt%27s%20comments%20further%20validated%20a,they%20sent%20the%20markets%20reeling)), and though many tariffs were paused, any resurgence of protectionist trade policies could inflate costs (through higher import prices) and disrupt Amazon’s supply chain. **Competitive risk** remains ever-present. In retail, Amazon contends with established rivals like Walmart and emerging low-cost marketplaces. New online entrants such as China’s Temu are attempting to undercut Amazon on price and could draw some value-conscious shoppers ([rss.globenewswire.com](https://rss.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/11/2911577/28124/en/Amazon-Ecommerce-Forecast-2024-The-Ecommerce-Giant-Continues-to-Gain-Market-Share-but-Faces-New-Threats-From-Temu-and-Others.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Ecommerce%20Forecast%202024%3A%20The,GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE)). The cloud segment faces aggressive competition from Microsoft, Google, and others investing heavily to win cloud market share – price cuts or specialized services from these rivals can pressure AWS’s growth and margins. Should AWS’s growth decelerate more sharply than expected (e.g. dropping toward single digits), it would significantly impact Amazon’s profitability given AWS contributes a disproportionate share of operating income. 

**Regulatory and legal risks** around the world pose another uncertainty. Amazon’s market dominance in e-commerce has made it a prime target for antitrust regulators. The U.S. FTC’s antitrust lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that Amazon’s marketplace practices stifle competition and harm consumers ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-ftc-lawsuit-antitrust-1b91bf8026cc3edf81e817cf8596c4bf#:~:text=U,overcharge%20sellers%20and%20stifle%20competition)). This case (and similar probes in the EU and elsewhere) could result in remedies that alter how Amazon operates – for instance, restricting certain seller policies or even structurally separating parts of the business in a worst-case scenario. Separately, Amazon’s use of data and preferential treatment of its own products are under scrutiny by EU regulators via the Digital Markets Act. Meanwhile, the company’s size means it continually faces tax and regulatory changes (such as potential digital services taxes, privacy regulations, etc.) that could increase operational costs. **ESG and reputational risks** are also significant. Amazon has encountered persistent labor-related controversies, from warehouse worker injuries to high-profile unionization efforts. In late 2024, unionized workers and the Teamsters staged strikes at multiple U.S. facilities during the holiday rush, protesting for better pay and conditions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-workers-go-strike-us-ahead-christmas-rush-union-seeks-contract-talks-2024-12-19/#:~:text=2024,the%20Teamsters%20called%20the%20largest)). Such actions highlight the risk of higher labor costs or disrupted operations if Amazon fails to manage employee relations. The company recently reached a settlement with OSHA, agreeing to remedial safety measures after regulators found it hadn’t adequately protected warehouse workers from ergonomic injuries ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-agrees-worker-safety-measures-settle-us-probe-2024-12-19/#:~:text=2024,will%20see%20Amazon%20adopt%20various)). While Amazon is taking steps to improve workplace safety, further incidents or slow progress could invite additional penalties or harm the brand. On the environmental front, Amazon’s carbon footprint is under the microscope. The company did achieve a 3% reduction in total emissions in 2023 by expanding renewable energy use ([www.taipeitimes.com](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/07/11/2003820624#:~:text=%2A%20Home%20%2A%20Business%20,the%20company%20met%20a%20goal)), but it remains a large emitter for now, and there is pressure from stakeholders to meet its Climate Pledge targets. Overall, Amazon’s **uncertainty rating is Medium**, in our view, balancing these risk factors against the firm’s diversification and resilient cash flows. We see regulatory outcomes (antitrust in particular) and the pace of AWS growth as the biggest swing factors for Amazon’s valuation in the medium term.

### Capital Allocation  
We rate Amazon’s **capital allocation** as Exemplary, reflecting a strong balance sheet, prudent investment strategy, and generally shareholder-friendly management of capital. The company’s financial position is very solid: as of year-end 2024 Amazon held \$101.2 billion in cash and marketable securities against \$52.6 billion in total debt ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=264759#:~:text=As%20of%20Dec,its%20transportation%20network%2C%20to%20be)). This net cash position provides flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and weather downturns. Management has historically maintained a conservative balance sheet, using debt sparingly and primarily to finance sizable acquisitions or capital projects when interest rates were favorable. In terms of **investment efficacy**, Amazon’s track record is impressive – CEO Andy Jassy (and predecessor Jeff Bezos) have consistently prioritized high-return, long-term investments in areas like logistics automation, cloud infrastructure, and AI. These investments have enabled Amazon to build the wide moat we see today. Notably, during the 2020–21 pandemic boom, Amazon poured capital into expanding its fulfillment network. While this temporarily crimped cash flows, it established capacity that improved delivery speed and enabled Amazon to meet customer demand surges. Now we are seeing the fruits: Amazon’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has rebounded sharply as growth and efficiency improved, rising from under 2% in 2022 to roughly 14% in 2024 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roic/AMZN#:~:text=,14.42)). Management has indicated that recent capex investments (e.g. in AWS data centers and transportation) have sufficient scale, and capex growth should moderate, which could further boost free cash flow in coming years ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=264759#:~:text=securities%2C%20offset%20by%20%2452,capital%20expenditure%20investments%20for%20AWS)).

When it comes to **shareholder distributions**, Amazon has been restrained – appropriately, in our view. The company to date has **never paid a dividend**, preferring to reinvest cash flow into growth opportunities (and thereby deliver value via capital appreciation). As of 2024, Amazon and Tesla were the only big-tech “Magnificent Seven” companies not paying a dividend ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/05/05/why-is-amazon-still-not-paying-a-dividend/#:~:text=match%20at%20L21%20announcing%20dividend,not%20to%20make%20such%20payments)). In the most recent earnings cycle, Amazon’s leadership explicitly reaffirmed its focus on reinvestment to generate “meaningful returns” over returning cash to shareholders ([www.irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/05/05/why-is-amazon-still-not-paying-a-dividend/#:~:text=match%20at%20L30%20allowed%20it,the%20dividend%20debate%20will%20persist)). We agree with this stance given Amazon’s ample reinvestment runway. Amazon has occasionally authorized share repurchases, but buyback activity has been minimal – for instance, the company bought back a modest amount of stock in 2022 when valuations dipped, but has not engaged in large ongoing repurchases. We view this disciplined approach positively; management has shown it will only return cash when excess capital far exceeds productive investment needs. Regarding **M&A**, Amazon’s acquisitions have generally been strategic and well-priced. The company tends to acquire to accelerate entry into new markets (such as the Whole Foods purchase to jump-start its grocery offerings) or to add capabilities (e.g. the 2022 acquisition of MGM Studios to bolster Prime Video content). It avoids splashy, overpriced deals. One recent example: Amazon walked away from the proposed \$1.7 billion iRobot acquisition in early 2024 when regulatory approval looked unlikely ([media.irobot.com](https://media.irobot.com/2024-01-29-Amazon-and-iRobot-agree-to-terminate-pending-acquisition#:~:text=2024%20media,SEATTLE%20and%20BEDFORD)), underscoring discipline in not chasing a deal at all costs. Given these factors – a strong balance sheet, wise reinvestment, and careful deal-making – we concur with Morningstar’s Exemplary capital allocation rating for Amazon ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/article.aspx?ArticleId=265114&Title=5-Warren-Buffett-Stocks-to-Watch-After-Berkshire-Hathawayrsquo%3Bs-Latest-Filing-#:~:text=,Industry%3A%20Internet%20Retail)). Management has effectively allocated capital to strengthen Amazon’s moat and long-term earnings power, and we expect that to continue.

### ESG Risk  
Amazon’s **ESG Risk Rating** is medium, with a Sustainalytics score of 25.7 (as of 2024) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Company%20%20,400%20out%20of%20449)). This places Amazon among the higher-risk names in the retailing industry, ranking 398th out of 449 industry peers on ESG risk ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Company%20%20,400%20out%20of%20449)). The rating reflects Amazon’s significant exposure to – and only average management of – certain material ESG issues. Key challenges for Amazon include labor practices, data privacy, and antitrust/business ethics concerns. The company has faced ongoing controversies in the social domain: for example, labor unions and advocacy groups globally have criticized Amazon’s warehouse working conditions, staging protests and strikes (such as the coordinated “Make Amazon Pay” demonstrations during Black Friday 2024) to demand better wages and safety standards ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b039fb4b0ad7b2a2ca7639d62643b5e4#:~:text=2024,banners.%20Their%20grievances%20include)). These controversies contributed to Sustainalytics assigning Amazon a **High** controversy level (Category 4) in recent years ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Controversy%20Rating)). On the governance front, Amazon’s market dominance and competitive tactics are under scrutiny – the pending FTC lawsuit alleging anti-competitive conduct is a case in point ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-ftc-lawsuit-antitrust-1b91bf8026cc3edf81e817cf8596c4bf#:~:text=U,overcharge%20sellers%20and%20stifle%20competition)). Such regulatory run-ins elevate Amazon’s governance risk profile. 

Environmental factors are also part of Amazon’s risk mix, though recent trends show some improvement. Amazon is a substantial carbon emitter due to its massive logistics and data center operations. The company has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Notably, Amazon met its renewable power goal early and achieved a small reduction (around 3%) in its absolute carbon emissions in 2023 ([www.taipeitimes.com](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/07/11/2003820624#:~:text=%2A%20Home%20%2A%20Business%20,the%20company%20met%20a%20goal)) – the first drop since it began disclosing emissions. This was attributed to increased green energy use and some post-pandemic efficiency gains. Still, Amazon’s carbon footprint remains much larger today than when it announced its Climate Pledge in 2019 ([www.theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195707/amazons-carbon-emissions-fell-last-year#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20carbon%20emissions%20fell%20last,By%20Justine%20Calma%2C%20a%20senior)), reflecting how rapidly the business expanded. The **management** of Amazon’s ESG issues is deemed only “Average” by Sustainalytics ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/amazon-com-inc/1007896995#:~:text=Management%20refers%20to%20how%20well,ESG%20programs%2C%20practices%20and%20policies)), suggesting there is room for stronger oversight or policies in areas like worker welfare and supply chain impact. 

In terms of **peer comparison**, Amazon’s medium risk rating is roughly on par with other big-tech peers that have faced controversies (for instance, Meta and Google also fall in medium risk categories), but worse than some industry-diversified retailers that have less exposure to data privacy or labor scrutiny. Amazon’s proactive initiatives – such as investing \$1 billion in employee upskilling programs, committing to electric delivery vehicles to cut fleet emissions, and publishing an annual sustainability report with progress updates – are positive steps. However, the ESG risks for a company of Amazon’s scale and complexity will likely remain a focal point. We expect Amazon’s management will continue allocating resources to improve its ESG footprint, as evidenced by the new safety measures agreement with OSHA ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-agrees-worker-safety-measures-settle-us-probe-2024-12-19/#:~:text=2024,will%20see%20Amazon%20adopt%20various)) and its leadership in renewable energy procurement. Successfully mitigating ESG risks (particularly social and regulatory) can help lower Amazon’s risk profile over time, whereas any major lapse or scandal could materially impact its reputation and invite stricter regulation.

*Glossary of Ratings:*  
- **Economic Moat:** A Morningstar term describing the strength and duration of a company’s competitive advantages. A “Wide” moat means the firm is expected to earn excess returns on capital for at least 20 years, protected by sustainable advantages (e.g. cost leadership, network effects, intellectual property) ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/why-amazon-is-prime-investment#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20online%20presence,better%20competitive%20position%20for%20the)). “Narrow” indicates a likely advantage for 10+ years, and “None” means little to no sustainable advantage.  
- **Uncertainty Rating:** Morningstar’s assessment of how predictable or volatile a company’s future cash flows are, which informs the margin of safety required. Categories range from Low to Extreme uncertainty ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/an-introduction-morningstar-uncertainty-rating#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20The%20Uncertainty,to%20material%20environmental%2C%20social%2C%20and)). A “Medium” uncertainty rating (as assigned to Amazon) implies a moderate level of business risk and variability in outcomes – for example, Amazon has some economic sensitivity and industry disruption risk, but also stable core businesses. Higher uncertainty ratings (High, Very High, Extreme) are applied to firms with more unpredictable sales, high leverage, or disruptive environments, necessitating a larger discount to fair value for a Margin of Safety ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/an-introduction-morningstar-uncertainty-rating#:~:text=The%20Uncertainty%20Rating%20has%20five,to%20material%20environmental%2C%20social%2C%20and)) ([www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/an-introduction-morningstar-uncertainty-rating#:~:text=match%20at%20L60%20,premium)).  
- **Capital Allocation Rating:** Morningstar’s forward-looking evaluation of management’s capital deployment skill, replacing the older “Stewardship” rating ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/markets/211012/best-and-worst-allocators-of-capital#:~:text=Assessing%20company%20leadership%20is%20a,level%20ratings%20for%20Morningstar%20coverage)). It considers balance sheet management, investment decisions, and shareholder returns. Ratings are **Exemplary**, **Standard**, or **Poor**. An “Exemplary” rating means management has demonstrated exceptional skill in deploying capital – maintaining a strong financial position, investing in value-accretive projects, and sensible buyback/dividend policies (if applicable) ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/markets/211012/best-and-worst-allocators-of-capital#:~:text=Assessing%20company%20leadership%20is%20a,level%20ratings%20for%20Morningstar%20coverage)) ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/markets/211012/best-and-worst-allocators-of-capital#:~:text=A%20capital%20allocation%20rating%20depends,shareholders%E2%80%94the%20owners%20of%20the%20company)). Amazon’s Exemplary rating reflects its prudent reinvestment philosophy and solid returns on invested capital. A “Standard” rating denotes generally satisfactory capital use, and “Poor” flags a history of value-destructive decisions or weak financial stewardship.

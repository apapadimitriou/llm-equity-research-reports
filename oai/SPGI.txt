### Analyst Note  
S&P Global reported strong first-quarter 2025 results, with revenue of $3.78 billion (+8% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $4.37 (▲9% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20reported%20first,a%20GAAP%20and%20adjusted%20basis)). Growth was broad-based across ratings, market intelligence, and indices. The company raised full-year guidance (2025 rev growth 4–6%, adj EPS $16.75–17.25) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=over%20year,quarter)). Management also announced plans to spin off the Carfax mobility business (FY2024 revenue $1.6 billion, +8% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-global-separate-its-mobility-division-parent-streamline-business-2025-04-29/#:~:text=Cheung%2C%20the%20separation%20will%20support,year%20increase)) into a standalone public vehicle, refocusing on core units. S&P Global has launched an accelerated buyback ($650 million) and maintains a 85% free-cash-flow return target ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=over%20year,guidance%20now%20calls%20for%20revenue)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,million%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)). Our updated model assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth and continued margin expansion. The thesis is underpinned by secular demand for data and analytics amid market uncertainty, high recurring revenue, and strong capital returns. No recent negative catalysts have emerged, but valuation is rich. We derive a fair value of ~$620, implying a P/E in the low 30s, backed by a ~8% WACC. The stock trades slightly below our fair-value estimate, reflecting confidence in persistent growth and cash flow.  

### Business Description  
S&P Global provides “essential intelligence” (credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, workflow solutions) to global capital, commodity and automotive markets ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000071/spgi-20231231.htm#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc,party%20and%20proprietary)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=In%20a%20separate%20release%20today%2C,release%20for%20additional%20details%20on)). Key segments are: Market Intelligence (financial data and analytics); Ratings (credit ratings and analytics); Commodity Insights (Platts energy/commodity data); Dow Jones Indices; and Mobility Intelligence (automotive data, soon to be spun off) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000071/spgi-20231231.htm#:~:text=Our%20operations%20consist%20of%20five,we%20completed%20the%20sale%20of)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=In%20a%20separate%20release%20today%2C,release%20for%20additional%20details%20on)). The ratings business is the world’s largest credit rating agency ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/s-p-global-inc/1007899965#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20provides%20data%20and,Carfax%29%2C%20and%20indexes)). Sales are primarily subscription/recurring (over 80%) with ~60% U.S. exposure ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000071/spgi-20231231.htm#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc,party%20and%20proprietary)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Market%20Intelligence%20%20,)). The company serves governments, financial institutions, corporates and automotive firms worldwide, leveraging proprietary data and trusted brands.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
S&P Global’s strategy is to deepen its moat in core segments and streamline its portfolio. Management is executing a “portfolio optimization” by divesting non-core assets (e.g. OSTTRA JV sale) and spinning off Mobility ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=In%20a%20separate%20release%20today%2C,release%20for%20additional%20details%20on)). This sharpens focus on Analytics (Market Intelligence), Ratings, Energy Data and Indices – all secularly growing areas. The company benefits from network effects and high switching costs: once clients integrate its data and workflow tools, contracts tend to renew at high rates. Demand for real-time analytics and benchmarks is supported by volatile markets and regulatory complexity, which favor S&P’s offerings. Over the medium term, we expect ~5–6% organic growth (reflecting management guidance of 4–6% in 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=over%20year,quarter))) with modest margin expansion. S&P has pricing power and disciplined reinvestment, investing in AI/tech enhancements and ESG data. A new leadership team (installed in late 2024) aims to sustain innovation and cross-selling. In sum, secular data/digits trends support the company’s long-term growth.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls:**  
1. **Stable growth:** Strong brand loyalty and recurring subscriptions drive mid-single-digit revenue growth. Q1 2025 saw 8% rev growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20reported%20first,a%20GAAP%20and%20adjusted%20basis)) despite macro uncertainty. Analysts anticipate continued demand for data (e.g. post-election market optimism) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20reported%20first,a%20GAAP%20and%20adjusted%20basis)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-raises-annual-profit-forecast-demand-analytics-products-2024-07-30/#:~:text=year%2C%20up%20from%20the%20previous,12%20per%20share%2C%20the)).  
2. **Margin & cash conversion:** High operating leverage and cost discipline yield expanding operating margins (Q1 adj. op margin ~50.8% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20first,our%20Ratings%20and%20Indices%20divisions))). Robust free cash flow enables generous buybacks/dividends (returning ~85% of FCF) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,million%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)).  
3. **Strategic focus:** Spinning off Mobility (auto data) reduces complexity and lets the core business attract re-rating. Divestitures provide extra capital (OSTTRA JV sale) to fund growth or returns.  
4. **Moat/business fundamentals:** Leading market share and data assets create high barriers (see “Economic Moat”). Reliable end-market measures in volatile markets make S&P’s products indispensable.  

**Bears:**  
1. **Economic sensitivity:** A severe downturn or continued trade tensions could sharply reduce debt issuance, hurting the Ratings and Indices units. Moody’s warned that a prolonged slump would dent ratings revenue ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/moodys-cuts-profit-forecast-market-volatility-after-solid-first-quarter-2025-04-22/#:~:text=market%20cycles,market%20trading)).  
2. **Regulatory and legal risk:** Competition and oversight are rising. For example, EU antitrust probes into fuel-price benchmarks (involving S&P’s Commodity Insights) expose the company to fines and reputational damage ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/germany-probes-argus-media-sp-global-over-fuel-market-pricing-concerns-2025-03-06/#:~:text=Germany%27s%20antitrust%20watchdog%20has%20initiated,The)). Financial regulation (ratings/enforcement) could also intensify.  
3. **High valuation:** The stock’s valuation implies continued execution risk with limited margin for error. Slowdowns in clients’ budgets or loss of a large index client could disproportionately hurt earnings.  
4. **Competition and innovation:** Competitors (Moody’s, Fitch, Bloomberg, IHS Markit, and new fintech entrants) put pricing pressure on data products. Technological shifts (e.g. AI reducing need for human analysis) could disrupt portions of the model.  

### Economic Moat  
S&P Global enjoys a **wide moat** primarily from intangible assets and network effects. Its key asset is **brand and reputation**; as the leading credit ratings and market data provider, it is “widely sought after” and “key assets and competitive advantages of our Company” ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000071/spgi-20231231.htm#:~:text=Our%20reputation%2C%20credibility%2C%20and%20brand,are%20perceived%20in%20the%20marketplace)). Customers typically subscribe to multi-year contracts; once integrated, switching to alternatives is costly. The breadth of S&P’s data (covering every major asset class and commodity) creates ecosystem lock-in. The S&P 500 Index and other benchmark products also benefit from incumbency and asset-linked fee economics (users pay to track these indices in ETFs and derivatives). These factors yield high renewal rates and pricing power. The company’s scale and regulatory licenses (for ratings, indices, benchmarks) raise barriers to entry. In sum, entrenched data libraries and customer relationships support a wide economic moat.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our model assumes revenue CAGR ~5–6% through FY29 (reflecting 2025 guidance of 4–6% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=over%20year,quarter)) and consistent post-2025 demand). We forecast stable subscription growth and modest acceleration in commodity/indices data (fueled by ESG/energy trends). Operating margins are assumed to gradually expand as volume leverage and cost control improve: we project EBIT margins rising towards ~42% (pre-spin) by 2029. We use a WACC of ~8% (reflecting stable cash flows and moderate growth) and a terminal EBITDA multiple ~18×. Incorporating these, plus net debt from recent acquisitions, yields a fair value near **$620** per share. This corresponds to ~36× forward EPS in 2026 and ~15× EBITDA – levels justified by the strong fundamentals. Our implied EV/EBITDA is below historical peaks. The EPS bridge moves from $12.51 (2023 actual) to ~$17–18 by 2026, driven by top-line growth and operating leverage. Given the significant share repurchases (reducing share count ~2% annually), we have a slight boost to per-share results. Altogether, our analysis suggests the stock is somewhat undervalued (price/FVE ~0.86).  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key downside risks include macroeconomic and regulatory factors. A sharp economic slowdown or higher interest rates could reduce corporate activity and bond issuance, curtailing Ratings revenue. Moody’s explicitly cited U.S. trade policy uncertainty as a factor prompting slower issuance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/moodys-cuts-profit-forecast-market-volatility-after-solid-first-quarter-2025-04-22/#:~:text=solid%20quarter%2C%20Moody%27s%20reduced%20its,market%20trading)). Geopolitical events impacting capital markets (e.g. conflicts, sanctions) or material shifts in interest rates could similarly dampen data demand. On the regulatory front, S&P faces antitrust and benchmark oversight (e.g. the German probe into its fuel price reporting ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/germany-probes-argus-media-sp-global-over-fuel-market-pricing-concerns-2025-03-06/#:~:text=Germany%27s%20antitrust%20watchdog%20has%20initiated,The))). Any substantial fines or required business changes could hit earnings. Operationally, risks include cybersecurity/data breaches (given large data holdings), failures in acquisition integrations, or disruptions in proprietary data collection. ESG-related risks are moderate; regulatory focus on ratings and indices (MiFID II, benchmark regs) could impose compliance costs. Environmental/climate issues pose indirect risk (energy product demand), though S&P is also a provider of climate data. In sum, while S&P’s business is resilient, it is not recession-proof and is sensitive to external financial market conditions.  

### Capital Allocation  
S&P Global’s balance sheet remains strong. Net debt is modest (~$10–11 billion; cash ~$1.5 billion as of Q1 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%2C%20and%20restricted,))), given steady operating cash flow (~$3.7 b in 2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000071/spgi-20231231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20provided%20by%20operating%20activities,%28270%29))). The company has ample liquidity (revolver capacity) and low interest expense (guidance only ~$10 m higher annually). Capital allocation is shareholder-friendly. The Board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.96 (annual ~$3.84) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,million%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)) and plans to return ~85% of adjusted FCF (through dividends + repurchases) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,million%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)). Since 2024 it has authorized $650 m in ASRs ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=over%20year,guidance%20now%20calls%20for%20revenue)). Buybacks are disciplined (netting roughly 2% share-count reduction per year), and leverage remains prudent. M&A has been used sparingly (Sale of OSTTRA JV, Fincentric, PrimeOne) to focus on core business. Overall, capital allocation is rated **High**: the company consistently yields strong cash returns while maintaining a clean balance sheet.

### ESG Risk  
S&P Global’s Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating is 15.1 (Low Risk) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/s-p-global-inc/1007899965#:~:text=ESG%20Risk%20Rating)), placing it 62nd of 837 peers in Diversified Financials ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/s-p-global-inc/1007899965#:~:text=Company%20%20,139%20out%20of%20837)). By comparison, Moody’s scores slightly better (14.4, also Low) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/s-p-global-inc/1007899965#:~:text=Company%20%20,139%20out%20of%20837)). Material ESG issues include environmental governance of commodity benchmarks (regulatory oversight of Platts), social concerns in data centers and workforce, and governance (since ratings are under scrutiny, strong independence and ethics are vital). The company publishes ESG reports and has committed to net-zero operations, but faces pressure to strengthen climate data offerings. Overall ESG exposure is moderate given robust governance procedures.

### Analyst Note  
Goldman Sachs began 2025 on the upswing, with Q1 profit up 15% to $4.74B ($14.12/share), led by record equity trading revenue (up 27% to $4.2B) amid market volatility ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to%20%241.9%20billion%20due)). Investment banking fees slipped 8% to $1.9B as some clients delayed deals ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=billion%20%28%2414,markets%2C%20influenced%20by%20economic%20uncertainty)), but supervised assets hit a record $3.17T ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=ahead%2C%20despite%20strong%20client%20support,17%20trillion)). Management has raised credit reserves ($287M in Q1) against uncertain loan demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=ahead%2C%20despite%20strong%20client%20support,Compensation)). CEO David Solomon and other leaders cite a strong U.S. consumer and labor market as buffers to recession risk, even as they brace for Tariff-driven “noise” in M&A and capex ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-pares-risk-after-tariff-move-braces-more-uncertainty-2025-06-05/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20reduced%20its,turbulence%2C%20Waldron%20remains%20optimistic%20about)). Outside the U.S., Solomon has urged EU regulators to ease duplicative rules ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20CEO%20of%20Goldman,EU%27s%20overall%20economic%20and%20geopolitical)) to spur cross-border activity.  

Looking ahead, Goldman is aggressively repositioning into growth areas. Its new Capital Solutions franchise will target large-deal financing in the ~$2T private-credit market ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-planning-combine-three-groups-into-banking-markets-unit-wsj-2025-01-13/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20is%20forming%20a,Group%20will%20consolidate%20aspects%20of)). It has consolidated Asian investment banking into a single Asia-Pacific platform, which already shows rising ECM and M&A activity ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-leveraging-revamp-boost-asia-investment-banking-share-says-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20is%20undertaking%20a,and%20equity%20capital%20markets%20activity)). Asset & Wealth Management is also being expanded (e.g. launching active bond ETFs in Europe ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8a8462e1-529d-41f1-846b-390fd1846b74#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20Asset%20Management%20has,7bn%20in%202024))) while the firm raised its quarterly dividend and plans moderate buybacks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-robust-debt-underwriting-fixed-income-trading-2024-07-15/#:~:text=Goldman%20also%20signed%20a%20deal,with%20GM%20regarding%20credit%20cards)). CFO Denis Coleman and Chairman Solomon expect dealmaking to rebound in 2025, potentially above historical norms ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-sees-more-larger-scale-strategic-deals-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20anticipates%20an%20increase,of%20regulatory%20burdens%20following%20elections)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/goldman-ceo-says-dealmaking-could-surpass-10-year-averages-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20CEO%20David%20Solomon,It%20maker%20Kellanova%20and%20Mars)).  

Our updated thesis: Goldman’s IB and trading franchises remain best-in-class (it led EMEA advisory fees ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20leads%20in%20deal,headquarters%20for%20its%20international%20operations)) and ranks near the top in APAC deals ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-leveraging-revamp-boost-asia-investment-banking-share-says-2025-06-18/#:~:text=noticeable%20improvement%20in%20large,renewed%20investor%20engagement%20across%20Asia))). We project mid-single-digit revenue growth and modest margin improvement as markets normalize. The current share price (P/E ~8-9× our 2026 EPS forecast) trades below our $380 FVE. We see GS as a beneficiary of higher-for-longer rates and resumed corporate activity, but caution that elevated macro/regulatory risks (trade tensions, fiscal deficits) justify a Defensive stance near-term.  

### Business Description  
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a global investment banking and financial services firm. It operates through major segments: **Investment Banking** (M&A advisory, equity and debt underwriting), **Global Markets** (equities and FICC sales & trading), **Asset & Wealth Management** (institutional asset management and private wealth services), and **Consumer & Commercial Banking** (digital consumer finance products, e.g. credit cards) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to%20%241.9%20billion%20due)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-apple-card-partnership-may-end-before-2030-2025-01-15/#:~:text=earnings%20call%20that%20there%20is,million)). Headquartered in New York, Goldman serves a wide client base (corporations, governments, institutions, affluent individuals) on five continents. Notably, Goldman led all firms in Europe/Middle East in M&A advisory and is a top-three global IB firm ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20leads%20in%20deal,headquarters%20for%20its%20international%20operations)). It has ~46,500 employees (as of end-2024) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-surges-investment-banking-trading-fuel-bumper-quarter-2025-01-15/#:~:text=down%20its%20consumer%20banking%20sector,in%20Q4)).  

Goldman’s investment banking franchises have historically been market leaders. For example, in 2024 it advised on mega-deals (e.g. Kellanova/Mars) and executed the largest U.S. IPOs. The firm’s international reach is anchored by its London office (the largest outside the U.S.) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20leads%20in%20deal,headquarters%20for%20its%20international%20operations)), along with major hubs in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and elsewhere. In recent years the bank refocused on core businesses: it has exited or wound down troubled consumer ventures (e.g. discussing ending its Apple Card credit partnership ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-apple-card-partnership-may-end-before-2030-2025-01-15/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%27%20partnership%20with%20Apple,million)) and exiting its GM credit-card joint venture ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-trading-revenue-is-heading-10-slide-3q-2024-09-09/#:~:text=2025,million%20in%20revenues%20this%20quarter))) and does not pursue unsecured consumer loans. These shifts have led Goldman to “refocus…on traditional investment banking and trading” after a failed consumer push ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-robust-debt-underwriting-fixed-income-trading-2024-07-15/#:~:text=which%20saw%20the%20highest%20earnings,and%20asset%20and%20wealth%20management)), doubling down on advisory and markets revenue growth.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Goldman’s strategic playbook centers on leveraging global market cycles and technology, while addressing regulatory and competitive challenges. Recently it has reorganized and expanded to capture secular trends: for example, it formed a new “Capital Solutions” division to finance large corporate and sponsor transactions, tapping the private credit sector ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-planning-combine-three-groups-into-banking-markets-unit-wsj-2025-01-13/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20is%20forming%20a,Group%20will%20consolidate%20aspects%20of)). It also consolidated its Asia-Pacific banking operations (merging its regional advisory teams into one unit) as momentum in Asian IPO and M&A markets recovered ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-leveraging-revamp-boost-asia-investment-banking-share-says-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20is%20undertaking%20a,and%20equity%20capital%20markets%20activity)). On the product side, GS is innovating in asset and wealth management (e.g. launching active fixed-income ETFs in Europe ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8a8462e1-529d-41f1-846b-390fd1846b74#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20Asset%20Management%20has,7bn%20in%202024))) and digital investment platforms, aiming to boost fee income. At the same time, it has raised its quarterly dividend and plans controlled share buybacks (while keeping a high Tier-1 capital buffer).  

Management projects a pickup in deal activity in 2025. CFO Denis Coleman and others note that pent-up corporate needs and a pro-growth policy environment could drive a rise in large mergers and equity issuances ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-sees-more-larger-scale-strategic-deals-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20anticipates%20an%20increase,of%20regulatory%20burdens%20following%20elections)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/goldman-ceo-says-dealmaking-could-surpass-10-year-averages-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20CEO%20David%20Solomon,It%20maker%20Kellanova%20and%20Mars)). Solomon’s leadership shifts align with this outlook: he has built relationships with U.S. policymakers, and lobbied for regulatory reforms abroad (criticizing EU rules as overly complex ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20CEO%20of%20Goldman,of%20ineffective%20structures%20to%20promote))).  

Medium-term, we assume Goldman sustains a competitive edge via its unmatched client network and diversified capabilities. We forecast mid-to-high single-digit revenue CAGRs through 2025-29, with operating margins gradually improving (as trading normalizes but fixed costs remain high). However, these projections hinge on still-uncertain macro trends (global growth, rates) and the bank’s ability to adapt to new capital requirements. Strategic investments in data and technology should support efficiency, but execution will be key.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
1. **Bulls** contend that Goldman’s stock is undervalued given its cyclical strength.  They argue the Q1 trading boom is proof that GS can grow earnings rapidly when markets are volatile ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to%20%241.9%20billion%20due)). Its standing in global investment banking (leading EMEA deal fees ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20leads%20in%20deal,headquarters%20for%20its%20international%20operations)), top ranks in APAC deals ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-leveraging-revamp-boost-asia-investment-banking-share-says-2025-06-18/#:~:text=noticeable%20improvement%20in%20large,renewed%20investor%20engagement%20across%20Asia))) means it wins most of the large fees when activity picks up. New growth initiatives (Capital Solutions, active ETFs, wealth mgmt platforms) will diversify revenue and justify higher multiples. Proponents note Goldman's strong capital base (CET1 ~13%) and shareholder returns: the firm recently repurchased shares and upped its dividend ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-robust-debt-underwriting-fixed-income-trading-2024-07-15/#:~:text=Goldman%20also%20signed%20a%20deal,with%20GM%20regarding%20credit%20cards)). Finally, industry analysts see US economic growth and Fed ease encouraging more corporate financing and M&A ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-sees-more-larger-scale-strategic-deals-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20anticipates%20an%20increase,of%20regulatory%20burdens%20following%20elections)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/goldman-ceo-says-dealmaking-could-surpass-10-year-averages-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20CEO%20David%20Solomon,It%20maker%20Kellanova%20and%20Mars)).  

2. **Bears** point out the cyclicality, regulation, and execution risks. They note that “bad news” such as President Trump's tariffs could dampen growth: Goldman executives explicitly warn of slower capex, M&A, and buybacks under new tariff policy ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-pares-risk-after-tariff-move-braces-more-uncertainty-2025-06-05/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20reduced%20its,turbulence%2C%20Waldron%20remains%20optimistic%20about)). Consumer finance setbacks (Apple/GM credit card losses) have already trimmed ROE by ~75-100bp ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-apple-card-partnership-may-end-before-2030-2025-01-15/#:~:text=earnings%20call%20that%20there%20is,million)). Executive compensation is also a flashpoint: recent retention bonuses (e.g. $80M to Solomon and Waldron) drew criticism and leave fewer dollars for buybacks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Goldman%20set%20aside%20%24287,With%20limited%20hiring)). Moreover, GS’s returns on equity remain moderate (~11% in Q2 2024 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/cc0e189f-8f2d-4d20-ab64-86454dfd1573#:~:text=increase%20in%20investment%20banking%20revenues,Despite%20challenges%2C%20Goldman))) as higher capital and operating costs drag on profits. Bears caution that these factors – along with possible credit normalization and stiff competition in banking – could pressure near-term earnings and keep the stock near current levels.  

### Economic Moat  
Goldman’s advantages stem from its scale, client network and brand. It consistently ranks at or near the top in global investment banking and trading — for instance, Goldman led EMEA advisory fees and is a top issuer globally ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20leads%20in%20deal,headquarters%20for%20its%20international%20operations)), and it recently led APAC equity issuances ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-leveraging-revamp-boost-asia-investment-banking-share-says-2025-06-18/#:~:text=marked%20by%20U,renewed%20investor%20engagement%20across%20Asia)). Its diversified product lines (from IPOs to asset management to corporate lending) create cross-selling opportunities and data synergies. These strengths suggest a **Narrow moat**: Goldman is a dominant or near-dominant player in several niches, benefiting from network effects (firms use Goldman to reach global markets).  

However, the moat is limited. Banking is fiercely competitive and subject to intense capital regulation; Goldman has no protected technology or resource barrier. Profitability is cyclical and sensitive to market swings. Its historical ROEs (e.g. ~11% recently ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/cc0e189f-8f2d-4d20-ab64-86454dfd1573#:~:text=increase%20in%20investment%20banking%20revenues,Despite%20challenges%2C%20Goldman))) are well below the 20%+ ideal for a “wide moat”. In addition, rivals (JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, etc.) have similar scale. Therefore, we believe Goldman’s franchise advantage is real but not indestructible — consistent with a **narrow economic moat** assessment.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our valuation model assumes Goldman generates mid-single-digit revenue growth (CAGR ~5% through 2029) and gradually improving margins, as trading returns normalize and efficiency initiatives take hold. Key profit drivers are equity trading (sensitive to market volatility), fixed-income trading (linked to yield curves), and investment banking fees (tied to M&A and capital markets activity). For example, we assume equities LTM revenue can ebb and flow 20–30% around its cyclical peak, while IB fees grow with the investment banking backlog (which recently showed sequential gains).  

We project operating margins rising from mid-20% toward 30% by 2029 as fixed costs are leveraged. We apply an 8.5% WACC (≈risk-free + equity risk premium) and 2.0% terminal growth. Under these assumptions, our discounted-cash-flow yields a per-share fair value of ~$380 (as of mid-2025), implying a P/E in the high-single digits on our 2026 EPS. Our estimate corresponds to about 1.3× likely 2026 tangible book value, reflecting moderate cyclicality. By comparison, peers trade at P/B near 1× under similar assumptions. Key sensitivities include trading volumes (adversely affected by stability or lower volatility) and any material shifts in Fed policy (affecting funding costs).  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
We rate Goldman’s uncertainty as **High**, reflecting macro, regulatory and execution risks. Macroeconomic factors loom large: we heed Goldman’s own caution about U.S. tariffs, fiscal deficits and rising global interest rates potentially slowing credit demand and dealmaking ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-pares-risk-after-tariff-move-braces-more-uncertainty-2025-06-05/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20reduced%20its,turbulence%2C%20Waldron%20remains%20optimistic%20about)). A renewed market downturn could quickly reverse trading revenue, as GS’s latest-chairman comment on trading declines showed ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-trading-revenue-is-heading-10-slide-3q-2024-09-09/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%27%20trading%20revenue%20is,Solomon%20is)). On the regulatory front, tighter bank capital rules (Basel III endgame), or higher stress-buffer requirements, could constrain lending and return on equity; Solomon has lobbied to ease EU rules ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/goldman-ceo-urges-europe-review-overbearing-regulations-french-opinion-piece-2025-06-24/#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20CEO%20of%20Goldman,and%20other%20major)). Goldman’s exposure to volatile sectors (e.g. tech IPOs, cryptocurrency — Solomon noted regulatory constraints on crypto trading ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/goldman-ceo-says-dealmaking-could-surpass-10-year-averages-2025-2024-12-10/#:~:text=CFO%20Denis%20Coleman%20also%20anticipates,contingent%20on%20the%20board%27s%20decision))) adds uncertainty. Operationally, execution of new strategies (Asia reorg, private credit rollout) may face teething problems. Lastly, military or policy shocks (e.g. geopolitical conflict) could disrupt markets. Short-term stock volatility tends to be high, as even management communications and U.S. political developments have triggered stock swings in 2024–25.  

### Capital Allocation  
Goldman’s balance sheet is conservatively managed: CET1 equity ran comfortably above 12% through 2025. The firm returns capital via dividends and share repurchases, but its track record is mixed. In mid-2024 it repurchased several billion in stock and raised its quarterly dividend by ~9% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-robust-debt-underwriting-fixed-income-trading-2024-07-15/#:~:text=Goldman%20also%20signed%20a%20deal,with%20GM%20regarding%20credit%20cards)), reflecting strong capital generation. However, executives’ compensation is very high (in Q1 2025 Solomon and Waldron each received $80M retention bonuses ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Goldman%20set%20aside%20%24287,With%20limited%20hiring))), and buybacks have generally been moderate by historical standards. GS also took charges to wind down consumer lending (e.g. ~$400M impact in 2024) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-ceo-says-trading-revenue-is-heading-10-slide-3q-2024-09-09/#:~:text=2025,investment%20banking%20fees%20in%20the)), demonstrating discipline but also signaling limits to redeploying capital. Goldman invests selectively in new business lines (e.g. private credit funds, technology platforms), but it has not made large acquisitions. Overall, we rate Goldman’s capital allocation as **Poor** (2/5): the firm consistently maintains excess capital (a sign of caution), gives modest returns to shareholders (relative to peers), and suffers from heavy top executive pay.

### ESG Risk  
Goldman’s ESG profile reflects its exposure as a major financier and asset manager. Sustainalytics would likely rate it **High Risk** (score ~25) given material issues in climate, social, and governance areas. On climate, Goldman has retreated from major industry initiatives (it left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in Dec 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/goldman-sachs-quits-global-climate-coalition-banks-2024-12-06/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20withdrawn%20from,The%20firm)) and exited the Climate Action 100+ coalition in mid-2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-asset-management-leave-ca100-investor-group-2024-08-09/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%27%20fund%20division%20has,Vert%20Asset%20Management%2C%20Mellon%20Investment))), citing regulatory backlash. Nonetheless, it maintains net-zero lending commitments and reports emissions from its financing. Critics highlight Goldman’s substantial lending to fossil-fuel sectors and limited transparency on climate impact. On social factors, GS faces scrutiny over data privacy and workforce diversity (some employee groups have urged better mix in hiring). Governance issues include the outsized pay packages for executives ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Goldman%20set%20aside%20%24287,With%20limited%20hiring)) and periodic boardroom debates (CEO David Solomon’s role, succession planning). Compared to peers (JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, etc.), Goldman’s ESG scores are roughly in line with large U.S. banks – none are rated “low risk” by Sustainalytics. For perspective, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley also fall in the medium-high risk band due to similar exposures. GS ranks in the bottom half of its peer group in recent MSCI ESG ratings as well. Key risk factors for Goldman include: **Climate policy** (financial-sector regulation of emissions, physical risk to loan portfolios), **Governance** (shareholder disputes over compensation, campaign finance), and **Social** (fair lending and wealth inequality scrutiny).

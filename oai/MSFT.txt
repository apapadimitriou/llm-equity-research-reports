### Analyst Note  
Microsoft posted robust fiscal Q3 2025 results, underscoring strong cloud momentum. Revenue in the March quarter rose 13% year-over-year to $70.1 billion, with net income up 18% to $25.8 billion (EPS $3.46) – well ahead of consensus ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=performance%20with%20an%2018,Microsoft%27s%20robust%20cloud%20computing%20and)). Azure’s revenue grew 33% (vs. ~30% expected) amid surging demand for AI services ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=Microsoft%20reported%20stronger,to)). Management projected 34–35% Azure growth for Q4, sending shares up ~7% after earnings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=in%20the%20third%20quarter%20ending,new%20Azure%20contract%20with%20OpenAI)). Year-to-date, Microsoft’s stock has climbed on investor enthusiasm for generative AI initiatives and resilient cloud growth. At ~$464, shares trade around 0.95× our $490 intrinsic value estimate, a sharp reversal from the ~21% discount earlier in 2025 ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Fair%20Value%20Estimate%3A%20%24490)). We believe the market is now pricing in much of Microsoft’s near-term AI uplift and operational outperformance.  

Our long-term thesis remains positive. Microsoft’s wide-moat businesses – spanning productivity software, cloud infrastructure, and gaming – are capitalizing on secular tailwinds in digital transformation and AI. The company continues to integrate OpenAI’s models across its product suite (e.g. Copilot AI in Office 365) to drive user productivity ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=The%20growth%20was%20largely%20driven,productivity%2C%20cut%20costs%2C%20and%20grow)), which should support pricing power and customer retention. The successful completion of the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in late 2023 broadened Microsoft’s gaming content portfolio and subscription reach ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#:~:text=,October%2013%2C%202023)), reinforcing its ecosystem in the personal computing segment. Given sustained double-digit growth in cloud and franchise software, we forecast a 13% revenue CAGR through 2029 ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=model%20a%20five,the%20model%20transition%20to%20subscriptions)) with modest margin expansion. While macroeconomic and geopolitical risks (e.g. tariff headwinds from renewed U.S.–China trade tensions) persist ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=services%2C%20also%20saw%20a%206,wide%20instability%20and%20economic%20challenges)), Microsoft’s diversified revenue, strong cash generation, and disciplined management leave it well positioned. We maintain our Medium uncertainty rating. The stock now appears fairly valued; we would await a larger margin of safety before recommending adding exposure at current levels.

### Business Description  
Microsoft develops and licenses software, services, devices, and solutions globally. Founded in 1975 and headquartered in Redmond, WA, the company’s core segments are: **Productivity and Business Processes** (Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn), **Intelligent Cloud** (Azure public cloud, Windows Server, SQL Server, GitHub), and **More Personal Computing** (Windows OS, Surface devices, Xbox gaming, search and advertising) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/microsoft-corp/1007900081#:~:text=processes%20%28legacy%20Microsoft%20Office%2C%20cloud,Surface%20laptops%2C%20tablets%2C%20and%20desktops)). Microsoft generates over half of revenue from cloud and software subscription services, selling primarily to enterprises and government, with notable consumer exposure through Windows, Xbox content, and Office consumer subscriptions. The firm operates worldwide; the U.S. accounted for ~51% of revenue in FY2024 (with significant sales in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and other regions) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=The%20growth%20was%20largely%20driven,productivity%2C%20cut%20costs%2C%20and%20grow)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=Microsoft%27s%20personal%20computing%20division%2C%20which,wide%20instability%20and%20economic%20challenges)). Microsoft is the world’s second-largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, and one of only two U.S. companies with an AAA credit rating ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#:~:text=Company,as%20world%27s%20most%20valuable%20public)). As of 2024, it employs roughly 220,000 people globally ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/microsoft-corp/1007900081#:~:text=processes%20%28legacy%20Microsoft%20Office%2C%20cloud,Surface%20laptops%2C%20tablets%2C%20and%20desktops)).

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy since 2014 has transformed Microsoft into a cloud- and AI-focused leader ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=Morningstar%20analyst%20Dan%20Romanoff%20Says%3A)). The firm offers a vertically integrated stack of technology: from foundational infrastructure (Azure’s IaaS and PaaS offerings) to software platforms (Windows, Office) and now content (gaming and LinkedIn). This breadth creates a network effect across Microsoft’s ecosystem, driving cross-selling and user engagement. For example, Office 365 and Dynamics tie into Azure’s cloud services, and Xbox Game Pass leverages Azure streaming infrastructure. The 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard adds best-selling game franchises (e.g. Call of Duty) to bolster Microsoft’s Xbox and cloud gaming strategy ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#:~:text=,October%2013%2C%202023)). Management is pushing further into subscriptions and cloud delivery – e.g. shifting traditional on-premises Office and ERP customers onto cloud-based Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 – to lock in recurring revenue and higher lifetime customer value ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=is%20already%20an%20approximately%20%2475,Platform%2C%20with%20these%20moves%20now)). 

Microsoft’s medium-term outlook is underpinned by secular growth trends in enterprise IT spending. Cloud computing continues to grow rapidly as organizations migrate workloads; Azure revenue jumped 33% in the latest quarter ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=Microsoft%20reported%20stronger,to)) and management guidance suggests growth will remain above 30% in the near term ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=in%20the%20third%20quarter%20ending,200%20billion%20to%20its%20market)). The explosion of interest in generative AI is another catalyst: Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI allows it to embed advanced AI models into Azure and applications. Early signs show this is boosting cloud usage and enabling premium pricing – Azure OpenAI usage contributed to the 18% bookings increase last quarter ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=forecast%20of%2034%25,new%20Azure%20contract%20with%20OpenAI)). We expect Microsoft to sustain low-teens aggregate revenue growth over the next five years, driven by Azure (estimated ~$75 billion annual revenue in FY2025, up ~30% ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=is%20already%20an%20approximately%20%2475,Platform%2C%20with%20these%20moves%20now))) and steady gains in Office 365 ARPU through upselling security and AI features ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Microsoft%20365%20benefits%20from,over%20the%20next%20several%20years)). The Personal Computing segment is a modest grower (mid-single-digit%) as Windows stabilizes with the PC market and gaming expands via content and subscription services. Overall, Microsoft’s broad innovation pipeline and cloud-centric strategy should support mid-teens top-line growth and resilient profitability, despite periodic macro or competitive challenges.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  

**Bulls Say:**  
1. Microsoft Azure is a leading public cloud platform, poised to benefit as enterprises continue migrating IT infrastructure to hybrid and fully cloud environments ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=,to%20help%20drive%20Azure%20growth)).  
2. Office 365 and Dynamics 365 have significant upsell potential – customers are adopting higher-tier subscriptions (for added security, Teams voice, AI features) and driving sustained growth in productivity software revenue ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Microsoft%20365%20benefits%20from,over%20the%20next%20several%20years)).  
3. Microsoft maintains monopoly-like positions in PC operating systems (Windows) and productivity software (Office) that generate enormous cash flows, which management can reinvest into high-growth areas like Azure and AI ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=pressure,to%20help%20drive%20Azure%20growth)).  

**Bears Say:**  
1. The enterprise shift from licensed software to subscriptions is maturing; Microsoft’s Office growth is slowing as most users have already moved to Office 365, a now-mature product category ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=,growth%2C%20notably%20Azure%20and%20Dynamics)).  
2. Microsoft lacks a meaningful presence in mobile operating systems and hardware – a strategic weakness given the importance of mobile platforms (it abandoned Windows Phone and relies on iOS/Android for mobile Office apps) ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=,growth%2C%20notably%20Azure%20and%20Dynamics)).  
3. In key growth areas Microsoft is a strong player but not the leader: Azure remains second in cloud market share behind AWS, and Dynamics trails competitors like Salesforce in CRM ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=,growth%2C%20notably%20Azure%20and%20Dynamics)). These competitive gaps could limit Microsoft’s growth or pricing power in those markets.

### Economic Moat  
We concur with Morningstar’s **Wide** moat rating for Microsoft, reflecting multiple durable competitive advantages ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=Microsoft%20MSFT%20may%20very%20well,done%20an%20outstanding%20job%20of)). First, Microsoft enjoys significant **switching costs**: enterprises deeply embedded in Windows, Office, and Azure face high friction to migrate to alternative platforms. Mission-critical productivity software (Office 365, Teams) and cloud services get integrated into workflows, making customers reluctant to switch – evidenced by Office’s monopolistic ~85% share in office productivity software ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/stocks/217052/bulls-v-bears-is-microsoft-a-buy#:~:text=pressure,to%20help%20drive%20Azure%20growth)). Second, Microsoft benefits from **network effects**. The more users and developers on Microsoft’s platforms, the more valuable the platforms become – for instance, Windows’ large installed base attracts application developers, and GitHub/Azure’s developer communities reinforce Azure’s appeal. Third, Microsoft leverages a **cost advantage** in cloud infrastructure. As one of the largest cloud providers, Azure can spread R&D and data center costs across a huge global customer base, allowing aggressive investment in new capacity and AI hardware. In the March-quarter, Microsoft’s capital expenditures surged 53% to $21.4 billion as it built out AI data centers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=value.%20Commercial%20bookings%20grew%2018,lived%20assets%20like%20chips)) – spending smaller competitors cannot easily match. These factors give Microsoft formidable pricing power and the ability to earn returns on invested capital well above its cost of capital. We expect Microsoft will continue generating excess returns for at least the next two decades, underpinned by its entrenched enterprise footprint, platform ecosystem, and scale.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
We peg Microsoft’s **fair value** at $490 per share. This equates to about 38× our FY2025 EPS estimate and an enterprise value/sales multiple of ~13× ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=Fair%20Value%20Estimate%20for%20Microsoft,Stock)), which we view as justified by Microsoft’s high margins and strong growth outlook. Key model assumptions include a 5-year revenue CAGR of ~13% (FY2024–29) ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=model%20a%20five,the%20model%20transition%20to%20subscriptions)). We project FY2025 revenue around $282 billion, up ~15% year-on-year, reflecting ongoing Azure strength (30%+ growth) and incorporation of Activision Blizzard’s gaming revenue. Thereafter, we model annual revenue growth moderating to low-teens as the law of large numbers sets in. By FY2029 we forecast revenue approaching $445 billion. On profitability, Microsoft’s operating margin was ~45% in FY2024 ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=term,an%20accounting%20change%2C%20Activision%20pressure)), a peak boosted by operating leverage and a favorable sales mix. We expect a temporary dip in FY2025 margins due to an accounting change and Activision integration costs ([www.morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/mobile/Article.aspx?Site=uk&articleid=263889#:~:text=term,an%20accounting%20change%2C%20Activision%20pressure)), but foresee margins recovering and reaching ~46% by FY2029 as Azure scales and efficiency improves. Our EPS estimates rise from about $13.4 in FY2025 to ~$20 by FY2029, implying a 10%+ EPS CAGR. We use a weighted average cost of capital around 8%, reflecting Microsoft’s AAA credit rating and the low equity risk of its entrenched, cash-rich businesses ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#:~:text=Company,as%20world%27s%20most%20valuable%20public)). At a $490 fair value, Microsoft’s forward P/E (~29× FY2026E) and EV/EBITDA multiples are in line with peers in the cloud and software industry. We view this as reasonable given Microsoft’s superior competitive positioning and growth prospects.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Microsoft faces a **Medium** uncertainty outlook. Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks are noteworthy – for example, renewed trade tensions under the current U.S. administration have introduced tariff uncertainties that weighed on tech stocks ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=services%2C%20also%20saw%20a%206,wide%20instability%20and%20economic%20challenges)). A deterioration in global economic conditions or international relations (especially involving China, a key market and supply source) could dampen Microsoft’s results via softer IT spending or restricted market access. **Regulatory** risk is also elevated. Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and EU have scrutinized Microsoft’s market power and bundling practices. In Europe, the company had to unbundle Teams from Office 365 after a formal EU investigation into whether tying Teams with Office unfairly harmed competitors ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-take-more-steps-resolve-eu-concerns-about-teams-smith-says-2024-06-04/#:~:text=Microsoft%20plans%20to%20take%20further,was%20prepared%20for%20additional%20measures)). Compliance remedies (or potential fines) could create friction or set precedents limiting Microsoft’s product integration – a core competitive strategy. Additionally, Microsoft’s aggressive push into AI and cloud services raises **data privacy and security** concerns. Any serious cybersecurity breaches or misuse of data (e.g. via AI systems) could invite regulatory actions or reputational damage. On the **competitive** front, Microsoft contends with formidable rivals across segments – from Amazon and Google in cloud, to Zoom and Slack in collaboration, to Sony and Nintendo in gaming. An inability to keep pace on technology (such as AI model quality or cloud price-performance) or major shifts in tech paradigms (e.g. a post-smartphone platform where Microsoft lacks presence) could erode its long-term moat. Finally, large acquisitions like Activision carry **integration risk**; challenges in merging cultures or systems could dilute anticipated synergies. Despite these risks, Microsoft’s broad diversification and financial resilience temper the overall uncertainty to a moderate level.

### Capital Allocation  
We assign Microsoft an **Exemplary** capital allocation rating. The company’s financial position is exceptionally strong – as of late 2024, Microsoft held over $75 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2024-09-17/microsoft-sube-un-10-el-dividendo-y-apueba-recomprar-acciones-por-60000-millones-de-dolares.html#:~:text=previa%20del%20mismo%20monto%20anunciada,en%20los%20%C3%BAltimos%2012%20meses)), giving it ample flexibility to invest in growth and return cash to shareholders. Management has balanced these priorities well. On the investment side, Microsoft has aggressively invested in strategic areas like cloud infrastructure and AI. Capital expenditures jumped ~78% year-on-year in the June 2024 quarter ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-approves-new-60-billion-share-buyback-2024-09-16/#:~:text=Microsoft%20announced%20a%20new%20%2460,for%20the%20quarter%20ending%20June)), reflecting heavy spending on data centers and chips to support Azure and AI workloads. Importantly, these investments are yielding results in the form of high growth and technological leadership in cloud/AI – evidence of prudent reinvestment. At the same time, Microsoft continues to return substantial cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In September 2024, the board authorized a new $60 billion share repurchase program and raised the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.83 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-approves-new-60-billion-share-buyback-2024-09-16/#:~:text=Microsoft%20announced%20a%20new%20%2460,for%20the%20quarter%20ending%20June)). Microsoft’s dividend has grown annually for 19 years, and share buybacks have steadily reduced the share count, indicating a commitment to shareholder value. The company also generally avoids overpriced or value-destructive acquisitions. The $69 billion Activision deal is large, but it targets a gaming sector Microsoft knows well and offers long-term strategic benefit (content library and user base) – and Microsoft has the financial strength to absorb it without straining its credit. Management’s discipline is further evidenced by Microsoft retaining its AAA credit rating ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#:~:text=Company,as%20world%27s%20most%20valuable%20public)), a rarity. Overall, CEO Satya Nadella and the leadership team have demonstrated excellent stewardship of capital: funding innovation and growth initiatives, maintaining a fortress balance sheet, and returning excess cash, all without compromising the company’s competitive positioning.

### ESG Risk  
Microsoft’s overall **ESG Risk Rating** is assessed as *Medium*. Morningstar Sustainalytics assigns Microsoft an ESG risk score in the mid-20s (on a scale where lower is better) – this places Microsoft around the 82nd percentile in the Software & Services industry (ranked roughly 166th out of 947 companies by risk) ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/microsoft-corp/1007900081#:~:text=Microsoft%20Corp,date%20indicates%20when%20a%20company)). In Sustainalytics’ framework, Microsoft’s risk exposure is moderate and management of these issues is strong, resulting in a middling risk residual. By comparison, key software peers SAP and Oracle receive *Low* risk ratings with scores of 13 and 14.6, respectively ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/microsoft-corp/1007900081#:~:text=Company%20%20,66%20out%20of%20947)), reflecting their narrower product scopes and fewer major controversies. Microsoft’s higher risk stems partly from its history of regulatory and social challenges – for example, past antitrust disputes, privacy concerns related to its software and cloud services, and workforce issues (such as prior allegations of workplace harassment or discrimination). **Material ESG issues (MEIs)** for Microsoft include Data Privacy & Security, Business Ethics, and Human Capital. The company handles vast amounts of customer data via Windows, Azure, and LinkedIn, so data protection practices are critical. Microsoft has invested heavily in cybersecurity and compliance, but any lapse (e.g. a breach or misuse of data) could significantly impact stakeholder trust. On business ethics, Microsoft has generally improved since its 2000s antitrust battles, though regulators still monitor its market behavior (e.g. EU scrutiny of Teams bundling ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-take-more-steps-resolve-eu-concerns-about-teams-smith-says-2024-06-04/#:~:text=antitrust%20concerns%20regarding%20its%20chat,for%20additional%20measures%20if%20needed))). In social responsibility, Microsoft scores well on many aspects (e.g. carbon neutrality commitments, philanthropy) but faces scrutiny on issues like content moderation (through LinkedIn, Xbox) and responsible AI deployment. Overall, Microsoft’s ESG risk profile is better than the sector average but not as low as some peers’, due to its broad footprint and past controversies. The company currently carries a **“Significant” controversy level** (Category 3 out of 5) on Sustainalytics, indicating some ongoing public incidents, though none are deemed severe ([au.finance.yahoo.com](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/sustainability/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Corporation%20,Last%20updated%20on%209%2F2023)). Continued focus on cybersecurity, ethical AI, and compliance should help Microsoft further mitigate ESG risks.

### Appendix  

**Key Valuation Assumptions:** Our $490/share fair value is derived from a 10-year DCF model. Key inputs include a normalized revenue growth of ~13% for FY2025–29 (tapering to ~7% by FY2033), a long-term EBIT margin of ~46%, a 8.0% WACC, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate. These assumptions reflect Microsoft’s robust growth in cloud & AI tempered by its massive scale. We assume the Activision acquisition contributes ~3% of incremental revenue growth in FY2025–26 and modest margin dilution of ~100 bps in FY2025. We also factor in ~$20 billion per year of share buybacks, reducing shares outstanding by ~1% annually. Our fair value implies forward EV/EBIT ~25× and EV/Revenue ~10×, which are high but supported by Microsoft’s exceptional profitability and competitive moat.  

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- **Economic Moat:** A structural business advantage that is expected to fend off competitors and generate excess returns on capital. Morningstar assigns *Wide* moats to firms likely to sustain high returns for 20+ years, *Narrow* for ~10 years, and *None* for little to no durable advantage. Microsoft’s wide moat stems from its entrenched ecosystem, high switching costs, and economies of scale.  
- **Uncertainty Rating:** Morningstar’s estimate of the predictability of a company’s future cash flows. *Low* uncertainty firms have very stable demand and earnings (warranting a smaller margin of safety), whereas *High* or *Very High* uncertainty firms face more volatility or disruption risk. Microsoft’s Medium uncertainty reflects moderately predictable cash flows with some exposure to economic cycles and tech disruption.  
- **Capital Allocation Rating:** An evaluation of management’s use of shareholder capital, including investment discipline, balance sheet management, and dividend/buyback policy. *Exemplary* means management consistently executes value-accretive investments and prudent capital returns, *Standard* is average stewardship, and *Poor* indicates a history of value-destructive decisions. Microsoft’s Exemplary rating is supported by its successful investments in cloud/AI and substantial cash returns without compromising growth or financial health.

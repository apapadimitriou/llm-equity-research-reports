### Analyst Note  
Wells Fargo’s first-quarter 2025 results showed continued strength in non-interest businesses while grappling with margin pressures. Net income rose 6% year-over-year to $4.89 billion ($1.39/share) on lower provisions and cost cuts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20reported%20a%206,to)), and investment banking fees jumped 24% on strong deal flows ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=%2413,roles%20in%20major%20deals%20like)). However, net interest income (NII) fell 6% to $11.50 billion amid rate cuts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=growth%2C%20creating%20an%20uncertain%20outlook,orders%20closed%20in%202025%20and)). CEO Charlie Scharf cautioned that tariffs might slow U.S. growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Blackstone%E2%80%99s%20acquisition%20of%20Safe%20Harbor,dip%20in%20net)). Crucially, in early June the Fed lifted Wells Fargo’s $1.95 trillion asset cap ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=After%20seven%20years%2C%20the%20Federal,by%20the%20Fed%2C%20made%20unanimously)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/view-wells-fargo-asset-cap-lifted-allowing-bank-grow-2025-06-03/#:~:text=The%20U,such%20as%20commercial%20deposits%2C%20trading)), allowing the bank to pursue growth in credit cards, wealth, commercial banking and dealmaking ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=most%20regulatory%20restrictions%20lifted%2C%20the,He%20emphasized%20a%20cultural%20transformation)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=responded%20positively%2C%20with%20shares%20rising,the%20cap%27s%20removal%20signifies%20a)). Under Scharf’s turnaround since 2019, Wells has cut over 55,000 jobs and restructured compliance systems ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=Reserve%20lifted%20a%20major%20%241,With)). Bulls point to the cap removal as a game-changer for expansion, and analysts now forecast roughly 20% annual EPS growth during 2026–28 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-shares-rise-after-fed-ends-growth-freeze-2025-06-04/#:~:text=constrained%20period%2C%20the%20bank%20now,annually%20between%202026%20and%202028)). Bears counter that muted consumer loan demand and high deposit costs will continue to pressure margins ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-says-consumer-loan-growth-stay-muted-or-drop-this-year-2025-06-10/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer%2C,95%20trillion%20asset%20cap%20that)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-falls-deposit-costs-2024-07-12/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20second,Net%20income)). Our updated model reflects mid-single-digit revenue growth with improving expense efficiency; the resulting fair value is about $85 per share. This modest premium to current levels factors in catalyst events (cap removal, buybacks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=focused%20on%20accountability%20and%20meritocracy,dividends%20to%20boost%20investor%20confidence)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-buy-back-up-40-bln-its-common-stock-2025-04-29/#:~:text=On%20April%2029%2C%202025%2C%20Wells,The%20move%20signals%20the%20financial))) and assumes a 9–10% discount rate.  

### Business Description  
Wells Fargo (WFC) is a diversified U.S. bank operating primarily domestically ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/wells-fargo-co/1008171137#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20is%20one%20of,entirely%20focused%20on%20the%20US)). Its core segments are: Consumer Banking & Lending (retail checking and savings, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards); Commercial Banking (loans and cash management for businesses); Corporate & Investment Banking (capital markets, advisory, trading); and Wealth & Investment Management (brokerage, asset management, private bank). The bank holds roughly $1.9 trillion in assets ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/wells-fargo-co/1008171137#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20is%20one%20of,entirely%20focused%20on%20the%20US)) and maintains an extensive branch network. It funds lending largely with deposits and services a broad retail and commercial customer base.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Wells Fargo’s competitive edge has traditionally been scale and customer breadth, though its franchise was weakened by past scandals. Under CEO Scharf, the strategy has shifted from restructuring to growth. The bank is focusing on expanding higher-return businesses. For example, it aims to quickly scale its credit card and merchant services and boost investment banking and wealth-management capabilities ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=most%20regulatory%20restrictions%20lifted%2C%20the,He%20emphasized%20a%20cultural%20transformation)). The recent lifting of the regulator’s $1.95 trillion asset cap ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=After%20seven%20years%2C%20the%20Federal,by%20the%20Fed%2C%20made%20unanimously)) now permits calibrated balance-sheet growth; competitors like JPMorgan and BofA grew 4–5% CAGR over Wells’ seven-year cap period ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-shares-rise-after-fed-ends-growth-freeze-2025-06-04/#:~:text=significant%20victory%20with%20this%20decision,Analysts%20project%20gradual%2C%20linear)). Digital banking investment and cost controls also remain priorities, as Wells has trimmed expenses 12–15% in recent years ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=cutting%20and%20reduced%20provisions%20for,due%20to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargos-profit-falls-lower-interest-income-2024-10-11/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20reported%20a%20higher,Despite%20this%2C%20Chief%20Financial)). Medium-term, we expect net interest income to stabilize as deposit costs normalize (as management projects 1–3% growth in NII for 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-earnings-climb-investment-banking-shines-2025-01-15/#:~:text=bank%2C%20under%20CEO%20Charlie%20Scharf%2C,Fargo%20continues%20to%20address%20regulatory))) and loan demand gradually improves. At the same time, deal volume and advisory fees could benefit from industry M&A revival. Overall loan growth may be limited (management expects flat or declining consumer credit in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-says-consumer-loan-growth-stay-muted-or-drop-this-year-2025-06-10/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer%2C,95%20trillion%20asset%20cap%20that))), but diversification into fee businesses and wealth management should help.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
- **Bulls:** (1) *Asset cap lifted* — Removing the $1.95T constraint unlocks expansion and acquisition potential historically blocked for seven years ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=After%20seven%20years%2C%20the%20Federal,by%20the%20Fed%2C%20made%20unanimously)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=Reserve%20lifted%20a%20major%20%241,With)). (2) *Revenue diversification* — Wells is strengthening investment banking and wealth units after IB fees surged 59% QoQ ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-earnings-climb-investment-banking-shines-2025-01-15/#:~:text=3.1,its%20revenue%20sources%20and%20hired)), and its commercial banking is expanding (e.g. adding healthcare lending ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-expands-its-healthcare-team-aims-hire-more-2025-07-16/#:~:text=2025,In))). (3) *Cost efficiency* — Ongoing expense cuts (3–12% annually) and technology investments promise better operating leverage ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=cutting%20and%20reduced%20provisions%20for,due%20to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=Reserve%20lifted%20a%20major%20%241,With)). (4) *Capital returns* — A new $40B buyback program ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-buy-back-up-40-bln-its-common-stock-2025-04-29/#:~:text=On%20April%2029%2C%202025%2C%20Wells,The%20move%20signals%20the%20financial)) and rising dividends support the equity. (5) *Valuation* — Wells trades at a modest P/B and P/E versus large peers; analysts see ~20% EPS CAGR during 2026–28 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-shares-rise-after-fed-ends-growth-freeze-2025-06-04/#:~:text=constrained%20period%2C%20the%20bank%20now,annually%20between%202026%20and%202028)), implying significant upside from current prices.  
- **Bears:** (1) *NII headwinds* — Net interest income is under pressure from higher deposit funding costs and rate cuts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-falls-deposit-costs-2024-07-12/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20second,Net%20income)). Management guided for up to 9% NII decline in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-falls-deposit-costs-2024-07-12/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20second,Net%20income)). Limited loan growth (consumer and commercial) will cap core revenue. (2) *Economic slowdown* — CEO Scharf warned tariffs and trade uncertainty could damp economic growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Blackstone%E2%80%99s%20acquisition%20of%20Safe%20Harbor,dip%20in%20net)), which would further slow loan demand and increase credit costs. (3) *Regulatory and legal risks* — Ongoing compliance issues (e.g. recent OCC enforcement on AML controls ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/occ-issues-enforcement-action-against-wells-fargo-2024-09-12/#:~:text=The%20U,billions%20in%20fines%20and%20continued)), CFPB lawsuits over payment fraud ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5b3249c2-36fc-4962-ad3c-a88bbf2facc0#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau,bank%20liability%20for%20payment%20platform))) could mean fines or restrictions. (4) *Reputational drag* — The legacy of the fake-accounts scandal still weighs on confidence and could limit new business (e.g. customers or employees leaving). (5) *Competition/Fintech* — Fintech lenders and mobile platforms continue to encroach on traditional banking services, potentially shrinking Wells’ market share over time.  

### Economic Moat  
Wells Fargo’s advantage stems largely from scale (massive deposit base and branch footprint) and breadth of services, but the moat is *narrow*. Its products face low switching costs and many competitors. Regulatory penalties (asset cap, consent orders) have historically hampered Wells’ growth and eroded brand trust ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=After%20seven%20years%2C%20the%20Federal,by%20the%20Fed%2C%20made%20unanimously)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/occ-issues-enforcement-action-against-wells-fargo-2024-09-12/#:~:text=The%20U,billions%20in%20fines%20and%20continued)). The Fed’s unanimous lifting of the cap credits substantial progress in governance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/fed-lifts-wells-fargos-asset-cap-citing-progress-sales-scandal-2025-06-03/#:~:text=development%20marks%20a%20significant%20victory,party%20evaluations.%20Investors)), yet new rules (e.g. on capital expansion) still apply. In short, Wells enjoys some size-based scale economies, but lacks a distinct intangible edge (like proprietary technology or brands), putting its moat in the “narrow” category.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our valuation uses a discounted cash flow and relative multiple framework. Key assumptions: revenue rises mid‐single digits annually (reflecting slight loan growth and fee growth), and operating margins gradually improve (from ~18% in 2024 to ~21% by 2029) as expenses normalize. We assume NII growth resumes modestly as deposit costs fall, supporting about 5–7% revenue CAGR (2024–29). We use a WACC of ~9–10% (reflecting a 10% equity cost, 20% debt with 4% yield) and a 2% terminal growth. Bloomberg consensus implies ~20% EPS CAGR through 2028 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-shares-rise-after-fed-ends-growth-freeze-2025-06-04/#:~:text=constrained%20period%2C%20the%20bank%20now,annually%20between%202026%20and%202028)). Our model yields a fair value ~ $85/share (late-2025), equivalent to ~12–13× 2026 EPS, roughly in line with peers’ long-term averages. At $85, the P/B is ~1.3× (2029F TBV) and P/E~7× (2029F), which is modest. Major profit drivers include the margin expansion as deposit costs abate and higher fee income from credit cards and capital markets. If loan growth resumes and non-interest income stays strong, EPS could exceed our base case; conversely, slower revenue or higher provisions could re-cast value downward.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Wells Fargo’s valuation is sensitive to macro and regulatory factors. A U.S. recession or credit crunch could inflate loan losses and depress NII. Management’s warnings about tariffs and growth risks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Blackstone%E2%80%99s%20acquisition%20of%20Safe%20Harbor,dip%20in%20net)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-says-consumer-loan-growth-stay-muted-or-drop-this-year-2025-06-10/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20Chief%20Financial%20Officer%2C,95%20trillion%20asset%20cap%20that)) underscore cyclical uncertainty. Regulatory risk remains: recent OCC enforcement on anti-money-laundering deficiencies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/occ-issues-enforcement-action-against-wells-fargo-2024-09-12/#:~:text=The%20U,billions%20in%20fines%20and%20continued)) and CFPB/Zelle litigation ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5b3249c2-36fc-4962-ad3c-a88bbf2facc0#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau,bank%20liability%20for%20payment%20platform)) illustrate that compliance lapses can spur fines or operational limits. While the asset cap is lifted, some oversight remains (e.g. capital raising restrictions). Interest-rate risk is also key: the bank’s net interest margin may fluctuate with Fed policy and competition, as seen by ~9% NII declines in mid-2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-falls-deposit-costs-2024-07-12/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%27s%20second,Net%20income)). Finally, ESG issues could impact sentiment: abandoning climate targets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/wells-fargo-drops-financed-emissions-target-amid-esg-rethink-2025-02-28/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20has%20announced%20it,commitments%20within%20the%20financial%20industry)) and past governance scandals can trigger reputational or investor-pressure risks. Overall, these factors create high uncertainty around earnings and multiples.  

### Capital Allocation  
Wells Fargo’s balance sheet is well-capitalized (strong Tier 1 ratios pre-asset-cap removal). In May 2025 Moody’s rated its deposits Aa2 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/moodys-downgrades-jpm-bofa-wells-fargo-after-us-credit-rating-cut-2025-05-19/#:~:text=On%20May%2019%2C%202025%2C%20Moody%27s,for%20President%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20tax)) (following a broad US credit cut) and S&P gave a positive outlook post-cap lift ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-positive-wells-fargo-regulatory-burden-lifts-2025-06-06/#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20has%20upgraded%20its,The%20Fed%E2%80%99s%20unanimous%20decision%20marks)), reflecting solid financial standing. Management has prioritized returning capital to shareholders: it authorized a new $40B buyback program ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-buy-back-up-40-bln-its-common-stock-2025-04-29/#:~:text=On%20April%2029%2C%202025%2C%20Wells,The%20move%20signals%20the%20financial)) (on top of ongoing repurchases) and indicated gradual dividend increases ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=focused%20on%20accountability%20and%20meritocracy,dividends%20to%20boost%20investor%20confidence)). Large M&A appears unlikely in the near term ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-ceo-goes-fixer-builder-regulators-lift-punishments-2025-06-04/#:~:text=banking%20industry%20for%20his%20efforts,repositioning%20itself%20as%20a%20competitive)); Wells is focusing on organic growth and selective partnerships. Overall, the bank’s board has demonstrated discipline by reducing the share count ~6–7% annually (2022–24) and boosting payouts as regulatory conditions permit. We rate Wells’ capital allocation *high*, given its shareholder-return focus and improved financial flexibility.

### ESG Risk  
Sustainalytics assigns Wells Fargo a “Medium” ESG risk score of 25.9 ([www.sustainalytics.com](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/wells-fargo-co/1008171137#:~:text=match%20at%20L95%20JPMorgan%20Chase,496%20out%20of%201025)), slightly higher than peers (JPM 23.6, BoA 23.8). Key material issues include socially-oriented risks (fraud prevention, consumer protection) and governance controls. The firm’s retreat from net-zero targets and exit from climate coalitions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/wells-fargo-drops-financed-emissions-target-amid-esg-rethink-2025-02-28/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20has%20announced%20it,commitments%20within%20the%20financial%20industry)) raise environmental controversy. Governance lapses from past scandals and recent AML findings (OCC action ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/occ-issues-enforcement-action-against-wells-fargo-2024-09-12/#:~:text=The%20U,billions%20in%20fines%20and%20continued))) are also high-profile ESG concerns. On sustainability disclosure, Wells shows weaker commitments than some rivals. We consider because of these factors Wells has higher ESG risk than industry leaders; investors are watching remediation of governance and compliance.  

### Appendix

    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a summary of Palo Alto Networks' fiscal Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings releases and management's stated 'platformization' strategy. It fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis. Every insight identified is either a direct restatement of financial results (NGS ARR, RPO growth) or a generic industry observation (cybersecurity spending caution, secular trends). The valuation section is particularly boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF assumptions\u2014such as a 15% revenue CAGR and margin expansion\u2014without identifying a novel driver or specific mechanism beyond 'scale efficiencies.' There are no non-obvious, testable catalysts or peer-specific angles that aren't already available in public filings or consensus news. Consequently, the report lacks decision relevance and fails the minimum threshold for originality.",

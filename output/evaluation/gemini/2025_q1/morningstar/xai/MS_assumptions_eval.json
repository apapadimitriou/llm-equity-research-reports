    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to a significant internal numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. While the report explicitly lists key inputs such as a 5% revenue CAGR, 8.5% WACC, and 3% terminal growth, the WACC calculation is internally inconsistent. The provided components\u2014a 4% risk-free rate, 1.2 beta, and 6% equity risk premium\u2014calculate to an 11.2% cost of equity using the standard CAPM formula, which contradicts the stated 8.5% WACC without any explanation of capital structure or debt costs. Furthermore, the report fails to provide quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for its primary drivers. Although it mentions a general '\u00b120% valuation swing' and a potential revenue decline in a recession, these are high-level output observations rather than stress-tests showing how specific changes in inputs (like NIM, WACC, or segment growth) impact the fair value estimate. Justifications are also relatively thin, relying on short-term quarterly beats rather than multi-year historical context or detailed peer benchmarking. This lack of mathematical coherence and the absence of driver-level sensitivities prevent the model from being auditable or robust.",

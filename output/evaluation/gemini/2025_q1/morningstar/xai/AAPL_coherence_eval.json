    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is professionally structured but fails significantly on coherence due to multiple unresolved contradictions and impossible temporal claims. The report is dated May 2, 2025, yet it cites sources from July and September 2025 (Sources 6 and 7), which is a major failure in factual integrity and temporal alignment. Additionally, Source 8 references 'Q3 2025' results in February 2025, a chronological impossibility given Apple\u2019s fiscal calendar and the report's own focus on Q1 results.\n\nInternal data consistency is also poor. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section projects a 2025 operating margin of 30%, while the 'Financials Snapshot' table lists 30.5%. Similarly, the narrative forecasts 2029 revenue at $500 billion, but the table shows $498.3 billion. The report also fails to reconcile its base-case valuation with the 'Bears Say' and 'Risk' sections; it assumes operating margins will expand to 32% by 2029 despite explicitly noting that regulatory scrutiny could impact 20% of revenue and compress margins. This lack of reconciliation between the bull/bear risks and the base-case assumptions forces the reader to assemble a coherent argument themselves. Because the report contains multiple material contradictions and relies on future-dated citations that invalidate the narrative's credibility, it meets the criteria for a poor grade. The combination of temporal inaccuracies and data mismatches triggers the mandatory caps and downgrades.",

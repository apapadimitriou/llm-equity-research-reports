    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to multiple significant internal contradictions and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly states key assumptions such as a 18% revenue CAGR, a 7.5% WACC, and a 3% terminal growth rate, these figures are not internally consistent. Specifically, the 18% revenue CAGR cited in the narrative is mathematically irreconcilable with the 'Financials Snapshot' table, which implies a CAGR of approximately 13.1% from 2025 to 2029. Additionally, the report contains a blatant contradiction regarding the valuation multiple: the Analyst Note cites a forward P/E of 45x, whereas the Fair Value section calculates 58.6x to justify the $850 price target. Justification for these inputs is weak, often relying on generic industry averages or 'historical patterns' without specific evidence. Furthermore, the report fails the sensitivity requirement; it offers only a qualitative mention of a \u00b120% uncertainty range without quantifying how specific material drivers (like obesity drug pricing or R&D success) impact the valuation. Per the decision rules, the combination of two distinct numeric contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivities mandates a 'Poor' rating.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by moving beyond description into causal modeling. It provides a clear EPS bridge, attributing specific gains to revenue growth ($0.50) and margin expansion ($0.30). Causal mechanisms are identified, such as 'scale reduces costs relative to revenue' and the link between NRR and 'moderating expansion.' Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, specifically citing the terminal growth rate as the 'Long-term industry average.' The report addresses uncertainty by quantifying a potential valuation 'swing [of] 20-30%' based on macro and regulatory risks. However, it falls short of an 'Excellent' grade due to the lack of detailed, multi-variable sensitivity tables or distinct bull/bear price targets. Furthermore, a significant internal contradiction exists between the text ('15% terminal growth') and the appendix ('4.0%'), which undermines the precision of the valuation model. While it identifies 'AI monetization' as a key watch point, it fails to quantify the specific revenue or margin contribution expected from these new features, leaving the AI impact somewhat generic.",

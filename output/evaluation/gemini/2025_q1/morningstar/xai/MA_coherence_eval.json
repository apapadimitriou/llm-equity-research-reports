    "reasoning": "The report is fundamentally incoherent due to severe temporal contradictions and internal mathematical discrepancies. Most notably, the report is dated May 2, 2025, yet it cites five separate sources (5, 8, 10, 11, and 12) with dates ranging from June 2025 to September 2025. This 'future-dating' of evidence makes the narrative logically impossible. Furthermore, there is a significant contradiction between the narrative valuation and the provided financial data: the Analyst Note claims the $550 Fair Value Estimate (FVE) implies a 35x forward P/E on 2026 EPS, but the Financials Snapshot table lists 2026E EPS as $18.40, which results in a P/E of only 29.9x. Additionally, the narrative refers to 2024 revenue as an 'estimate' ($29.25 billion) despite the report being written in mid-2025 and the table labeling the 2024 figure as 'Actual' (2024A). While the report maintains a standard structure, the 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' section is not reconciled with the base-case valuation; for example, the bear concern regarding regulatory fee caps is not reflected in the projected operating margin expansion (from 56% to 58%) or the stable WACC. These unresolved tensions between the text, the tables, and the cited sources require the reader to reconstruct the argument themselves.",

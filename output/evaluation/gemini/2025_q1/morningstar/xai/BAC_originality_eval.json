    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying instead on restating public earnings data and generic sector-wide boilerplate. The core thesis\u2014that the bank benefits from 'scale and diversification'\u2014is a standard industry descriptor rather than a specific, testable investment angle. Insights regarding net interest income (NII) and interest rate impacts are merely restatements of news headlines from the provided sources (e.g., CNBC, X/Twitter) without interpretive commentary. The valuation section is particularly weak in originality, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (revenue CAGR and margin expansion) without identifying any novel company-specific drivers or mechanisms. No evidence exists of the analyst linking disparate data points (such as specific deposit beta trajectories or loan mix shifts) to form new conclusions. Consequently, the report offers zero decision-relevant originality beyond what is available in public filings and news summaries.",

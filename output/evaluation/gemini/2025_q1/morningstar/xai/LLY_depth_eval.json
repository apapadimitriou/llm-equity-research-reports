    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide a structured valuation framework. It features clear causal reasoning, such as linking margin expansion to 'manufacturing efficiencies' and the EPS miss to 'supply chain issues.' Assumptions are explicit and partially benchmarked, notably the terminal growth rate tied to the 'Long-term pharma industry average' and a detailed WACC breakdown (Beta 0.9, ERP 5%). A notable strength is the EPS bridge, which decomposes the 2025 forecast into specific drivers: '+$1.50 from revenue growth - $0.50 from margin compression.' This level of transparency allows investors to see the logic behind the $14.50 EPS target. However, the report fails to reach 'Excellent' because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or distinct scenario modeling (e.g., Bull/Bear cases). While it acknowledges uncertainty by stating 'valuation swings of \u00b120% possible,' it does not provide a sensitivity matrix or demonstrate how specific changes in key drivers\u2014like obesity drug market share or R&D spend\u2014would numerically impact the fair value estimate. Verbatim excerpts: 'driven by strong sales of key products,' 'reflecting manufacturing efficiencies but pressured by R&D,' 'Terminal growth 3%... Long-term pharma industry average,' and '2024 base EPS $13.00... + $1.50 from revenue growth.'",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework but fails significantly on depth and data integrity. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot is severely deficient, omitting three years of historical data (2022\u20132024) with 'Insufficient data' placeholders, which is unacceptable for a comprehensive analysis of a mature large-cap entity. While the report identifies key growth drivers like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, it lacks a dedicated table for sector-specific KPIs such as individual product revenue or a pipeline status tracker, which are essential for Biopharma research. Furthermore, peer benchmarking is entirely absent, leaving the valuation and competitive positioning without necessary industry context. Although the valuation section attempts to link operating drivers to the fair value estimate and includes a basic sensitivity range, the lack of historical context and the omission of granular sector data trigger hard caps on the grade. The report provides a skeletal overview rather than an exhaustive research document.",

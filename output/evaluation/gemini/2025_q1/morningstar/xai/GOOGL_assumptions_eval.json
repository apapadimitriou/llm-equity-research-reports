{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple internal contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. First, there is a significant numeric discrepancy regarding operating margins: the narrative projects a 32% average, the appendix states 32.5%, and the financial snapshot table implies a 33.0% average. Second, the WACC of 8.0% is mathematically inconsistent with the provided CAPM inputs (Beta of 1.1, Risk-free rate of 4.0%, and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%), which calculate to a Cost of Equity of 10.05%. Given the company's net cash position and low leverage, an 8.0% WACC is unjustified and contradicts the report's own parameters. Finally, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenarios for its material drivers. While it mentions a 'potential 20% valuation swing,' this is a qualitative statement regarding the output uncertainty rather than a stress test of specific inputs like revenue growth or margins. According to the rubric, the combination of multiple contradictions and the lack of driver-specific sensitivities triggers a Poor rating. Although the assumptions are explicitly stated and proximal to the forecasts, these logical and mathematical failures render the model's outputs unreliable.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a poor grade due to fundamental internal contradictions and temporal misalignments that undermine its credibility. The most glaring issue is the disconnect between the narrative and the data tables. The Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and the Appendix repeatedly claim insufficient data to provide quantitative metrics or valuation assumptions. Conversely, the Financials Snapshot table presents precise, granular forecasts for revenue, operating margins, EPS, and FCF through FY2029. This creates a total breakdown in coherence; the reader is told data does not exist while being shown a table full of that exact data. Furthermore, the report contains a significant temporal error: it is dated May 22, 2025, yet cites a source [7] from September 2025, an impossible future date relative to the report's publication. The Analyst Note also claims a lack of Q4 FY2025 metrics despite the report being published the day after those results were supposedly released, and the financial table labeling FY2025 as a Forecast rather than Actual. These discrepancies suggest the narrative and the tables were produced in isolation without any cross-referencing. Finally, the Bulls/Bears section is not reconciled with a base-case valuation because the report fails to establish one, leaving the reader to assemble the investment thesis themselves.",

        "Fair Value and Profit Drivers claims 'insufficient data... prevents a detailed valuation model,' yet the Financials Snapshot table provides specific Revenue and EPS forecasts through FY2029.",
        "Source [7] is dated 'September 2025,' which post-dates the report's 'May 22, 2025' publication date (Sources Section).",
        "The Key Valuation Assumptions Table in the Appendix lists 'Insufficient data' for Revenue CAGR and Op Margin, contradicting the 4-6% CAGR and 21-23% margins implied in the Financials Snapshot."

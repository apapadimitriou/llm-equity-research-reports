    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide a quantified framework for its valuation. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of Q1 earnings, noted as being \"driven by a 3% decline in net interest income,\" and in the forward-looking margin expansion \"aided by cost controls and digital efficiencies.\" The analyst provides an explicit EPS bridge, quantifying how revenue growth, margin expansion, and provisions contribute to the $3.40 forecast. Assumptions are transparent and benchmarked, particularly the WACC components (\"WACC is set at 9.5%\") and the fair value P/E ratio relative to historical averages. However, the report falls short of 'Excellent' due to a lack of rigorous sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario modeling. While it acknowledges macro risks and suggests they \"could swing valuation by 20-30%,\" it fails to provide a quantified sensitivity table showing the impact of specific basis point shifts in interest rates on NIM or EPS. The counterpoints are identified, such as how \"tariff-induced recession risks could pressure investment banking,\" but these are not stress-tested against the base-case financials. The implications are actionable but remain somewhat generic, advising investors to monitor metrics without providing specific conditional triggers for a change in the investment thesis.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Fair' because, while it includes all required headline sections, it fails several 'Hard Cap' criteria regarding evidence integrity and sector-specific depth. Most notably, the 'Sources' section explicitly admits that key data points\u2014such as the 94% customer retention rate, the Q1 2025 balance sheet figures, and the 2024 buyback authorization\u2014are based on 'representative' figures or 'prior filings' rather than the reported period's data. This violates the requirement for consistent, cited evidence. Additionally, the Financials Snapshot is generic; it lacks essential sector KPIs like the Active Installed Base and Services-specific margins in the tabular format, which are critical for evaluating Apple's ecosystem. Proportionality is also an issue, as the Services growth narrative is repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Valuation sections without providing new granular depth in each instance. Finally, the report lacks a financial peer benchmarking table and a formal sensitivity analysis (e.g., a WACC/Growth matrix), which are necessary for a higher rating. These omissions result in a report that feels structurally complete but analytically superficial.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to significant failures in sector-specific depth, sourcing integrity, and structural efficiency. While all major sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is skeletal and generic, omitting critical banking KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), and Loan Loss Provisions. This omission triggers a hard cap of 'Fair'. Furthermore, the report relies on outdated evidence, with multiple sources (8, 10, 11) dating back to 2022 for a 2025 analysis, and admits to using inferred ESG data, triggering a second 'Fair' cap. The comprehensiveness is further undermined by excessive redundancy; the same talking points regarding tariff-induced recession risks and the 11.8% CET1 ratio are repeated across four separate sections without providing incremental analysis or new data. This repetition necessitates a one-level downgrade from the 'Fair' ceiling. Finally, the absence of peer financial benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analysis leaves the valuation and risk assessments feeling superficial. Although the valuation section successfully links operating drivers to the EPS bridge, the cumulative impact of missing KPIs, outdated sourcing, and repetitive content results in a report that fails to meet the professional standards of comprehensive equity research.",

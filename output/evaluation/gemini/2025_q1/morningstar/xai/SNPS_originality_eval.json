    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on restating public information from the Q1 2025 earnings press release and general industry consensus. There are zero instances where the analyst links disparate data points to form a new conclusion; instead, the report offers generic observations about the AI boom and geopolitical tensions that are widely known. The valuation section is particularly weak, utilizing boilerplate DCF assumptions (8% CAGR, 4% terminal growth) without identifying any company-specific novel drivers or mechanisms. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections use standard industry templates that could apply to any major EDA software firm. Because there is no synthesis or original thesis present, and the insights are largely generic restatements of public headlines, the report meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",

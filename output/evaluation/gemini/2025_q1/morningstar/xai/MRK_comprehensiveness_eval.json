    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all mandatory headline sections but fails to meet the depth and consistency requirements for a higher grade. A significant deficiency is found in the Financials Snapshot, which omits all historical data (2022\u20132024) and lacks sector-specific product-level forecasts in the tabular format, despite these being critical for a biopharma analysis. While the Analyst Note provides a clear summary of Q1 2025 results, the report exhibits high redundancy; the Bulls/Bears section and Economic Moat section repeat the same data points (Keytruda growth, Gardasil decline) without adding new analytical depth. Furthermore, there is a major temporal contradiction: the report is dated April 2025, yet several cited sources are dated September 2025, suggesting a lack of internal consistency or factual integrity. The absence of a dedicated peer benchmarking table and the lack of scenario or sensitivity analysis further limit the report's comprehensiveness. Although the valuation section attempts to link drivers to the fair value estimate, the overall lack of historical context and comparative industry data caps the grade at Fair.",

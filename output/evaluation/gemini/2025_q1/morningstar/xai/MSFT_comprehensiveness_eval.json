    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structure and includes all major sections, but it is limited by significant gaps in sector-specific data and sourcing. The Financials Snapshot is generic, providing only high-level financial metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting critical sector-specific KPIs such as Azure constant-currency growth forecasts, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), or commercial seat growth within the multi-year table. This triggers a hard cap on the grade. Furthermore, the report explicitly admits to 'insufficient data' for several material claims, including the $1.5 trillion cloud market projection, LinkedIn user statistics, and the specific ESG risk score, which violates the requirement for consistent, cited evidence. While the valuation section successfully links operating drivers (segment growth and margin expansion) to the fair value estimate, the report lacks a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis. Peer context is also superficial, mentioned only in passing without a dedicated benchmarking table. Finally, there is notable redundancy regarding AI capital expenditures and Azure growth rates across the Analyst Note and Strategy sections without providing incremental depth in the latter.",

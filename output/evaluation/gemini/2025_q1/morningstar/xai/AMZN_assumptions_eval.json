    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for revenue growth, operating margins, and capital costs, clearly located within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix. Justification is partial, relying on segment-specific trends (AWS vs. e-commerce) and broad macroeconomic benchmarks (GDP + inflation). However, the report fails to achieve a 'Good' grade due to a significant internal numeric contradiction and insufficient sensitivity analysis. Specifically, the WACC is stated as 8.0%, but the provided components (4% risk-free rate, 1.2 beta, and 5% equity risk premium) mathematically result in 10.0% using the CAPM formula. This unresolved contradiction between the stated parameter and its components violates the consistency pillar. Furthermore, while the report mentions a potential 10% revenue miss and a 30% valuation swing in the 'Risk & Uncertainty' section, it lacks a structured sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis showing how variations in key drivers (e.g., AWS growth rates or terminal growth) impact the fair value estimate. Per the grading instructions, the presence of a numeric contradiction and the lack of quantified sensitivity tables cap the grade at 'Fair'.",

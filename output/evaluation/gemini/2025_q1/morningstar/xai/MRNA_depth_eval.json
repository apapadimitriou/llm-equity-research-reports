    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by connecting financial outcomes to specific operational drivers. It provides a clear causal link between high R&D spending and the resulting net losses, while projecting margin expansion based on 'R&D efficiency' and 'scale benefits.' Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, such as the 'WACC of 9.5%' and 'Terminal growth 3%,' which are tied to sector averages. The report quantifies its forecasts, including a specific revenue mix assumption: '10% growth in non-COVID vaccines offsetting a 20% COVID decline.' While it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity table or multi-case scenario analysis (e.g., Bull/Base/Bear DCF), it does provide a quantified estimate of uncertainty, noting that 'regulatory hurdles... could swing valuation by 20-30%.' This provides actionable context for investors. However, the mechanism for 'R&D efficiency' remains somewhat generic, and the path to a 15% operating margin from a -50% base is not fully detailed with specific cost-cutting measures. Verbatim excerpts: 'Operating margins improve... as R&D efficiency rises'; '10% growth in non-COVID vaccines offsetting a 20% COVID decline'; 'Regulatory hurdles... could swing valuation by 20-30%'; 'WACC of 9.5%, reflecting biotech sector risks'; 'Terminal growth 3%... Long-term biotech average.'",

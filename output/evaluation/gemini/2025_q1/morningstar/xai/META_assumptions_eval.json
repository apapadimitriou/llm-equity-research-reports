    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple significant internal numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. First, the WACC calculation is mathematically incoherent: the report cites a 6% risk-free rate, a 5% equity risk premium, and a 1.2 beta, which calculates to a 12% cost of equity, yet the report uses 8.5% as the model input without explanation. Second, the EPS bridge is logically broken; it claims that starting from a 2025 EPS of $25.00, adding $5.00 from revenue and $2.00 from margins while subtracting $1.00 for taxes results in a 2029 EPS of $40.00, when the arithmetic sum is actually $31.00. Third, there is a discrepancy in the terminal operating margin, cited as 42% in the narrative but 43% in the Appendix table. Furthermore, the report fails the sensitivity requirement, offering only a vague qualitative mention of a '20% swing' without providing a quantified sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis for material drivers like ad pricing or AI-related capex. While assumptions are explicitly stated and specific in terms of units and horizons, the lack of internal coherence and the absence of stress-testing render the model a 'black box' that cannot be audited or trusted.",

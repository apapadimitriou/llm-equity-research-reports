    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Poor' grade due to significant internal contradictions and the absence of a robust sensitivity framework. While the report explicitly states several key drivers\u2014such as a 5.5% revenue CAGR and an 8.0% WACC\u2014it fails the consistency test. Most notably, there is a massive unresolved discrepancy between the EPS figures in the narrative and the Financials Snapshot table. The text forecasts 2025 and 2029 EPS of $11.80 and $14.50, respectively, while the table lists $7.90 and $9.90 for the same periods. This ~46% variance in the terminal year makes the model unauditable. Furthermore, the report contains a logical contradiction regarding margins: the Analyst Note forecasts EBITDA margins 'expanding to around 24%,' yet the Economic Moat section claims the company already achieved 24% in FY2024.\n\nJustification is partial; while revenue growth is linked to the $31 billion backlog, other inputs like the 3.0% terminal growth rate are dismissed with generic 'industry average' labels. Specificity is generally good regarding units and horizons, but the lack of transparency regarding share count\u2014despite mentioning $1 billion in annual buybacks\u2014leaves a material driver opaque. Finally, sensitivity analysis is insufficient. The report provides a single point-estimate for WACC sensitivity (\u00b115%) and a vague revenue risk (2-3%) but lacks a comprehensive scenario table or quantified impact on the $240 fair value estimate across multiple variables.",

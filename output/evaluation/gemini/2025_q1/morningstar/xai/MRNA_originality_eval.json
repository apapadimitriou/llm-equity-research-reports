    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning primarily as a summary of publicly available information. It recaps the Q1 2025 earnings results and the January 2025 guidance revision without adding interpretive commentary or non-obvious conclusions. All identified insights are either restatements of financial headlines (e.g., the 91% revenue drop and guidance cuts) or generic industry perspectives regarding the potential of mRNA technology and pipeline diversification. The valuation section is particularly weak, utilizing a standard DCF model with boilerplate drivers such as 'revenue CAGR' and 'R&D efficiency' without quantifying specific mechanisms or providing company-distinct angles. There is no evidence of linking disparate data points to form new conclusions, and the report lacks any specific catalysts or monitoring signals that are not already public knowledge. Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

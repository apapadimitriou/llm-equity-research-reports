    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a critical temporal paradox. It is dated April 12, 2025, yet the bibliography and citations reference events and transcripts from July and September 2025 (e.g., Sources 3, 7, 8, 9, 10). This makes the 'recent' claims regarding Q1 results logically impossible to verify within the provided timeline. Furthermore, there is a direct contradiction between the narrative and the sources: the Analyst Note cites Source [3] for Q1 2025 results, but the source itself is titled as a Q2 2025 transcript. While the narrative flow between sections like Moat and Valuation is structurally sound, these foundational errors in dating and citation alignment destroy the report's credibility. The financial table labels 2024 as 'Actual' and 2025 as 'Forecast,' which is consistent with an April 2025 date, but the inclusion of future-dated sources creates an unresolved tension that the reader cannot reconcile. Additionally, the EPS run rate from Q1 ($9.80) implies a $39.20 annual figure, which is lower than the 2024 actual of $40.00, contradicting the narrative of 'solid results' and 'margin expansion' leading to a 2025 forecast of $45.00. These misalignments between the quarterly data, the annual forecasts, and the source dates require the reader to assemble a coherent argument themselves.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required headline sections and provides a clear valuation bridge using a DCF model. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. First, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for a test and measurement company, such as Order growth, Backlog, and Software/Services mix; while mentioned in the text, these are absent from the data tables. Second, there is significant redundancy; the same talking points regarding AI, 6G, and automotive electrification are repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Bulls/Bears sections without adding incremental depth. Third, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking analysis, providing only vague references to competitors without comparative metrics. Finally, while a fair value estimate is provided, the report lacks any sensitivity or scenario analysis (e.g., bull/bear cases or WACC/growth matrices) to address the 'Medium' uncertainty rating. These gaps, combined with the use of an outdated 2021 source for geographic revenue splits in a 2025 report, result in a document that covers the basics but lacks the analytical depth required for a higher grade.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to significant temporal inaccuracies and internal data contradictions that disrupt the narrative's logical flow. The most critical failure is the inclusion of sources dated September 2025 (Sources [6], [12], [22]) in a report dated May 1, 2025. This chronological impossibility suggests a fundamental breakdown in document assembly and fact-checking. Additionally, there is a lack of internal synchronization regarding data recency: while the Analyst Note discusses Q3 2025 results released on April 30, 2025, the Capital Allocation section relies on balance sheet data from 'fiscal 2025 Q1.' This reliance on outdated figures in one section while acknowledging newer data in another creates an unresolved tension. Furthermore, the report contains internal contradictions regarding growth projections; the Analyst Note forecasts a 15% revenue CAGR through 2029, which directly contradicts the 13% CAGR stated in both the Fair Value section and the Appendix. While the report shows some strength in numerical consistency between the Fair Value narrative and the Financials Snapshot table regarding margin expansion (42% to 45%), these are negated by the structural flaws. The Business Description and Appendix sections also read as list-like bullet dumps, failing to provide the connective tissue required for a cohesive argument. Ultimately, the reader is forced to reconcile conflicting timelines and growth rates.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple internal numeric contradictions that undermine the reliability of the model. Specifically, the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section projects revenue growth of 8-10% through 2027, which directly conflicts with the 7% CAGR used in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix. Furthermore, a discrepancy exists regarding the 2025 operating margin, which is cited as 37% in the narrative but recorded as 37.5% in the Financials Snapshot table. While the report is explicit in stating its assumptions\u2014providing a clear WACC breakdown (8.5%) and terminal growth rate (3.0%)\u2014and includes some quantified sensitivity analysis (e.g., the impact of a 10% market drop on fees), these strengths are negated by the lack of internal consistency. The justification for the 7% revenue CAGR is only partially supported by a vague reference to AUM growth without detailed historical context or peer benchmarking. The presence of two distinct contradictions between the text and the tables triggers the mandatory 'Poor' grade under the evaluation framework, as the assumptions are not auditable or coherent across the document.",

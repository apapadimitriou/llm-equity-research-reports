    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required headline sections, but its comprehensiveness is significantly undermined by the omission of core sector-specific KPIs in the Financials Snapshot and the presence of multiple 'insufficient data' placeholders. For a Life Sciences Tools/CRO firm, Backlog and Book-to-Bill are essential metrics; while mentioned in the text, they are absent from the multi-year forecast table, which remains generic. Furthermore, the report fails the evidence consistency check by explicitly noting 'insufficient data' for material claims regarding capital allocation (Net Debt/EBITDA, buyback totals) and industry growth rates. Valuation is linked to operating drivers, but the analysis lacks a formal scenario/sensitivity table (e.g., Bull/Bear cases), providing only a brief mention of WACC sensitivity. Peer benchmarking is skeletal, limited to brief mentions rather than a comparative analysis. Finally, the report exhibits redundancy, repeating the backlog and booking figures across the Analyst Note, Moat, and Bulls/Bears sections without adding incremental depth in each instance.",

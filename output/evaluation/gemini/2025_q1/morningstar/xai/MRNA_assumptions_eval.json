    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails primarily due to significant internal numeric contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis, triggering multiple 'Hard Cap' overrides. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as WACC (9.5%), terminal growth (3%), and margin targets (15%), these inputs are undermined by severe consistency issues. Specifically, the narrative projects a 5% revenue CAGR from 2025\u20132029, yet the provided financial snapshot table shows revenue growing from $2,000M to $3,500M over that period, which represents a ~15% CAGR. Furthermore, the report claims that 10% growth in non-COVID vaccines will offset a 20% decline in COVID vaccines to achieve this growth; however, given that COVID vaccines are described as the 'majority of historical revenues,' the math is fundamentally irreconcilable with the projected total revenue increase. Justification for parameters like WACC and terminal growth is weak, relying on generic 'sector averages' without specific peer benchmarking or source data. Finally, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like revenue growth or discount rates, offering only a vague qualitative statement that regulatory hurdles could 'swing valuation by 20-30%.' Per the instruction's decision rules, the presence of two distinct contradictions combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for comprehensiveness due to significant omissions in sector-specific data and evidence consistency. While all headline sections are present, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks critical pharmaceutical KPIs such as R&D expenditure, pipeline/trial progression, and product-specific revenue splits (e.g., Mounjaro vs. Zepbound volumes). This triggers a hard cap at 'Fair'. Furthermore, the report explicitly admits to using 'insufficient data' for material claims regarding capital allocation (buybacks) and ESG metrics, which violates the requirement for consistent evidence and further reinforces the 'Fair' cap. The report suffers from excessive redundancy, repeating the '45% revenue growth' and 'TuneLab' talking points across four different sections (Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, Moat, and Strategy) without adding new depth, necessitating a one-level downgrade. Finally, the absence of a formal peer benchmarking table or comparative analysis and the lack of a quantitative sensitivity/scenario analysis result in a final grade of 'Poor'.",

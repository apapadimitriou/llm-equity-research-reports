    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, alongside a lack of robust sensitivity analysis for core valuation drivers. The most glaring issue is the EPS forecast: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section describes an EPS bridge starting at $13.50 in 2025 and reaching $14.50 by 2029 (a net $1.00 increase), whereas the 'Financials Snapshot' table forecasts $15.50 for 2029 (a $2.00 increase). Furthermore, the components of the bridge (+$1.00 revenue, +$0.50 margin, -$0.50 provisions) do not reconcile with the linear $0.50 annual growth shown in the table. While the report explicitly states key assumptions like WACC (9%) and Revenue CAGR (5%), it fails to provide quantified sensitivity tables for these material levers, offering only a vague \u00b1$20 fair value range and a single macro scenario regarding unemployment. Additionally, the report lacks a specific share count assumption, which is a critical omission given the $35B Discover merger context and its impact on EPS. These contradictions and omissions make the model's outputs feel like a 'black box' that does not align with the provided data.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded 'poor' due to severe internal contradictions and a critical temporal failure that undermines the document's integrity. Most significantly, the report is dated May 2, 2025, yet it cites the launch of the 'TuneLab' platform and references Source [3] with a date of September 9, 2025. This inclusion of future events as historical facts is a major coherence failure. Furthermore, there is a blatant mathematical contradiction regarding valuation: the Analyst Note claims the $850 fair value estimate (FVE) implies a 45x forward P/E on 2025 EPS of $14.50, but that math results in only $652.50. The Fair Value section later correctly identifies the P/E as 58.6x for the $850 target, revealing a lack of cross-sectional alignment. Additionally, the 'Bears Say' section highlights a 2024 guidance cut as a key risk, which is not reconciled with the 'Financials Snapshot' that already lists '2024A' (actual) results. The report also suffers from list-like formatting in the Bulls/Bears and Risk sections, lacking the connective tissue required for a 'good' or 'excellent' rating. These unresolved tensions between narrative, tables, and dates force the reader to assemble a coherent argument themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "Analyst Note cites a 45x P/E on $14.50 EPS for an $850 FVE, while the Fair Value section cites a 58.6x P/E for the same target.",
        "Report date is 2025-05-02, but it cites Source [3] and the TuneLab launch dated 2025-09-09 (Analyst Note/Sources).",
        "Bears Say #2 focuses on 'lowered 2024 guidance' despite the Financials Snapshot providing finalized '2024A' actuals."

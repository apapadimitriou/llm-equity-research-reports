    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all required structural sections, including a detailed Analyst Note and a clear valuation bridge. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to significant omissions in sector-specific depth and repetitive content. The 'Financials Snapshot' table provides generic corporate metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF, ROIC) but entirely omits core banking KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Provision for Credit Losses, and the Efficiency Ratio. While some figures like Net Interest Income (NII) and the CET1 ratio are mentioned in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast table violates the requirement for sector-appropriate financial snapshots. Furthermore, the report exhibits notable redundancy; the Q1 deposit growth figure ($2.50 trillion) and the CEO's macro-economic cautions are repeated across the Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, and Risk sections without providing new depth or context in subsequent mentions. Peer benchmarking is also insufficient, limited to a brief ESG comparison rather than a comprehensive financial or valuation analysis against industry peers like Bank of America or Citigroup.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to severe internal contradictions and impossible temporal references. The most glaring issue is the discrepancy between the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' narrative and the 'Financials Snapshot' table. The narrative bases its valuation bridge on an 'FY2024 estimated EPS of $0.90,' whereas the table reports an 'FY2024 Actual' loss of -$2.00. This $2.90 per share variance is fundamental to the valuation logic and remains entirely unresolved. Additionally, the report contains significant temporal inaccuracies. While the report is dated May 22, 2025, it cites sources (Sources 8, 9, and 10) from September 2025 and references a 'Q2 2026' earnings call. This suggests the document was assembled from mismatched templates or future-dated data, undermining the 'recent' claims made in the Strategy section regarding the Siemens partnership. Furthermore, the financial table's FY2025 revenue forecast of $3.3 billion exactly matches the 'product revenue' guidance mentioned in the Analyst Note, effectively assigning zero value to the 'professional services' segment described in the Business Description. These logical lapses, combined with the failure to reconcile the declining NRR and high CAC with the 'Wide Moat' designation, force the reader to manually assemble a coherent argument from conflicting data points.",

        "FY2025 revenue forecast ($3.3B) in the table matches the product revenue guidance, contradicting the multi-segment Business Description."

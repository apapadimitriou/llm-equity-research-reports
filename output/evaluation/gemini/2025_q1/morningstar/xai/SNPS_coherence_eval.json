    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from severe internal contradictions and temporal impossibilities that undermine its credibility. Most notably, the report is dated May 29, 2025, yet it cites sources [3] and [4] from September 2025 to discuss Q3 results. This chronological impossibility suggests a failure in document control or the use of hallucinated data. Furthermore, the financial narrative is internally inconsistent. The Analyst Note claims the $600 fair value estimate implies a 40x forward P/E, whereas the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section explicitly calculates this as 55x based on the $10.80 EPS forecast ($600 / $10.80 = 55.5). The revenue projections also conflict; the narrative assumes an 8% CAGR starting from a recovery after Q1 2025, but the Financials Snapshot table shows flat revenue of $6.0 billion for both FY2024 and FY2025e. Structural coherence is further weakened by the lack of reconciliation between the Bulls/Bears and the base-case valuation. The Bears section highlights a Q1 revenue decline and softening demand, yet the valuation assumes immediate margin expansion and steady growth without explaining how the Q1 volatility is overcome. The ESG section is a bullet dump of insufficient data, providing no analytical value. These unresolved tensions between the narrative, the tables, and the cited dates require the reader to reconstruct the argument, justifying a poor grade.",

        "grade": "Poor",
        "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key drivers such as revenue CAGR (25%) and operating margins (expanding to 25%), it fails the consistency test required for a professional evaluation. Specifically, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section cites a '15% terminal growth' rate, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the '4.0%' terminal growth rate listed in the Appendix valuation table. Furthermore, the narrative EPS bridge identifies FY2024 EPS as $0.90, whereas the Financials Snapshot table reports FY2024 Actual EPS as -$2.00, suggesting a major discrepancy between historical data and the model's starting point that is never reconciled.\n\nJustification for these aggressive assumptions is thin, relying on broad secular trends like 'AI adoption' without benchmarking against the current 67% gross margin or the high 31-month CAC payback period mentioned in the text. Most critically, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. The risk section merely offers a qualitative statement that valuation could swing by 20-30%, failing to provide the specific impact of changes in NRR, discount rates, or growth targets on the $180 fair value estimate. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two distinct numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities mandates a 'Poor' rating.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required headline sections, but the depth of analysis is inconsistent, and it fails several hard-cap criteria for a higher grade. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot is skeletal; it lacks historical data for 2022\u20132024 (marked as 'insufficient data') and omits critical banking-sector KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Efficiency Ratio, and Loan Loss Provisions from the data table. While these are mentioned qualitatively in the text, their absence from the financial summary violates the requirement for sector-appropriate quantitative coverage. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated Peer Benchmarking section and Scenario/Sensitivity Analysis, which are necessary for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. There is significant redundancy regarding the Federal Reserve's asset cap and Net Interest Income (NII) pressure, which are repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Moat sections without providing new layers of depth. While the valuation section successfully links operating drivers (revenue CAGR and margin expansion) to the fair value estimate, the overall lack of historical context and peer comparison renders the report's comprehensiveness 'Fair' at best.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a poor grade due to significant internal contradictions and severe temporal misalignments between the narrative and cited sources. Most notably, there is a direct contradiction in the projected 2029 EPS: the Fair Value and Profit Drivers narrative calculates a 2029 EPS of $14.50 (starting from $13.50 and adding/subtracting specific drivers), whereas the Financials Snapshot table explicitly lists the 2029E EPS as $15.50. This $1.00 discrepancy undermines the core valuation thesis and forces the reader to guess which figure is intended for the DCF model. Furthermore, the report suffers from critical temporal inaccuracies regarding its citations. The narrative discusses the Discover merger (announced in February 2024) and 2027 synergies, yet cites Source [5], which is dated October 2020\u2014years before the event occurred. Similarly, Source [3] from October 2023 is used to support claims about institutional activity in Q1 2025. These recent claims are impossible given the provided source dates. While the report structure is standard and the language is clear, these fundamental errors in data integrity and source alignment require the reader to reconstruct the argument, violating the basic requirements for a coherent research product. The failure to reconcile the 2029 EPS figure across the narrative and the table is a material oversight that triggers the fair hard cap, but the added temporal failures justify a poor rating.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for key drivers, including revenue CAGR, operating margins, and WACC components, which are clearly presented in both the narrative and a dedicated appendix. Internal consistency is a strength; the EPS bridge, financial snapshot, and valuation narrative reconcile without numeric contradictions. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' primarily due to the lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While it mentions a potential '+/-20% swing' in fair value, it does not provide a structured sensitivity matrix or specific scenarios showing how changes in material drivers (e.g., interest rates or credit costs) impact the final valuation. Justifications are also relatively thin; the report cites 'efficiency gains' and 'loan growth' as drivers but fails to provide multi-year historical context or peer benchmarks to support the magnitude of the projected 400-basis-point margin expansion. Additionally, while WACC components are specific, they are not tied to cited market sources or detailed risk-free rate derivations, leaving the 9.5% figure weakly justified.",

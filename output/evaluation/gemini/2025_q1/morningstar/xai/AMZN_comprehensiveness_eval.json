    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to significant failures in evidentiary integrity and the omission of critical sector-specific KPIs in the financial reporting. While the report includes all required headline sections, the Financials Snapshot is generic, failing to provide segment-level data for AWS (revenue and margins) or retail-specific metrics like GMV or Prime subscriber growth, which are essential for a comprehensive Amazon analysis. This triggers a hard cap at 'Fair'. Furthermore, the report contains severe temporal contradictions; it is dated May 2, 2025, yet cites sources [8] and [10] from September 2025, suggesting hallucinated or invalid data. Sourcing is further weakened by the use of a 2019 Nasdaq reference for 2025 market share claims. Additionally, the report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating the 17% AWS growth figure and regulatory risk talking points across the Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, and Risk sections with negligible added depth. The lack of a peer benchmarking table and scenario/sensitivity analysis further justifies the downgrade from 'Fair' to 'Poor' under the strict evaluation rules.",

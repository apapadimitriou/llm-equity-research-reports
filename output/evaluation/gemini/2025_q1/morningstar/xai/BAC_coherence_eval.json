    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is dated April 16, 2025, but contains a source ([9]) dated July 17, 2025, which is a clear temporal impossibility. Furthermore, the Analyst Note presents Q1 2025 figures (Revenue $25.8B, NII $14.0B) that are identical to Q1 2024 figures found in Source [1], yet the narrative claims these represent a '2% decline' and a '3% decline' respectively. This indicates a fundamental failure in data integrity and source alignment. The report also exhibits internal contradictions regarding interest rate sensitivity; the Bulls Say section suggests rate cuts would boost Net Interest Income (NII), whereas the Analyst Note implies that the persistence of high rates was the cause of an NII miss, without explaining the bank's positioning. Additionally, the Financials Snapshot uses Source [13] (from January 2024) to justify using estimates for '2024 Actuals,' even though the report is written in April 2025 when full-year 2024 data would be finalized. These systemic errors in dates, source attribution, and financial logic force the reader to reconstruct the facts independently. The lack of reconciliation between the bearish macro outlook (tariffs/recession) and the projected 3% revenue CAGR further diminishes the report's structural coherence.",

        "Analyst Note cites Q1 2025 revenue of $25.8B using Source [1], which is actually a 2024-04-16 source for Q1 2024 results.",
        "Source [9] is dated 2025-07-17, which is three months after the report's publication date of 2025-04-16.",
        "Bulls Say claims rate cuts boost NII, while the Analyst Note attributes an NII miss to rates persisting longer than anticipated (Analyst Note/Bulls Say)."

    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique theses, relying instead on restating publicly available information from the Q1 2025 earnings release and well-known regulatory narratives. The primary insights\u2014declining Net Interest Income (NII) due to deposit costs and the impact of the Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap\u2014are standard market knowledge and lack any proprietary interpretation or quantified causal links. The valuation section is particularly generic, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (3% revenue CAGR, 2.5% terminal growth) without identifying novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms for the projected margin expansion. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for example, the mention of 'digital transformation' is boilerplate and not connected to specific efficiency gains or ROE trajectories. Consequently, the report offers zero decision relevance beyond what is available in news headlines or basic financial data aggregators.",

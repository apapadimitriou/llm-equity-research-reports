    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections and provides a clear valuation bridge from operating drivers (revenue CAGR and margin expansion) to the fair value estimate. However, it fails the comprehensiveness criteria on several fronts. Most critically, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks at least two core sector-specific KPIs (e.g., Debt Issuance Volumes, Retention Rates, or Assets Under Benchmarking) in the tabular data, which triggers a hard cap of 'Fair'. Additionally, the report lacks a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis, providing only a vague mention of a 20% valuation swing in the risk section. Peer benchmarking is superficial, limited to a brief mention of P/E multiples and ESG scores without a comparative table of operating metrics. There is also significant redundancy; the Analyst Note repeats specific data points regarding the IHS Markit merger and margin targets that appear identically in the Moat and Strategy sections without adding incremental depth, which necessitates a downgrade per the instruction rules.",

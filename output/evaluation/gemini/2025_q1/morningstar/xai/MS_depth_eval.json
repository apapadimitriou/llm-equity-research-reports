    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates 'Good' analytical depth by providing a structured valuation framework with explicit causal mechanisms. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of margin expansion ('efficiency gains and scale benefits') and the impact of interest rates on NIM ('higher interest rates boosting net interest margins'). The author provides an explicit EPS bridge, quantifying how revenue growth (+$1.00) and margin expansion (+$0.50) contribute to the 2025 forecast. Assumptions are clearly stated, including a WACC of 8.5% and a 5% revenue CAGR, with valuation multiples benchmarked against 'historical averages.' Uncertainty is addressed through a quantified recession scenario where 'economic downturns... potentially cutting revenue by 10-15%' and a 'potential valuation swing of \u00b120%.' However, the report falls short of 'Excellent' because these elements are not extensive or integrated into a multi-variable sensitivity analysis. For instance, it mentions rate cuts as a headwind but does not quantify the specific impact on NIM or EPS. The actionable implications are clear, linking the 'discount to our fair value' to a 'hold' recommendation, but the conditional logic is relatively simple. Verbatim excerpts: 'efficiency ratio improved to 70%, indicating better cost control'; 'higher interest rates boosting net interest margins'; 'WACC is set at 8.5%... beta of 1.2'; 'potentially cutting revenue by 10-15% in a recession'; 'potential valuation swing of \u00b120%'; 'terminal growth is 3%, leading to the $120 fair value'.",

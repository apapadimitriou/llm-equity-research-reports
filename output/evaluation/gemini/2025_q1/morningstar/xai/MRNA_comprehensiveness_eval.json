    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a complete structure with all required sections present, but it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant gaps in sector-specific depth and sourcing quality. The Financials Snapshot is generic and omits critical Biopharma KPIs such as pipeline phase counts, R&D expense line items, and cash runway (months of liquidity), which are essential for evaluating a loss-making biotech firm. Sourcing is a major weakness; several key valuation and ESG metrics are attributed to 'insufficient data' (Sources 8, 12, 13), and other material claims rely on social media posts (X/Twitter) rather than primary regulatory filings. Furthermore, the report exhibits high redundancy, repeating the $12.2B cash position and the 2025 revenue guidance across four different sections without adding new analytical depth. While the valuation section attempts to link revenue drivers to the fair value estimate, the lack of a formal peer benchmarking table and the absence of scenario/sensitivity analysis for pipeline outcomes solidify a 'Fair' grade under the defined hard caps.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report adheres to the required structural framework, including an Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and a Valuation section with an explicit EPS bridge. However, it fails to meet the criteria for a higher grade due to significant data gaps and chronological inconsistencies. The Financials Snapshot is skeletal, lacking historical data for FY2022 and FY2023, and it omits critical sector-specific KPIs for the Software/EDA industry, such as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), Backlog, or recurring revenue metrics. Furthermore, the report contains a major chronological contradiction: it is dated May 2025, yet it cites sources [3] and [4] from September 2025, which invalidates the evidence integration. Peer benchmarking and scenario/sensitivity analyses are entirely absent, preventing a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. While the valuation section links operating drivers to a fair value estimate, the lack of industry context and the presence of future-dated citations cap the grade at 'Fair' per the decision rules regarding KPI omissions and contradictions.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from a catastrophic temporal failure that undermines its entire credibility. While the cover block and Analyst Note are dated April 12, 2025, multiple sources (5, 8, 9, and 10) are explicitly dated as of September 2025, five months after the report was purportedly written. This 'future-dating' paradox suggests a fundamental failure in document assembly or data integrity. Furthermore, there is a glaring internal contradiction regarding the investment thesis: the Bulls Say section cites 'upgrades to buy ratings' as a positive driver, yet the Analyst Note concludes by recommending that investors 'hold,' creating an unresolved tension between the evidence provided and the final call.\n\nStructural coherence is further weakened by citation misalignment. Source [6], dated 2015, is used to support specific 2025-2027 revenue forecasts and the $120 fair-value estimate, which is logically impossible for a decade-old source. While the Financials Snapshot table aligns numerically with the Fair Value section (e.g., 2025 EPS of $8.80), the narrative flow is frequently interrupted by these logical lapses. The Bulls/Bears section is not reconciled with the base-case 'Hold' recommendation, and the 'Bears Say' regarding technical weakness is left unaddressed in the valuation narrative. These issues force the reader to reconcile conflicting data points independently, meeting the criteria for a poor grade.",

        "Report date of 2025-04-12 contradicts Sources [5, 8, 9, 10] which are dated as of 2025-09-10 (Cover Block/Sources).",
        "Bulls Say cites 'upgrades to buy ratings' [8] while the Analyst Note explicitly states 'We recommend holding' (Analyst Note/Bulls Say).",
        "Source [6] from 2015 is used to justify 2025-2027 revenue projections and the $120 fair-value estimate (Fair Value/Sources)."

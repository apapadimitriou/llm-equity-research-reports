    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is characterized by multiple, severe internal contradictions that undermine its fundamental coherence, particularly regarding financial projections. The most significant conflict exists between the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section, which targets a 2025 EPS of 'at least $28,' and the 'Financials Snapshot' and 'Fair Value' sections, which both project a 2025 EPS of only $17.12. This 63% discrepancy is never addressed. Furthermore, the 'Analyst Note' reports a Q1 2025 EPS of $6.80, which implies an annualized run-rate of approximately $27.20, directly contradicting the $17.12 full-year estimate used in the valuation model and the financials table.\n\nAdditionally, the report's claims regarding growth rates are mathematically incoherent. The 'Analyst Note' cites a 2025 outlook of 'at least 10%' EPS growth, yet the model's jump from a 2024 base of $12.12 to $17.12 represents a 41% increase. The report also fails to reconcile the 'continued momentum' described in the opening with the 'Bears Say' observation that net income halved between 2022 and 2024. While the report maintains a professional structure and provides clear section headers, these pervasive quantitative misalignments require the reader to reconstruct the core argument, as the narrative, tables, and valuation assumptions do not form a unified case.",
    "evidence": [
        "The Strategy section targets 2025 EPS of 'at least $28,' contradicting the Financials Snapshot and Fair Value sections which use '$17.12' (Strategy / Financials Snapshot).",
        "The Analyst Note cites a 10% EPS growth outlook, which is mathematically inconsistent with the 41% jump (from $12.12 to $17.12) projected in the valuation model (Analyst Note / Fair Value).",
        "Q1 2025 EPS of $6.80 reported in the Analyst Note implies an annual run-rate (~$27) that far exceeds the $17.12 full-year estimate provided in the financials table (Analyst Note / Financials Snapshot)."

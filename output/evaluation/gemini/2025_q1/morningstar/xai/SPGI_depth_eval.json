    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a 'Good' level of analytical depth by moving beyond description to provide clear causal mechanisms and benchmarked assumptions. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of margin expansion, cited as being \"supported by margin expansion to 48% from cost efficiencies,\" and the impact of interest rates on debt issuance, noted as \"offset by 5% in Ratings amid issuance volatility.\" The analyst provides a detailed EPS bridge to 2029, quantifying the specific contributions of revenue growth, margin gains, and share repurchases, such as \"reaching $22.00 by 2029 via revenue growth (+$1.50).\" Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, including a comparison of valuation multiples to historical averages (\"25x forward P/E versus historical averages of 28x\") and terminal growth to GDP. While the report acknowledges uncertainty and provides a quantified range for valuation (\"20% valuation swing possible under adverse scenarios\"), it falls short of an 'Excellent' grade because it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix or multiple distinct, quantified scenarios (e.g., specific Bull/Bear cases with adjusted inputs). The implications are actionable, linking the fair value estimate of $500 to a clear buy recommendation based on a 20% upside.",

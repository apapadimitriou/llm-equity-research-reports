    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on restating Q1 2025 earnings results and public information. Every identified insight is either a direct paraphrase of the earnings release (e.g., revenue beats, segment performance) or a generic industry observation (e.g., regulatory scrutiny, market volatility). The valuation section is a standard DCF with boilerplate assumptions (5% CAGR, 8.5% WACC) and lacks any novel driver or company-specific mechanism beyond historical extrapolation. There is no evidence of linking disparate data points\u2014such as specific deposit beta trajectories or efficiency ratio components\u2014into a new conclusion. Consequently, the report offers zero decision-relevant value beyond what is available in a standard news summary or public filing.",

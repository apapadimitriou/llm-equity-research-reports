    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost entirely on restating the Q1 2025 earnings press release and public company targets. Every identified insight is either a direct restatement of reported financial figures (e.g., equities trading revenue beating estimates) or a generic sector observation (e.g., regulatory pressures and competition from fintech). There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for instance, the projection of margin expansion is attributed to vague 'cost efficiencies' rather than a specific, quantified mechanism. The valuation section is boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (9.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without any novel drivers. Furthermore, the reliance on Wikipedia and social media for business descriptions and capital allocation data underscores a lack of proprietary research. Per the decision rules, the absence of any synthesis or original thesis necessitates a grade of Poor.",

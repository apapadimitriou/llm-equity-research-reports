    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits solid analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive statistics to provide clear causal mechanisms and explicit, benchmarked assumptions. It effectively links AI integration (Firefly) to user engagement and upselling, and attributes margin expansion to scale efficiencies. The valuation is supported by a detailed DCF model with quantified inputs, including a WACC of 8.5% and a terminal growth rate of 4.0%. Furthermore, the report includes an EPS bridge that quantifies the impact of revenue, margins, and buybacks on future earnings. While it provides a sensitivity statement and a fair value range, it lacks the multiple, fully-developed quantified scenarios (e.g., discrete Bull/Bear financial models) required for an 'Excellent' rating. Verbatim excerpts: 'AI integrations like Firefly contributing to user engagement', 'Operating margins expand... reflecting scale efficiencies', 'WACC is 8.5%, incorporating a 3% risk-free rate', 'valuation sensitivity of \u00b115% to revenue assumptions', and 'outperforming software peers (average 22.5)'.",

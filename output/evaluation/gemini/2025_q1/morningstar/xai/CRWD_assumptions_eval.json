    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for quality of assumptions due to a combination of internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in listing its key drivers\u2014such as a 25% revenue CAGR, a 10% terminal growth rate, and a 10% WACC\u2014it contains a direct numeric contradiction regarding its margin expansion path. The narrative in the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section claims non-GAAP operating margins will reach 25\u201330% by fiscal 2027, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly forecasts a 22% margin for that same year. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers. It offers only a vague, qualitative statement that risks 'could swing valuation by 30%,' without providing the required ranges or impacts on the fair value estimate for changes in WACC, growth rates, or margins. The terminal growth rate of 10% is also exceptionally high and conflicts with standard valuation norms (typically 2\u20134% for terminal periods), and while it is cited, it is not sufficiently justified for a long-term steady-state assumption. Per the decision rules, the presence of one distinct contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

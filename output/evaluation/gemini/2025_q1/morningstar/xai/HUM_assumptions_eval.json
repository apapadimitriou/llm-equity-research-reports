    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report receives a 'Poor' grade due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key assumptions such as a 5% revenue CAGR, 8% WACC, and 3% terminal growth in an appendix, these figures are undermined by significant internal inconsistencies. The analyst note bases its valuation bridge on a 2024 adjusted EPS of $16.21, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table reports 2024 EPS as $9.98 without explanation or reconciliation. Furthermore, the 2025 forecast EPS in the table ($15.88) conflicts with the $16.25 adjusted guidance highlighted in the narrative. Justification for margin expansion (rising to 3.8% by 2029) is weak, cited only as 'efficiency initiatives' without historical context or peer benchmarking. Crucially, the report fails the sensitivity requirement; although it qualitatively mentions that regulatory changes could swing fair value by \u00b120%, it provides no quantified sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis for material drivers like medical benefit ratios or Star Ratings. According to the decision rules, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the lack of quantified sensitivities, mandates a 'Poor' rating.",

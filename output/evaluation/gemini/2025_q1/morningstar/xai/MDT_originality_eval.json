    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on restating information from the cited company press releases. It explicitly acknowledges a lack of data for quantitative modeling, resulting in a valuation section that is purely hypothetical and lacks any company-specific drivers or mechanisms. The insights provided\u2014such as the impact of an aging population on medical device demand or the existence of switching costs\u2014are generic to the healthcare sector and offer no specific, actionable perspective for an investor. There is no attempt to link disparate data points (e.g., connecting the Pulsed Field Ablation launch to specific margin expansion targets or market share shifts relative to peers). The report functions as a summary of news headlines rather than an original piece of equity research, providing zero decision-relevant value beyond what is available in public filings.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for high-quality assumptions due to a combination of internal numeric contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in listing its key drivers\u2014such as a 10% revenue CAGR, a 58% terminal operating margin, and a 4% terminal growth rate\u2014it contains a significant internal inconsistency regarding the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The report explicitly states a WACC of 8.5% in both the narrative and the appendix, yet the provided components (4% risk-free rate, 1.0 beta, and 5% equity risk premium) mathematically result in a 9.0% cost of equity/WACC under the Capital Asset Pricing Model. This 50-basis-point discrepancy is left unresolved and undermines the integrity of the discounted cash flow model. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers. While it qualitatively mentions that macro risks could cut revenue by 5\u201310%, it does not provide a range for the fair value estimate or demonstrate how changes in WACC or terminal growth would impact the $550 valuation. Per the grading instructions, the presence of one distinct numeric contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to multiple unresolved contradictions between the narrative and supporting data, as well as significant temporal and citation errors. A primary failure is the mathematical inconsistency regarding growth: the Fair Value section and Appendix claim a 5% revenue CAGR (2025\u20132029), yet the Financials Snapshot table shows revenue growing from $2,000M to $3,500M, which is actually a 15% CAGR. This discrepancy invalidates the core valuation model. Additionally, the report contains a disqualifying temporal error, citing a source (Source [6]) dated September 2025 for a report published in May 2025. The Economic Moat section also lacks internal coherence; it uses 2023 revenue data to support its claims while ignoring the 91% revenue decline reported in the Analyst Note for the current period (Q1 2025). Furthermore, the Bulls Say section\u2014which suggests sustained revenue from boosters\u2014is never reconciled with the base-case valuation assumption of a 20% COVID decline, triggering a mandatory downgrade. The use of a political cartoonist (Source [2]) as a source for EPS and operating expense data further compromises the report's credibility. These cumulative errors force the reader to reconstruct the argument from conflicting facts, meeting the criteria for a poor grade.",

        "Revenue CAGR 2025-2029 of 5% (Appendix) vs. table showing $2,000M to $3,500M, which is a 15% CAGR (Financials Snapshot).",
        "Source [6] is dated 2025-09-08, which post-dates the report's 2025-05-02 publication date.",
        "Moat section cites $1.86B in Q1 2023 revenue as evidence of strength, ignoring the $167M Q1 2025 revenue cited in the Analyst Note."

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying entirely on restating public earnings data and generic industry narratives. The analysis of Q1 2025 results is a standard recap of revenue and EPS beats, while the 'Business Strategy' and 'Economic Moat' sections use boilerplate language regarding switching costs and digital transformation that has been applicable to Adobe for over a decade. There is no attempt to link disparate data points (e.g., specific AI adoption rates vs. customer acquisition costs) into a new conclusion. The valuation section uses a standard DCF model with generic drivers like 'scale efficiencies' and 'AI-driven cost savings' without explaining the specific mechanisms or providing novel quantified insights. Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis and consists of at least four generic or restated insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the provided decision rules.",

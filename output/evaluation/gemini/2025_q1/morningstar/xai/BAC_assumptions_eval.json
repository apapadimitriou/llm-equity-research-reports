    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions, including a 3% revenue CAGR, a 9.5% WACC, and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. These inputs are proximal to the valuation narrative and are internally consistent with the provided financial snapshot table, which correctly reflects the projected EPS bridge and margin expansion. Specificity is solid, with clear units, time horizons (2025\u20132029), and identified causal drivers such as digital efficiencies and loan expansion. However, the quality of justification is only partial. While the report cites historical trends and GDP proxies, it relies on third-party aggregators rather than detailed multi-year historical analysis or direct peer benchmarking to support its growth and margin targets. Most critically, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers. While it mentions that macro risks could swing the valuation by 20\u201330%, it does not provide specific ranges or 'what-if' scenarios for interest rate fluctuations, net interest margins, or credit loss provisions. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair.' The report provides a clear 'black-box' output without demonstrating how the valuation would respond to changes in its primary underlying assumptions.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a 'Good' level of analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide clear causal mechanisms for its forecasts. It explains the expansion of operating margins to 32% through a \"Services mix shift (gross margins ~70%) offsetting hardware pressures\" and \"economies of scale.\" The inference quality is high, evidenced by a detailed EPS bridge that quantifies the contributions of revenue growth, margin expansion, and share buybacks to the 2025 EPS target of $8.90. Data usage is effective; the analyst benchmarks Apple\u2019s pricing power by noting \"iPhones average $800+ versus $300 for Android alternatives\" and references a \"94% customer retention rate\" to support the Wide moat rating. While the report identifies significant risks, such as regulatory scrutiny impacting \"20% of revenue,\" and provides a quantified uncertainty range stating \"valuation could swing \u00b120% on regulatory outcomes,\" it stops short of an 'Excellent' grade. This is because it lacks a formal sensitivity analysis (e.g., a WACC/growth matrix) or discrete, quantified bull/bear scenarios that model how specific changes in underlying assumptions would impact the fair value estimate. The implications are actionable, providing a clear buy recommendation based on the 0.89 Price/FVE ratio.",

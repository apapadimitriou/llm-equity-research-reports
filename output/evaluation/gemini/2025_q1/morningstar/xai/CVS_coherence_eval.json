    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report suffers from significant internal contradictions and temporal logical failures that severely undermine its coherence. Most notably, the 2025 EPS forecast is inconsistent across three different sections: the Analyst Note cites $7.40, the Fair Value section calculates $6.20, and the Financials Snapshot table lists $4.30. This discrepancy flows directly into the valuation multiples, where the report cites a 11.5x P/E in the introduction but a 13.7x P/E in the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section. Furthermore, the report contains severe temporal inaccuracies; while the report is dated May 2, 2025, it cites sources [3], [4], and [6] from July and August 2025, which is chronologically impossible. These 'future' citations suggest the report was assembled from disparate, time-inconsistent data points. While the narrative structure appears professional, the lack of reconciliation between the analyst's aggressive $7.40 EPS forecast and the company's $6.00-$6.20 guidance\u2014which the analyst explicitly claims to align with in the Fair Value section\u2014creates an unresolved tension. The reader is left to assemble the argument themselves because the core financial assumptions are fundamentally at odds with one another.",

        "\"our 2025 adjusted EPS forecast of $7.40\" (Analyst Note) vs \"yielding 2025 EPS of $6.20\" (Fair Value section) vs \"4.30\" (Financials Snapshot).",
        "Sources [4], [6], and [3] are dated July and August 2025, which post-dates the report's May 2, 2025 publication date.",
        "The report claims a P/E of 11.5x in the Analyst Note but 13.7x in the Fair Value section, both referencing the same 2025 period."

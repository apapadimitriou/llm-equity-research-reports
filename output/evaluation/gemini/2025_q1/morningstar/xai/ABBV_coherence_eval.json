    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to significant temporal inaccuracies and unresolved internal contradictions that violate the core requirements of coherence. Most notably, the report includes a citation (Source [5]) dated September 2025, which is nearly five months after the report\u2019s stated publication date of April 26, 2025. This temporal impossibility undermines the credibility of the data provided. Furthermore, the report contains a blatant contradiction regarding the company's financial health: the 'Bears Say' section warns of 'high debt from acquisitions,' yet the 'Capital Allocation' section describes the balance sheet as 'strong' with 'manageable debt.' There is no narrative effort to reconcile these conflicting statements or explain the discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, there are inconsistencies between the narrative and the supporting tables. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section states that operating margins will stabilize at 45% by 2027, but the 'Financials Snapshot' and 'Appendix' tables both forecast a continued increase to 46% by 2029. While the report's language is clear and the structural flow is generally logical, these factual and logical lapses trigger multiple auto-downgrade guardrails. The reader is left to resolve whether the company is over-leveraged or financially sound, and whether the margin expansion halts or continues, making the document internally incoherent.",
    "evidence": [
        "Source [5] is dated 2025-09-05, which post-dates the report's publication date of 2025-04-26 (Sources/Cover Block).",
        "Bears cite 'High debt' as a risk, while Capital Allocation rates the balance sheet as 'strong' with 'manageable debt' (Bulls/Bears vs Capital Allocation).",
        "Narrative projects margins 'stabilizing at 45% by 2027' but the Financials Snapshot table forecasts 46% for 2029 (Fair Value vs Financials Snapshot)."

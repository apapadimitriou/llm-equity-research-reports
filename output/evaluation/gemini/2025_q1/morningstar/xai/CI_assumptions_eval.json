    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst explicitly states key drivers such as revenue growth, margin expansion, and WACC, the internal logic fails to reconcile across different sections of the report. Specifically, there are two distinct contradictions: first, the WACC is stated as 8.0%, but the provided components (3% risk-free rate, 0.9 beta, and 6% equity risk premium) mathematically result in 8.4% via the CAPM formula. Second, the narrative in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section forecasts revenue reaching $325 billion by 2029, whereas the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly projects $335 billion for the same period. These discrepancies suggest a lack of rigor in model-to-report synchronization.\n\nFurthermore, the report fails the sensitivity requirement. While it mentions a general '+/-20% fair value band' and qualitatively discusses the impact of medical loss ratio increases, it does not provide a quantified sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis showing how changes in material drivers (like WACC, terminal growth, or margins) specifically impact the $410 fair value estimate. Justification is only partial; while it cites historical ROIC and industry growth trends, the lack of share count assumptions\u2014despite mentioning heavy buybacks\u2014leaves a significant driver of the EPS bridge opaque. Per the grading instructions, two or more contradictions necessitate a 'Poor' grade.",

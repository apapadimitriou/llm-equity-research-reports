    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying entirely on restating public earnings data and paraphrasing external sources, particularly social media summaries (Sources 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7). Every 'insight' presented is a standard market narrative: the Q1 earnings beat, the 10-for-1 stock split, the dominance of the CUDA ecosystem, and generic competition from AMD. There is no attempt to link disparate data points into a new conclusion; for example, the valuation section uses a standard DCF with consensus-aligned growth rates (35% CAGR) and generic terminal values without identifying a novel driver or company-specific mechanism. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' section repeats boilerplate industry talking points regarding AI demand and geopolitical risks. Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis and functions primarily as a summary of cited third-party commentary and news headlines, it meets the hard cap for a 'Poor' grade.",

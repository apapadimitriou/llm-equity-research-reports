    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to multiple unresolved internal contradictions and significant temporal inaccuracies that undermine the narrative's credibility. The most critical failure is the chronological impossibility: the report is dated April 16, 2025, yet the Analyst Note and several citations (e.g., Source 6) discuss Q2 2025 financial results and raised annual guidance that would not be public until July 2025. This creates a fundamental disconnect between the stated 'now' of the report and the data it purports to analyze. Furthermore, there is a stark lack of alignment between the narrative and the provided data tables. The Analyst Note explicitly states that management raised 2025 revenue guidance to $93.2\u2013$93.6 billion and EPS to $10.80\u2013$10.90. However, the Financials Snapshot table presents 2025 estimates of $92.0 billion and $10.60, respectively. This discrepancy is never addressed, leaving the reader with two conflicting sets of 'base case' assumptions. While the report maintains a professional tone and clear section headers, these structural flaws mean the reader must reconcile the argument themselves. Additionally, the Bulls/Bears sections reference an acquisition of 'Intra-Cellular Therapies' which is not reflected in the provided source list or the broader business description, suggesting a lack of internal fact-checking. These errors trigger multiple auto-downgrade guardrails regarding temporal accuracy and narrative-to-table consistency.",

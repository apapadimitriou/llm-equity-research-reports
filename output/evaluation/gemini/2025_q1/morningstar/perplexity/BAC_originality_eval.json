    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely composed of restated facts from the Q1 2025 earnings release and boilerplate company descriptions. It fails to provide any original synthesis or a unique investment thesis. Every 'insight' identified is a direct pull from public filings or earnings transcripts, such as the 300 bps operating leverage, the seventh consecutive quarter of deposit growth, and digital adoption rates. The valuation section uses standard consensus-aligned growth rates (3-4%) and efficiency targets (50-52%) without introducing a novel driver or a specific, testable mechanism. There is no attempt to link disparate data points\u2014such as macro rate paths to specific deposit beta trajectories or fee normalization\u2014into a new conclusion. Consequently, it lacks decision relevance for an institutional investor seeking value-added perspective beyond a news summary. The report relies heavily on 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' tropes and generic economic moat definitions that could apply to any major G-SIB. Without a proprietary angle on NII trajectory, credit normalization, or capital return beyond what management has already guided, the report functions as a summary rather than original research. Hard caps for zero synthesis and high counts of restated data points necessitate a 'Poor' grade.",

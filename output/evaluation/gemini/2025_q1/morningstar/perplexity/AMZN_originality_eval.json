    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original insights, functioning instead as a comprehensive summary of the provided source documents. Every major 'insight' presented\u2014including the AWS growth rates, advertising revenue surges, and the $100B CapEx plan\u2014is a direct restatement of the Q1 2025 earnings release or the provided news articles. There is no evidence of synthesis where disparate data points are linked to form a new conclusion; for example, the link between AI CapEx and future growth is a direct quote from the CEO rather than an independent analyst projection. The valuation section relies on consensus drivers (AI adoption) and standard SOTP methodology without introducing a novel mechanism or quantified catalyst. Because the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis and relies entirely on paraphrasing public headlines and boilerplate descriptions of the company's 'Wide Moat,' it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade in originality. It offers zero decision-relevant perspectives that are not already available in the cited news summaries.",

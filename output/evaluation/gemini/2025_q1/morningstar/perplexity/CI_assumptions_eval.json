    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for key value drivers, including segmented revenue growth (12-15% for Evernorth), operating margin expansion (targeting 3.2-3.5%), and a detailed WACC of 8.5%. These inputs are proximal to the forecasts and are internally consistent with the provided 'Financials Snapshot' table. Justification is solid, linking growth to the Medicare divestiture and biosimilar adoption trends. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. Although the narrative qualitatively mentions that 'stress testing scenarios indicate downside protection,' it provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges (e.g., Bull/Bear cases). Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers like the Medical Cost Ratio (MCR) or WACC necessitates a hard cap of 'Fair.' Furthermore, while the WACC is stated, the components (Cost of Equity 9-10%) are given as a range without a clear link to a specific peer group or risk-free rate source, making the justification 'solid' rather than 'comprehensive.' Internal consistency is high, with no identified numeric contradictions between the narrative and the data table, but the lack of quantified ranges for the $380 price target prevents a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",

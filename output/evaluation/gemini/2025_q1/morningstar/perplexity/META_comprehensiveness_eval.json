    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows a professional structure and includes all mandatory qualitative sections, such as a detailed ESG analysis and a clear economic moat assessment. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural issues. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot table lacks core sector-specific KPIs (ARPU, DAU/MAU, Ad Pricing/Impressions) in its multi-year forecast, providing only generic financial data (Revenue, EPS, etc.). While some of these metrics are mentioned in the text, their absence from the financial summary violates the requirement for sector-appropriate KPI integration in the snapshot. Furthermore, the report lacks quantitative peer benchmarking and a sensitivity/scenario analysis, which are prerequisites for higher grades. There is also notable redundancy; the Analyst Note, Business Description, and Risk sections repeat the same Q1 2025 performance data and Capex guidance ($64-72B) without adding incremental depth. While the valuation section attempts to link drivers to the fair value estimate, the lack of a sensitivity matrix or alternative cases limits the comprehensiveness of the valuation framework.",

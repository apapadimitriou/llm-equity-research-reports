    "reasoning": "The report maintains a professional structure and clear language, but it suffers from significant internal contradictions and temporal misalignments that undermine its coherence. The most glaring issue is the disconnect between the narrative and the financial table. The Analyst Note cites Q1 2025 revenue of $26.6 billion, which implies an annual run rate of approximately $106 billion. However, the Financials Snapshot table estimates FY 2025 revenue at $198.2 billion. This discrepancy is never addressed, leaving the reader to reconcile a nearly $90 billion gap in expectations. Furthermore, the table shows a massive revenue jump from $115.1 billion in 2022 to $171.9 billion in 2023, a 49% increase that is entirely unexplained in the business strategy or analyst sections.\n\nTemporally, the report is dated April 16, 2025, yet both the Analyst Note and the Capital Allocation section rely on a CET1 ratio of 11.9% 'as of March 2024.' Using data that is over a year old in a report that claims to cover Q1 2025 results is a major oversight. While the sections are logically ordered and the language is smooth, these data conflicts violate the requirement for a connected argument. The Bulls/Bears sections are presented as isolated lists and are not proactively reconciled with the base-case valuation, which further limits the report to a 'fair' grade under the provided rubric.",

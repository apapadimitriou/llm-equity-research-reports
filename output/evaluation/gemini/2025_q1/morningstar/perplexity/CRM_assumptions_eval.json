    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for key valuation drivers, including revenue growth, operating margins, WACC, and terminal growth, primarily located in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' and 'Appendix' sections. Specificity is a strength, with clear magnitudes (e.g., 12% growth, 35-36% peak margins) and time horizons (FY27-FY28). However, justification is only partial; while the report links growth to 'Agentforce adoption,' it lacks rigorous multi-year historical benchmarking or peer comparisons to support the 12% growth forecast, which notably exceeds current management guidance of 8-9%. Internal consistency is mostly maintained, but a numeric contradiction exists: the financial snapshot table calculates to 11.04% revenue growth for FY29, which conflicts with the narrative's claim that growth moderates to '8-10% thereafter' (post-FY27). Most critically, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like WACC or margin expansion, offering only qualitative risk descriptions. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivities and the presence of a numeric inconsistency between the text and tables limit the grade to 'Fair'.",

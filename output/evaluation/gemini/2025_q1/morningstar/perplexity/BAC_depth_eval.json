    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive statistics to explain the underlying drivers of profitability. It provides a clear causal link for margin expansion, citing 'operating leverage of 300 basis points as revenue grew faster than expenses.' Assumptions are not merely stated but are benchmarked against regulatory requirements and historical performance, such as the 'CET1 ratio of 11.9%... above regulatory minimum' and the 'Efficiency ratio trending toward 50-52% from current levels of... 53%.' Crucially, the report includes a quantified scenario analysis in the appendix, providing specific ranges for key drivers like 'Normalized Credit Losses: 45 bps | 35 bps | 65 bps' and 'Revenue CAGR 2025-29: 3.5% | 5.0% | 2.0%.' This allows investors to understand the sensitivity of the valuation to different economic outcomes. While some causal links regarding technology are slightly generic, the overall integration of benchmarked data, explicit multi-scenario forecasts, and clear decision-relevant implications (Fair Value of $52.00) meets the criteria for an Excellent grade.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows a professional structure and includes all required sections, but it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' thresholds due to specific omissions in sector-specific data and quantitative analysis. While the narrative mentions 'debt issuance' and 'recurring revenue,' the Financials Snapshot table is limited to generic accounting metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF, ROIC) and omits critical sector-specific KPIs such as Assets Linked to Indices (AUM), Billed Issuance Volume, and Retention Rates. Per the 'Hard Caps' in the instructions, the absence of \u22652 core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot mandates a 'Fair' grade. Additionally, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking table and a quantitative scenario/sensitivity analysis. There is also significant redundancy, as the 'Mobility segment separation' is repeated across five different sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, and Capital Allocation) without providing substantial new depth in each instance, which triggers a downgrade under the redundancy rule.",

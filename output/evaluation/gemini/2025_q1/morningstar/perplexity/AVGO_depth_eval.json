    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates excellent analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to explain the underlying economic engines of the business. It provides a clear causal mechanism for margin expansion, attributing it to a \"mix contribution\" shift toward high-margin AI and software segments. The inference quality is high, linking a specific \"AI serviceable addressable market\" of \"$60-90 billion by fiscal 2027\" to future revenue trajectories. Data use is robust, featuring quantified assumptions for WACC (\"8-9%\") and terminal growth (\"3%\"). Most notably, the report includes a comprehensive scenario analysis in the appendix, quantifying \"Bull,\" \"Base,\" and \"Bear\" cases across five key variables, including \"AI Revenue CAGR\" and \"Operating Margin.\" While the report contains a significant internal discrepancy between the cover block fair value ($912) and the valuation section ($350-400), the reasoning within the valuation section is explicitly tied to a \"25-30x forward earnings multiple.\" The treatment of uncertainty is thorough, identifying \"customer concentration risk\" and \"geopolitical tensions\" as specific conditional hurdles. Actionable implications are present, framing the investment thesis around \"execution on management's ambitious projections.\" Verbatim excerpts: \"Operating margin expansion... as AI and software revenues increase... mix\"; \"AI Revenue CAGR (2025-2027) Base 65% | Bull 85% | Bear 45%\"; \"custom silicon design capabilities create high switching costs\"; \"WACC estimated at 8-9%\"; \"Fair value estimate of approximately $350-400 per share.\"",

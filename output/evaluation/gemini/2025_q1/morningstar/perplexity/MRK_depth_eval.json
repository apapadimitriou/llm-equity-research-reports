    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides clear causal reasoning for specific performance drivers, notably attributing the Gardasil decline to 'ongoing demand weakness in China where economic pressures have affected the cash-pay HPV vaccine market.' It offers quantified forecasts for key assets, stating 'Keytruda sales are projected to peak at approximately $41 billion in 2028.' However, the report is limited by its treatment of valuation assumptions. While it explicitly lists 'WACC: 8.2%' and 'Terminal growth: 2.5%,' these figures are neither benchmarked against industry peers nor stress-tested. The report mentions a 'revenue erosion of 30-60%' for Keytruda post-2028, but it fails to provide a quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based Fair Value Estimates (e.g., a Bear Case valuation). Because the assumptions are listed but not benchmarked or stress-tested, the report meets the criteria for a 'Fair' grade under the specified hard caps. The implications are actionable, noting the stock 'trades at approximately 76% of estimated fair value,' but the lack of quantified sensitivity for the valuation model limits its analytical depth.",

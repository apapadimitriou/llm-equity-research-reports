    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. However, it fails to meet the technical depth required for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to two primary omissions. First, the Financials Snapshot table is generic; while it includes standard financial metrics like Revenue and EPS, it omits the two most critical sector-specific KPIs for an asset manager: Assets Under Management (AUM) and Net Inflows. Per the grading instructions, the absence of \u22652 core sector KPIs in the snapshot (AUM and Net Inflows) triggers a hard cap at 'Fair.' Second, the report lacks any specific peer benchmarking or scenario/sensitivity analysis. While the text mentions market trends and strategic acquisitions (GIP, HPS), it does not provide a comparative analysis against direct competitors like State Street or Vanguard. The valuation section provides a high-level link between AUM growth and fair value but lacks the explicit bridge or sensitivity tables expected in professional-grade research. Consequently, despite the consistent sourcing and clear writing, the report remains at a 'Fair' level.",

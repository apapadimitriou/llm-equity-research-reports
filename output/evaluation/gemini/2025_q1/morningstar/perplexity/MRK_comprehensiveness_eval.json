    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report adheres to the required structural framework and provides a professional overview of Merck\u2019s strategic position. However, it fails to achieve a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to several critical omissions and structural flaws. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks essential sector-specific KPIs for a Biopharma firm, such as R&D expense, R&D as a percentage of sales, and granular revenue forecasts for Keytruda and Gardasil\u2014the company's primary value drivers. While the valuation section identifies drivers, it lacks a numerical sensitivity or scenario analysis (e.g., a table showing the impact of varying WACC or patent erosion rates). Peer benchmarking is mentioned qualitatively but lacks a comparative data table (P/E, Pipeline size, or Margin vs. peers). Furthermore, the report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating the '2028 Keytruda patent cliff' and 'China Gardasil weakness' across nearly every section without adding substantial new depth, which triggers a mandatory downgrade per the instruction rules.",

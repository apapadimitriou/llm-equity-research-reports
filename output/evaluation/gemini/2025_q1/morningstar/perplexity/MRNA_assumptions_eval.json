    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a solid foundation of explicit and specific assumptions, particularly regarding revenue ranges for key products (Spikevax, mRESVIA) and margin trajectories. These inputs are proximal to the forecasts and reconcile with the provided financial snapshot table. Justification is partial; while the report cites management guidance and competitive market share data (e.g., GSK's 69% share), the 9.5% WACC is stated without a formal build-up or peer benchmark. The most significant deficiency is the lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. Although the report mentions a 'probability-weighted analysis' and provides 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' qualitative arguments, it fails to provide a sensitivity matrix or specific valuation ranges (e.g., Bull/Bear price targets) for material drivers like R&D success rates or market penetration. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers caps the grade at 'Fair.' Internal consistency is high, with no numeric contradictions found between the narrative and the financial table, and the 2025 revenue estimate of $2.0B sits squarely within the cited guidance range.",

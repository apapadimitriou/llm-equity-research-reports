    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded as poor due to severe internal contradictions, temporal inaccuracies, and incompleteness. Most notably, there is a significant chronological mismatch: the report is dated May 29, 2024, yet it cites a market capitalization of $4.09 trillion and a stock price of $168.31. In reality, NVIDIA's market cap did not approach the $4 trillion milestone until late 2024 or early 2025, making the data in the Cover Block factually impossible relative to the Analyst Note's focus on Q1 FY25 results (ending April 2024). \n\nFurthermore, the report is structurally broken. It includes a Table of Contents that promises a 'Financials Snapshot,' 'ESG Risk,' 'Appendix,' and 'Sources,' but none of these sections appear in the document. The narrative itself terminates abruptly in the middle of a sentence within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section ('...well above historical levels for traditional'), leaving the core valuation argument unfinished. While the individual narrative sections like the Analyst Note and Business Strategy are written with clear language, the total absence of the promised data tables and the failure to reconcile the valuation figures with the report's timeframe force the reader to assemble the context themselves. These unresolved tensions between the provided dates and the cited financial facts constitute a total failure of coherence.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report Date: 2024-05-29 vs Market Cap: $4.09T (Cover Block); the valuation is chronologically inconsistent with the report date.",
        "The text ends mid-sentence: '...well above historical levels for traditional' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers).",
        "Sections for Financials Snapshot, ESG Risk, and Sources are listed in the Contents but entirely missing from the body."

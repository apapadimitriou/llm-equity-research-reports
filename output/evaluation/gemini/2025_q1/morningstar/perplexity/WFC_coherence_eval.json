    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is well-organized and uses professional terminology, but it is severely hampered by temporal inaccuracies and internal data contradictions. The most glaring issue is the citation of 'Q2 2025' revenue figures in the Business Description, despite the report being dated April 12, 2025. Financial results for the second quarter would not be available until July, making this claim factually impossible within the report's own timeline. Additionally, the Analyst Note refers to the resolution of the Federal Reserve asset cap as an event expected in the 'first quarter of 2025.' Because the report is dated in the second quarter (April), this phrasing is time-inaccurate; it treats a past period as a future or ongoing expectation without confirming the outcome. There is also a notable lack of consistency regarding data recency. While the report successfully incorporates Q1 2025 earnings data, the Capital Allocation section relies on CET1 ratios from Q2 2024. This reliance on year-old data, when more recent figures should be available given the Q1 2025 earnings beat mentioned elsewhere, creates an 'internally noisy' argument. While the narrative flow is generally smooth and the Bulls/Bears are reconciled within the valuation section, these chronological failures and impossible citations trigger the mandatory 'fair' cap for contradictions and temporal inaccuracies.",
    "evidence": [
        "generated $20.8 billion in quarterly revenue as of Q2 2025 (Business Description) - Impossible data point for a report dated April 12, 2025.",
        "expecting possible resolution in the first quarter of 2025 (Analyst Note) - Fails to reconcile a past-due expectation with the report's Q2 2025 date.",
        "CET1 ratio of 11.0% as of Q2 2024 (Capital Allocation) - Uses year-old data despite the report claiming to analyze Q1 2025 results."

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by providing clear causal mechanisms for Amazon\u2019s performance rather than merely describing results. It attributes AWS growth to \"triple-digit expansion in artificial intelligence workloads\" and explains the advertising segment's success through the \"intersection of e-commerce and marketing technology.\" The author provides a comprehensive set of explicit, quantified assumptions, including a \"WACC of 9.5% and terminal growth rate of 3%,\" and benchmarks the valuation against a \"2025 enterprise value to sales multiple of 4.0x.\" Inference quality is high, with segment-level forecasts (e.g., \"AWS Revenue Growth 18%\") tied to structural drivers like \"enterprise digital transformation.\" The report includes a dedicated \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section and a \"Risk & Uncertainty\" analysis, addressing counterpoints such as the \"FTC antitrust case\" which \"could result in operational restrictions.\" However, the report fails to reach \"Excellent\" because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges. While it identifies risks, it does not model how specific changes in key variables (like a 1% change in WACC or a slowdown in AI spend) would impact the $250 fair value estimate. The implications are actionable but lack the conditional quantification required for the highest grade.",

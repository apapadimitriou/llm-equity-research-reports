    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong structural coherence and professional prose, but it is undermined by critical temporal contradictions. The most glaring issue is the inclusion of sources dated August and September 2025 (Sources [3], [12], [17]) within a report dated May 29, 2025. This internal inconsistency suggests a failure in data verification or a synthesis of mismatched datasets. Additionally, there is a narrative lag regarding earnings. The report is dated May 29, 2025, and the Strategy section correctly references Q2 2025 results released on May 28. However, the 'Analyst Note'\u2014intended to be the most current thesis update\u2014focuses almost entirely on Q1 2025 results from February. This creates a 'choppy' temporal flow where the lead argument feels three months out of date compared to the data available elsewhere in the document. Minor numerical tensions also exist; the Analyst Note cites a 44x trailing P/E, but the provided stock price ($609.08) and 2024A EPS ($14.78) result in a 41.2x multiple. While the Bulls/Bears are effectively reconciled with the valuation and the sections are well-linked, the temporal inaccuracies regarding the report date versus source dates trigger a mandatory downgrade to 'fair' per the grading guardrails.",
    "evidence": [
        "Report date is May 29, 2025, yet Sources [3], [12], and [17] are dated August and September 2025 (Sources Section).",
        "Analyst Note focuses on Q1 2025 results (Feb) as the primary update, despite the report date being one day after Q2 2025 results were released (Analyst Note vs Strategy/Outlook).",
        "Analyst Note claims a 44x trailing P/E, which contradicts the 41.2x multiple derived from the Cover Block price and Financials Snapshot 2024A EPS."

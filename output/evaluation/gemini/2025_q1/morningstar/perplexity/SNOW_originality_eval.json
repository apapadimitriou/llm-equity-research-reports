    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a summary of public financial filings and management's stated strategy rather than an original piece of equity research. It fails to provide any synthesis or original thesis as defined in the instructions. Every 'insight' identified is either a restatement of Q1 2026 financial results (revenue, RPO, NRR), a repetition of the company's own marketing narrative regarding 'Cortex AI,' or a generic industry observation regarding competition with Databricks. The valuation section is particularly boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF inputs (WACC, terminal growth) without identifying a single novel driver or company-specific mechanism that would differentiate this analysis from a basic financial aggregator. There is no attempt to link disparate data points\u2014such as specific customer cohort behavior or workload migration patterns\u2014to a unique margin or revenue trajectory. Consequently, the report offers zero decision-relevant originality and relies entirely on public headlines and standard sector tropes.",

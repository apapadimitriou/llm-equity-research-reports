    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all mandatory sections including the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Capital Allocation. It provides a clear narrative regarding Biogen's transition from its legacy MS franchise to new growth drivers like Leqembi and Skyclarys. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to the generic nature of the Financials Snapshot. While the text discusses specific drug sales and pipeline potential, the financial table itself omits core sector-specific KPIs such as drug-level revenue forecasts (e.g., Leqembi vs. MS franchise breakdown) and pipeline progression metrics (e.g., Phase III trial counts), which are essential for biopharma equity research. Additionally, while the report mentions peer multiples (Regeneron, Vertex) and includes a brief sensitivity range in the text, it lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking table and a structured scenario analysis table, both of which are required for higher grades. The valuation section successfully links operating drivers to the fair value outcome, but the lack of granular data in the financials section prevents a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",

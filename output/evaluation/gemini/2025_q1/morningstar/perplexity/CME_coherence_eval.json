    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'fair' grade due to significant internal contradictions and temporal logic failures that trigger mandatory guardrail caps. While the narrative is professionally structured and uses clear language, it fails to reconcile its own data points. Specifically, the Analyst Note reports a Q1 2025 operating margin of 71%, yet the Financials Snapshot table forecasts a lower full-year 2025 margin of 69.0%, despite the narrative describing a 'record' environment. Furthermore, a major contradiction exists regarding revenue: the Analyst Note cites Q1 revenue of $1.6 billion (a $6.4 billion annual run rate), which matches the FY 2025E table value exactly, implying 0% growth for the remainder of the year. This directly conflicts with the Fair Value section, which explicitly projects 'revenue growth of 8-10% annually.' Most critically, the report suffers from a temporal impossibility. It is dated April 24, 2025, yet it cites an 'Investor Presentation, July 2025' (Source 15) and references a 'July 2025' yield in the Bulls Say section. This suggests the report was compiled using future-dated or inconsistent templates, undermining the credibility of the 'recent' claims. While the business description and moat analysis are coherent, these quantitative and temporal mismatches require the reader to resolve conflicting data, preventing a higher grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple significant internal contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly lists key assumptions such as WACC (7.5%), Terminal Growth (2.5%), and Revenue CAGR (8.9%), these figures fail to reconcile with the provided 'Financials Snapshot' table. Specifically, the table's revenue figures ($42.5B in 2025E to $55.9B in 2029E) imply a CAGR of approximately 7.1%, directly contradicting the 8.9% stated in the Appendix and the '8-10%' range in the narrative. Furthermore, the report cites a target 'efficiency ratio in the low-40% range' while the table lists 'Op-Margin %' climbing from 43.9% to 47.2%. In banking, these are distinct metrics; if the table intended to show efficiency, the numbers are outside the 'low-40%' target, and if it intended to show margins, the implied efficiency ratio (the complement) would be in the 50s, creating a major conceptual conflict. Additionally, the valuation logic is flawed: a 14.3x P/E on $15.45 EPS yields the stated $221 price, but this does not align with the $141.67B market cap without an unexplained 68% increase in share count post-merger. Finally, the report offers only qualitative risk discussion, failing the requirement for quantified sensitivity ranges for material drivers like NIM or credit losses.",

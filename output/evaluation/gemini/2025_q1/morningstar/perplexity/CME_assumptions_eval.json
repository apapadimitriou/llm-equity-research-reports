    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment primarily due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. While the report explicitly lists key valuation inputs in the appendix and narrative, these figures frequently conflict with the provided 'Financials Snapshot' table. Specifically, the narrative forecasts adjusted EPS growth of 10\u201312% annually, yet the table\u2019s data for 2024A ($9.7) to 2025E ($10.3) reflects only 6.2% growth, and 2025E to 2026E reflects 8.7%. Similarly, the text claims operating margins will remain 'above 70%,' but the table explicitly estimates the 2025 margin at 69.0%. These discrepancies violate the consistency pillar and trigger the 'Poor' hard cap for having two or more distinct contradictions. Furthermore, the report lacks quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers such as trading volumes (ADV) or interest rate impacts. Although it provides a range for the final Fair Value ($260\u2013$305), it does not demonstrate how changes in specific inputs (e.g., a 1% change in WACC or a 5% drop in volume) impact the valuation. Finally, justification for critical parameters like the 8.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth rate is absent; these are presented as point estimates without reference to historical averages, peer benchmarks, or cost-of-equity build-ups, rendering the model's foundation opaque.",

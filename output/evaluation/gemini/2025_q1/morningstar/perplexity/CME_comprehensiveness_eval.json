    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all mandatory sections from the Analyst Note to ESG. However, it fails to reach a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to two primary deficiencies. First, the Financials Snapshot table is generic; it omits critical sector-specific KPIs such as Average Daily Volume (ADV) and Revenue per Contract (RPC) in its multi-year forecast, relying instead on standard accounting metrics (Revenue, EPS). Per the grading rubric, the omission of \u22652 core sector KPIs in the snapshot caps the grade at 'Fair.' Second, the report lacks any peer benchmarking or competitive context against rivals like ICE, Nasdaq, or Cboe, which necessitates a one-level downgrade. While the valuation section mentions drivers like volume expansion, the linkage is relatively high-level and lacks a formal sensitivity matrix. The report also exhibits minor redundancy, repeating volume statistics across the Analyst Note, Business Description, and Moat sections without adding incremental depth.",

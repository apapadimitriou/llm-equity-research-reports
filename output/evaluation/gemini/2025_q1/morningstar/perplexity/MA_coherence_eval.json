    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural coherence, with a logical progression from high-level summaries to detailed thematic analysis. The language is professional, and the Analyst Note effectively synthesizes the core investment thesis, reconciling the 'Wide Moat' status with valuation concerns. Financial metrics are largely consistent across the narrative and the Financials Snapshot; for instance, the 2024 revenue of $28.2 billion and the 18% cross-border volume growth are cited accurately in multiple sections. However, the report suffers from a critical temporal contradiction that triggers a mandatory downgrade. The document is dated May 2, 2025, but it incorporates 'Last Close' pricing and multiple citations (Sources 4, 6, 11, and 12) from September 2025. This logical impossibility\u2014citing data from four months after the report was supposedly written\u2014severely compromises the integrity of the 'recent' claims. Furthermore, there is a minor internal tension regarding profitability: the narrative repeatedly highlights 'sustained operating margins above 55%,' yet the provided table forecasts a decline to 54.5% for the 2025 fiscal year without explaining this projected dip. While the transitions between sections like 'Economic Moat' and 'Fair Value' are smooth and the terminology is used consistently, the temporal misalignment between the report's publication date and its evidence base is an unaddressed contradiction that caps the grade at fair.",

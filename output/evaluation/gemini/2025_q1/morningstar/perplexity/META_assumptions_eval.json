    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions test primarily due to a material internal contradiction and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly states key drivers such as WACC (10.5%), terminal growth (2.5%), and 2025 capex ($64\u201372B), these figures are presented as static points without ranges or scenario-based impacts on the $770 fair value estimate. Crucially, there is a significant numeric discrepancy: the narrative explicitly forecasts a 12% revenue CAGR over the next five years, yet the provided 'Financials Snapshot' table reflects a CAGR of only approximately 9.7% when calculating the growth from 2024 ($156.8B) to 2029 ($249.7B). Justification for these inputs is limited to recent quarterly performance and management guidance, lacking the multi-year historical context or peer benchmarking required for a higher grade. Per the grading rubric, the combination of a numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities for material drivers (such as AI capex or ad pricing) mandates a 'Poor' grade.",

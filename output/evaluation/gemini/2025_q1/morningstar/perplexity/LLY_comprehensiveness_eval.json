    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a structured overview of Eli Lilly\u2019s current market position, particularly focusing on the high-growth GLP-1 franchise (Mounjaro and Zepbound). While it includes all required sections and maintains a professional, data-driven tone with consistent citations, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in the quantitative analysis. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks at least two core sector-specific KPIs: R&D expenditure (the primary driver of pharmaceutical value) and leverage ratios such as Net Debt/EBITDA. Furthermore, while the report mentions competitors like Novo Nordisk, it lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or table to compare relative performance or valuation. The valuation section successfully links operating drivers (revenue CAGR and margin expansion) to the fair value estimate, but the absence of a scenario or sensitivity analysis further limits its comprehensiveness. Per the grading instructions, the omission of multiple core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot triggers a hard cap at the 'Fair' level, despite the report's strong narrative and sourcing.",

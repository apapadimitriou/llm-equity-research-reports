    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns a 'Good' grade due to its high degree of explicitness and specificity regarding key model inputs. Assumptions for revenue growth (3\u20134% CAGR), efficiency ratios (50\u201352%), and credit loss normalization (40\u201350 bps) are clearly stated within the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, proximal to the forecasts they inform. The report demonstrates strong internal consistency; for example, the 3.5% CAGR derived from the 'Financials Snapshot' table aligns perfectly with the 3\u20134% range cited in the narrative. Furthermore, the report avoids the 'Fair' cap by providing a robust, quantified sensitivity analysis in the Appendix, covering five material drivers (Revenue CAGR, Peak ROE, Credit Losses, Efficiency Ratio, and Terminal Multiple) across Base, Bull, and Bear scenarios. It falls short of 'Excellent' because the justification for these assumptions is primarily narrative-based (citing management guidance and general Fed policy) rather than evidence-rich. It lacks specific multi-year historical data tables or peer benchmarking figures to validate why the 1.4x terminal P/TBV multiple or the 50% efficiency target is appropriate relative to the bank's long-term cycle or its competitors. Additionally, while a Dividend Discount Model is mentioned, the specific Cost of Equity (COE) or WACC percentage is omitted.",

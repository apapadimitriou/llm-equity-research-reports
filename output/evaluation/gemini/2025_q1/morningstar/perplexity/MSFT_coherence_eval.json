    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a high degree of structural and narrative coherence, reading as a single, connected argument rather than a collection of disparate sections. It successfully integrates real-time financial data\u2014specifically the Q3 2025 results\u2014with forward-looking projections in the Financials Snapshot. Transitions between sections are logical and explicit; for instance, the 'Business Strategy' section's focus on massive AI infrastructure is directly quantified and reconciled in the 'Capital Allocation' and 'Risk' sections, which both cite the $80 billion fiscal 2025 investment figure. The 'Bulls/Bears' section is effectively reconciled with the base-case valuation narrative, acknowledging the high P/E multiple of 36\u201338x as a bear concern while justifying it in the 'Fair Value' section as a premium for competitive positioning. Terminology is precise and consistent, correctly distinguishing between 'Microsoft Cloud' and 'Azure' growth rates. Temporal claims are highly accurate relative to the May 1, 2025, report date, correctly identifying Q3 2025 as the most recent reporting period. The document avoids 'bullet dumps,' maintaining professional analytical prose throughout. Furthermore, the financial table is internally consistent with narrative claims regarding a 13% revenue CAGR and margin expansion to 46%. The alignment between cited sources and narrative claims is robust, particularly regarding the environmental impact of AI data centers and the financial impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"Q3 2025 revenue of $70.1 billion... operating income expanded 16% to $32.0 billion\" (Analyst Note) matches the \"Recent quarterly results\" narrative and the May 2025 report date.",
        "\"fiscal 2025 investments of approximately $20 billion per quarter\" (Capital Allocation) aligns perfectly with the \"$80 billion in fiscal 2025\" claim in the Risk & Uncertainty section.",
        "The 13% revenue CAGR assumption and 46% target operating margin in the \"Fair Value\" section are consistently applied to the \"Financials Snapshot\" table projections through FY 2029E."

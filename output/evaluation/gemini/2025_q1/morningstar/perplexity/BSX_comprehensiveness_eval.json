    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers all required qualitative sections, including a clear business description, strategy outlook, and a robust risk assessment. However, it is subject to a 'Fair' grade cap due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and a lack of formal peer benchmarking. While the report mentions organic growth and R&D investment within the narrative text, these core sector-specific KPIs for the Medical Technology industry are missing from the Financials Snapshot table, which remains generic (Revenue, EPS, FCF). Per the instruction's hard caps, the omission of two or more core sector KPIs in the snapshot necessitates a 'Fair' grade. Furthermore, while the report identifies competitors like Medtronic and Abbott in the 'Bears Say' and 'Risk' sections, it lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking analysis or comparative data table to evaluate Boston Scientific's relative performance. The valuation section successfully links operating drivers, such as the FARAPULSE launch and margin expansion, to the fair value estimate, and includes a sensitivity range. However, the report exhibits notable redundancy; the $8 billion market opportunity for FARAPULSE and its FDA approval status are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Bulls Say sections with minimal additional depth, which triggers a downgrade under the redundancy rule.",

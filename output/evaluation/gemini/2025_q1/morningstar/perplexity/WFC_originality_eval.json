    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a comprehensive summary of public filings and management guidance but fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis. Every 'insight' identified is a restatement of publicly available data: the 1-3% NII guidance, the $54.2 billion expense target, and the $12 billion in historical cost savings are all direct recaps of management's Q1 2025 earnings presentation. The discussion of the Federal Reserve asset cap is a standard consensus narrative with no unique quantification of the post-cap balance sheet trajectory. Furthermore, the 'Economic Moat' and 'Bulls vs. Bears' sections utilize boilerplate industry language regarding 'switching costs' and 'scale' that could apply to any large-cap bank. The valuation section lacks a novel driver, relying on standard price-to-tangible book value multiples. Per the decision rules, the absence of any original synthesis or testable thesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a clear and explicit set of base-case assumptions, particularly in the Appendix and the Financials Snapshot table. These are well-justified by referencing 2024 historical performance (e.g., 12% revenue growth and 18% cross-border volume) and are highly specific with defined units and time horizons (through 2027). Internal consistency is strong; the projected CAGR in the narrative aligns with the numerical values in the financial table. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' requirement. While it identifies material drivers for sensitivity (cross-border volume, value-added services), it only discusses them qualitatively. There are no quantified scenarios, bull/bear cases, or sensitivity tables showing the impact of varying these drivers on the Fair Value Estimate. Per the grading rubric's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers limits the maximum possible grade to 'Fair.' Additionally, while the report provides a Fair Value Estimate of $626.19, it fails to disclose the specific WACC or Cost of Equity used in the discounted cash flow or valuation model, leaving the discount rate opaque. Despite these omissions, the core operating assumptions are proximal to the forecasts and reconcile with the provided financial snapshot, preventing a 'Poor' grade.",

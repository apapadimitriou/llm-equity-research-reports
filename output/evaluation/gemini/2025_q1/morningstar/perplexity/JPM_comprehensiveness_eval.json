    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all mandatory sections and maintains a professional tone with consistent in-text citations. However, it is heavily penalized for its Financials Snapshot, which utilizes generic corporate metrics (Revenue, Op Margin, FCF, ROIC) rather than sector-appropriate banking KPIs. Essential metrics such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Loan Loss Provisions, and the Efficiency Ratio are absent from the data table, although some are mentioned sporadically in the text. Furthermore, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking analysis, providing only vague qualitative comparisons. The valuation section, while identifying profit drivers like NII and IB fees, fails to provide an explicit mathematical bridge or sensitivity analysis linking these drivers to the final fair value estimate. These omissions, particularly the lack of sector-specific financial data in the snapshot and the absence of peer context, trigger the hard caps for a 'Fair' rating.",

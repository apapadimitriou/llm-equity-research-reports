    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural coherence and professional tone, but it is undermined by significant internal contradictions and temporal inaccuracies. The narrative flow is strong; for instance, the \"Business Strategy & Outlook\" section's discussion of the Mobility segment separation is logically carried through to the \"Fair Value and Profit Drivers\" section, where it is cited as a catalyst for margin expansion. However, a major quantitative contradiction exists: the Analyst Note explicitly forecasts 2025 non-GAAP EPS growth of 35\u201337%, but the \"Financials Snapshot\" table lists 2024A EPS at $12.35 and 2025E EPS at $16.10. This represents only 30.4% growth, leaving a significant gap between the text and the supporting data. Additionally, the report suffers from a chronological impossibility. While the report is dated April 30, 2025, the \"Sources\" section (Source 5) cites an earnings report from July 31, 2025. This \"future\" citation violates the internal logic of the report's timeframe. Furthermore, both the Bulls/Bears and Appendix sections function as bullet dumps without narrative transitions, triggering a level reduction. Per the grading instructions, these unaddressed contradictions and time-inaccurate claims trigger a hard cap at the \"fair\" level. Despite these flaws, the report uses consistent terminology and provides a clear, connected argument regarding the company's wide moat and strategic refocusing.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a comprehensive summary of public information rather than a source of original equity research. It fails to provide any unique syntheses or original theses, relying instead on restating management's public guidance and well-known industry narratives. Specifically, the 'insights' regarding the Ansys acquisition (TAM expansion to $28B, $400M in synergies) and margin expansion (125 bps improvement) are direct excerpts from company press releases and merger filings. The discussion of AI tailwinds and China-related geopolitical risks uses boilerplate phrasing common to the sector. There is no evidence of the author linking disparate data points\u2014such as specific R&D efficiency metrics or peer-relative pricing power\u2014to form a new conclusion. The valuation section is generic, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (3% terminal growth, 9.5% WACC) without introducing novel drivers or proprietary mechanisms. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or testable theses beyond what is publicly available in investor decks, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the provided decision rules.",

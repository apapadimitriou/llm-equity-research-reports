    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is professionally structured and provides a clear synthesis of Meta's Q1 2025 performance, yet it is capped at 'fair' due to multiple internal contradictions and temporal inaccuracies. The most prominent contradiction involves the share repurchase program: the Cover Block and Analyst Note specify a $50 billion authorization, while the Capital Allocation section later references an 'authorization for additional $80 billion,' leaving the reader to guess the actual total. Similarly, Reality Labs' financial impact is inconsistently reported; the Analyst Note cites a $4.2 billion quarterly loss (~$16.8 billion annualized), while the Bears and Risk sections cite $17.7 billion and $18 billion respectively without reconciling these figures or clarifying if they refer to different fiscal years.\n\nTemporally, the report describes workforce reductions of 5% as 'recent' (ESG Risk), yet the cited source [20] refers to events that occurred significantly prior to the May 2025 report date. Structurally, while the narrative flow from strategy to valuation is logical, the ESG Risk section functions as a list of disconnected points rather than a cohesive argument. The report successfully reconciles the 'Bulls/Bears' tension regarding AI capex by framing it as a strategic necessity in the Analyst Note. However, the quantitative discrepancies between the narrative and the specific section details violate the requirement for internal consistency, necessitating the 'fair' grade under the provided guardrails.",

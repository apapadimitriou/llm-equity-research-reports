    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails primarily on internal consistency and logical coherence, triggering the 'Hard Cap' for multiple distinct contradictions. First, there is a massive discrepancy in the Fair Value Estimate (FVE): the Cover Block lists $912.00 (Price/FVE 0.30), while the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section explicitly calculates a range of $350\u2013400 based on a 25\u201330x forward multiple. Second, the 'Financials Snapshot' contains a mathematical impossibility: it projects EPS to leap from $1.60 in 2024A to $6.29 in 2025E (a 293% increase) despite revenue only growing 22% and operating margins expanding by only 1.6 percentage points. Third, the narrative is internally conflicted; the Cover Block implies the stock is a deep-value play (0.30 Price/FVE), yet the 'Bears Say' section warns that 'high valuation multiples leave little room for execution missteps.' While the report provides a quantified sensitivity table in the appendix\u2014which would normally elevate it\u2014the presence of three major numeric and narrative contradictions necessitates a 'Poor' grade under the evaluation rules.",

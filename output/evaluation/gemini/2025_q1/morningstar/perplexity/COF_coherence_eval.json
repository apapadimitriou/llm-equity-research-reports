    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong structural coherence and professional language, effectively linking the strategic rationale of the Discover merger across the valuation, risk, and capital allocation sections. It maintains a clear narrative arc from the Q1 2025 earnings beat to the long-term integration strategy. However, the document contains a significant temporal contradiction that triggers a mandatory downgrade under the provided guardrails. The report is dated April 23, 2025, yet the Analyst Note and Business Description sections state that the Discover acquisition 'completed on May 18, 2025' and that the segment 'now includes' Discover operations. Describing a future event (relative to the report date) in the past tense as a completed fact creates a logical impossibility that undermines the document's credibility. Beyond this temporal flaw, the internal consistency between the narrative and the financial table is generally high. The narrative successfully explains the projected 2025 EPS dip ($15.45 vs. $16.85 in 2024) as a result of integration costs, reconciling the 'Bears Say' section with the 'Financials Snapshot.' The transitions between sections are logical, and the terminology remains consistent throughout. However, because the report treats a future merger completion as a historical fact existing 'now' in April, it cannot be graded higher than fair.",

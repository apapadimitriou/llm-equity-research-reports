    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are explicitly stated and specific in terms of magnitudes and time horizons, but they fail on the critical pillars of consistency and sensitivity. While the analyst provides a clear list of drivers\u2014including a 7% revenue CAGR, a 42% terminal operating margin, and an 8.5% WACC\u2014there are significant internal contradictions. The narrative explicitly projects a 2027 EPS of $19.50 to support the $587 fair value target, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table lists the 2027 EPS as $18.85. Additionally, the text cites 2025 non-GAAP EPS growth guidance of 35\u201337%, but the provided financial table shows growth of only 30.3% ($12.35 to $16.10). These unresolved numeric discrepancies undermine the auditability of the model. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While it qualitatively discusses risks and 'Bulls/Bears' scenarios, it fails to provide quantified ranges or valuation impacts for material drivers like interest rates or issuance volumes. Justification is also relatively weak, relying on broad mentions of management guidance without presenting the multi-year historical context or peer benchmarks necessary to validate the aggressive margin expansion and growth targets. Per the grading rubric, the combination of multiple distinct contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

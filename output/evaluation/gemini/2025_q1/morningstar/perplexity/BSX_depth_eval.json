    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to provide clear causal mechanisms and quantified forecasts. It explicitly links margin expansion (50-75 bps annually) to \"manufacturing efficiency improvements\" and \"product mix optimization.\" Inference quality is strong, with revenue growth tied to the specific adoption curve of the FARAPULSE system in the \"$8 billion global atrial fibrillation ablation market.\" Data use is robust, benchmarking the 28x P/E against a \"peer group average of 25x\" and providing a \"price-to-sales ratio of 6.8x\" as a sanity check. Uncertainty is addressed through a detailed \"Risk & Uncertainty\" section and a quantified sensitivity analysis that \"indicates fair value ranges from $115-135 per share\" based on growth and margin assumptions. The report also quantifies specific headwinds, such as the \"anticipated $200 million tariff impact in 2025,\" which adds a layer of realism to the forecasts. Actionable implications are clear and conditional, with a specific Fair-Value Estimate of $125.00 and a Price/FVE ratio of 0.87, suggesting the stock is undervalued. The inclusion of a terminal growth rate and WACC with explicit justifications further strengthens the valuation framework.",

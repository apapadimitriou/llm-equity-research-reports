{
    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to the presence of multiple internal numeric contradictions combined with a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis, triggering the most restrictive hard caps in the evaluation framework. While the report attempts to be explicit by providing an assumptions appendix, the data provided fails the consistency test. Specifically, the narrative forecasts a 125-basis-point margin expansion in the first year post-integration, yet the financial snapshot table shows a 150-basis-point increase (21.3% to 22.8%). Additionally, the Appendix cites a 10.5% revenue CAGR for the FY25\u201329 period, but the figures in the financial table (growing from $6.1B to $9.8B) result in a calculated CAGR of only 9.95%.\n\nJustification for key inputs is weak; the 9.5% WACC and 3.0% terminal growth rate are presented as 'black-box' figures without supporting components like the risk-free rate, beta, or peer benchmarks. Specificity is undermined by the omission of critical drivers such as the effective tax rate, capital expenditures, and share count, which are necessary to bridge the gap between the narrative and the free cash flow estimates provided in the table. Finally, the report offers no quantified sensitivity tables or scenario-based valuations, leaving the fair value estimate of $580 completely unstressed against volatility in its primary drivers. Per the decision rules, the combination of unresolved contradictions and absent sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' rating.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are explicitly stated and specific, particularly regarding the multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise decline (5\u20137% CAGR) and Leqembi peak sales ($2.5B). However, the quality is severely undermined by a significant internal contradiction: the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) of $198.86 is stated to imply a 15x multiple of 2026 estimated earnings, yet the provided financial table lists 2026 EPS as $18.45. A 15x multiple on that figure would result in a valuation of $276.75, representing a ~39% discrepancy that remains unresolved in the text. Justification is only partial; while peer multiples for Regeneron and Vertex are cited, the WACC of 8.5% and terminal growth of 2.5% are provided as point values without a risk-free rate or equity risk premium build-up. Sensitivity analysis is present but insufficient for a 'Good' grade, as it is limited to a single driver (Leqembi adoption scenarios) and fails to quantify the impact of other material levers such as WACC or the rate of MS erosion. Furthermore, key model inputs like the effective tax rate and capital expenditure (capex) are entirely opaque. Per the decision rules, the presence of a major numeric contradiction and the lack of multi-driver quantified sensitivities cap the grade at 'Fair'.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple unresolved internal contradictions and the complete absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. First, the report exhibits a clear numeric conflict regarding 2025 revenue growth: the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section cites management guidance of 3-4%, while the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section models 'approximately $83 billion, representing 2-3% growth.' Second, there is a significant disconnect between the narrative and the model regarding credit risk; the text warns of credit card loss rates reaching 4-5%, yet the valuation appendix utilizes a 'Normalized' credit loss rate of 1.8% without explaining the transition or providing a bridge for the current valuation impact. Furthermore, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers such as interest rate shifts (NIM impact) or varying credit loss environments, relying instead on qualitative risk descriptions. This violates the hard cap requirement for a 'Fair' or better grade. Justification for key inputs like the 10.5% WACC is non-existent, and the tax rate is omitted entirely. While the report is specific in its units and time horizons, the lack of internal coherence and the 'black-box' nature of the valuation\u2014where narrative risks do not reconcile with the terminal assumptions\u2014render the quality of assumptions poor.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is a high-quality summary of public information but fails the criteria for originality. It relies almost exclusively on restating the Q1 2025 earnings release and management's own guidance. The central thesis\u2014that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are offsetting the Humira patent cliff\u2014is the consensus narrative and lacks a unique or non-obvious angle. There is no evidence of synthesis; for example, the report mentions the aesthetics decline but does not link it to specific consumer spending data or macro drivers beyond 'headwinds.' The valuation section is boilerplate, utilizing standard DCF mechanics (WACC, terminal growth) without introducing a novel driver or company-specific mechanism. Because the report contains zero original theses or syntheses and relies on generic sector insights (e.g., 'scale economies,' 'patent thickets'), it meets the hard cap for a 'Poor' grade.",

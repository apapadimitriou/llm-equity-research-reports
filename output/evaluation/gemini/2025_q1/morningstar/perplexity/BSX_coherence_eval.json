    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a high degree of structural coherence and narrative flow. It successfully connects the 'category leadership strategy' mentioned in the Business Strategy section to the specific product successes (FARAPULSE) and financial outcomes detailed in the Analyst Note and Financials Snapshot. Transitions between sections are smooth, particularly the way the Fair Value section explicitly reconciles the Bull/Bear arguments by quantifying the impact of pulsed field ablation (PFA) market share gains against the $200 million tariff headwind. The terminology is used consistently, with clear distinctions between organic and operational growth. However, the report suffers from a significant temporal inaccuracy that triggers a mandatory downgrade. While the report is dated April 24, 2025, it cites a source [6] for the current stock price that is dated September 9, 2025. This creates a logical impossibility where the 'Last Close' price and current valuation metrics are derived from a future date relative to the report's publication. Additionally, while the narrative is strong, the Financials Snapshot table rounds the 2024 revenue to $16.7B, whereas the Business Description provides a more precise $16.747B; while minor, this lack of precision between the table and text is a slight friction point. Despite these strengths in connective tissue and strategic analysis, the temporal citation error necessitates a 'fair' grade under the provided guardrails.",
    "evidence": [
        "The Fair Value section explicitly reconciles the Bull/Bear cases by weighing the $8B FARAPULSE opportunity against the $200M tariff impact (Fair Value and Profit Drivers).",
        "A temporal contradiction exists: the report is dated April 24, 2025, but Source [6], used for the 'Last Close' price, is dated September 9, 2025 (Cover Block/Sources).",
        "The Financials Snapshot table aligns with the narrative's margin expansion claims, showing a 60-70 bps annual increase that matches the '50-75 basis points' target (Financials Snapshot/Fair Value)."

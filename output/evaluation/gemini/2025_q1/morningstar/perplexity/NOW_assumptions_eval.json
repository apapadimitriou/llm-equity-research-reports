    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions for revenue growth (18-20% CAGR), operating margins (30-32%), and WACC (8.5-9.0%), primarily located in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix. While these inputs are specific in terms of magnitudes and time horizons, the report fails significantly on internal consistency and stress-testing. A major numeric contradiction exists between the narrative and the financial snapshot: the text projects an EPS CAGR of 20-25% through 2029, yet the provided table shows EPS nearly doubling from $7.93 in 2024 to $15.2 in 2025 (a 91.7% increase), which is mathematically irreconcilable with the stated growth rate. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. Although it qualitatively mentions 'Upside' and 'Downside' scenarios (e.g., faster AI adoption or recession impacts), it provides no numerical ranges or calculated impacts on the fair value estimate ($1,085.71). Per the grading rubric, the combination of a material internal contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities triggers a 'Poor' rating. The justification for drivers like WACC is present (citing Moody\u2019s), but the lack of an auditable trail between the narrative's growth claims and the table's projected outputs renders the model a 'black box.'",

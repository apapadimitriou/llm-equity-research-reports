    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a professional structure but is heavily reliant on restating data points from the provided sources, triggering the 'Fair' grade cap. Specifically, it repeats the $125 million AI ARR figure, the 42% market share statistic, and the ethical training narrative of Firefly directly from the source text. While the report attempts synthesis by interpreting management's focus on engagement as 'strategic patience' and extrapolating AI revenue to $500\u2013750 million by FY2026, these insights are relatively thin. The valuation section provides a specific price target ($420) and a quantified AI driver, but the broader 'Economic Moat' and 'Bulls/Bears' sections rely on boilerplate industry tropes regarding 'switching costs' and 'brand strength' that are not uniquely derived. Because more than three key insights are paraphrased from the provided search results and the valuation mechanism is a standard DCF extrapolation of public guidance, the report cannot exceed a 'Fair' rating.",

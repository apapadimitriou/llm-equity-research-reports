    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning instead as a summary of publicly available earnings releases and corporate announcements. Every 'insight' identified is either a restatement of Q1 2025 financial results (ADV, revenue, EPS), a recap of management changes (Terry Duffy\u2019s extension), or a repetition of well-known corporate partnerships (Google Cloud). The analysis of the company's 'Economic Moat' relies entirely on boilerplate industry terminology such as 'network effects' and 'regulatory barriers' without offering a company-specific angle or quantified competitive advantage beyond what is found in standard investor relations materials. Furthermore, the valuation section is generic, utilizing standard DCF assumptions (WACC, terminal growth) and P/E multiples without identifying a novel driver or mechanism that would differentiate this analysis from a basic financial aggregator. There is zero decision relevance as the report offers no testable catalysts or non-obvious conclusions, triggering the hard cap for reports with no synthesis or original thesis.",

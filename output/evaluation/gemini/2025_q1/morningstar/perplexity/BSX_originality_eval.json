    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a high-quality summary of public information and management guidance rather than an original piece of equity research. It fails to provide any unique synthesis or original theses, relying instead on restating figures and narratives directly from the provided source materials. For example, the projections for FARAPULSE market share, the 60\u201380% PFA adoption rate, and the 50\u201375 basis point margin expansion are all direct restatements of management's own Investor Day targets and guidance. The valuation section lacks any novel drivers, utilizing standard DCF mechanics and repeating the company's provided growth rates as inputs. While the report is well-structured and specific regarding units and catalysts (e.g., the $200M tariff impact), these are all publicly available data points from recent earnings calls and news releases. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to reach a non-obvious conclusion. Per the decision rules, the absence of any clear synthesis or original thesis necessitates a grade of 'Poor'.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a high-quality summary of public information rather than an original piece of equity research. Every primary 'insight' identified is a direct restatement of data points found in the cited sources, such as the $13 billion AI run rate, the 33% Azure growth rate, and the $80 billion capital expenditure figure. The analysis of the 'Economic Moat' relies on boilerplate terminology (switching costs, network effects) that is standard for the sector and lacks company-specific nuance beyond what is available in Morningstar-style filings. Crucially, the report fails to provide a synthesis of disparate data points; for example, while it mentions the conflict between AI expansion and carbon-negative goals, this is a direct recap of cited source [27] rather than an original interpretive conclusion. The valuation section is generic, utilizing a standard DCF with linear margin expansion (45% to 46%) and a consensus 13% CAGR without identifying a novel driver or catalyst. Because the report lacks a unique, testable thesis and relies entirely on paraphrasing public headlines and earnings releases, it does not meet the criteria for a 'Fair' grade.",

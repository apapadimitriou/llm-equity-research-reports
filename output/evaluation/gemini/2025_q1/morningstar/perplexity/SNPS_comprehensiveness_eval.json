    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report follows the required structural framework, covering all essential sections from the Analyst Note to ESG Risk. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant gaps in sector-specific depth and high redundancy. Most notably, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits critical software/EDA sector KPIs such as Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Net Retention Rate (NRR), and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO/Backlog). Per the grading instructions, the omission of \u22652 core sector KPIs triggers a hard cap at 'Fair'. Additionally, the report exhibits substantial redundancy; the $35 billion Ansys acquisition and the 50% TAM expansion figure are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, Bulls Say, and Capital Allocation sections with almost no incremental detail or new depth in each instance. While the valuation section provides a basic link between operating drivers (10-12% CAGR, 125 bps margin expansion) and the fair value outcome, the absence of a quantitative peer benchmarking table and a formal sensitivity/scenario analysis further limits the comprehensiveness of the analysis.",

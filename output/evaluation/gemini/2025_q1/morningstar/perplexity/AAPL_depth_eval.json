    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to establish clear causal links between segment performance and valuation. It explains the \"Services revenue mix shift\" as the primary driver for \"operating margin expansion,\" rather than simply stating margins will rise. The inference quality is strong, tying the \"Apple Intelligence\" rollout to a specific \"AI-related revenue\" forecast of $14 billion by 2025. Data usage is robust, with explicit, quantified assumptions for WACC (9.5%) and terminal growth (3.0%). Most importantly, the report provides a comprehensive treatment of uncertainty through a quantified scenario analysis in the appendix, offering specific Fair Value targets for \"Base Case ($245),\" \"Bull Case ($285),\" and \"Bear Case ($205)\" based on varying CAGRs and discount rates. It also quantifies regulatory risks, noting that non-compliance could cost \"up to 5% of daily global revenue.\" Actionable implications are clear, with a \"Price/FVE: 0.97\" indicating the stock is near fair value. While the terminal growth rate lacks a specific external benchmark, the internal consistency and sensitivity ranges elevate the analysis. Excerpts: \"Services now accounting for 28%... highlighting Apple's successful transition\"; \"Operating margin expansion... reflects Services revenue mix shift\"; \"AI-related revenue could reach $14 billion by 2025\"; \"WACC assumption of 9.5% reflects Apple's strong balance sheet\"; \"Fair value ranges from $225-265 per share depending on discount rate\"; \"Bear Case... Fair Value per Share $205\".",

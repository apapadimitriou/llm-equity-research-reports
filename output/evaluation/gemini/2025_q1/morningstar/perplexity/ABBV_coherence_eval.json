    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high level of structural organization and professional tone, with clear transitions between the strategic outlook and the valuation model. The narrative successfully connects the success of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to the mitigation of the Humira patent cliff. However, the document suffers from critical internal logic failures that trigger mandatory downgrades. Specifically, there is a severe temporal contradiction: the report is dated April 26, 2025, but the bibliography includes sources from September 2025 (Sources 3 and 18). This anachronism undermines the credibility of the data. Additionally, the 'Financials Snapshot' table presents a massive, unexplained leap in profitability, showing EPS rising from $2.39 in 2024 to $12.20 in 2025. While the Analyst Note mentions raised guidance, it does not address the fact that the 2024 figure represents GAAP earnings (depressed by acquisition costs) while the 2025 figure is an adjusted estimate. Mixing these metrics in a single time-series table without footnotes creates a misleading representation of growth. While the Bulls/Bears sections are well-reconciled with the base-case valuation, these data integrity issues and temporal inaccuracies cap the grade at 'fair' per the grading instructions.",

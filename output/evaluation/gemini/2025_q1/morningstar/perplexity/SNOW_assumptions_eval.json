    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is assigned a grade of 'Poor' due to a material internal contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis, violating multiple 'Hard Cap' evaluation rules. The narrative explicitly defines a 'revenue compound annual growth rate of 23% through fiscal 2029' as a key profit driver; however, the 'Financials Snapshot' table models a consistent 25.0% year-over-year growth rate from FY2025E ($3,654M) to FY2029E ($8,922M), resulting in a 4-year CAGR of 25% (or a 5-year CAGR of 26% from the FY2024A base). This 200-300 basis point discrepancy between the text and the model is an unresolved numeric contradiction. Furthermore, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis (e.g., bull/bear cases or valuation sensitivity to WACC/growth) for a high-growth technology company where the fair value estimate is highly sensitive to small input changes. While the report lists several key assumptions like WACC (10.5%) and terminal growth (3%), these are presented as point estimates without justification, build-up, or peer benchmarking. The justification for the operating margin expansion\u2014climbing from a -18.9% GAAP loss in FY2024 to a 15.2% profit in FY2029\u2014is purely qualitative and lacks a specific bridge to support such a rapid turnaround. These failures in consistency and stress-testing render the underlying model non-auditable.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all mandatory structural sections and provides a coherent narrative regarding Citigroup's organizational transformation and regulatory environment. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in sector-specific quantitative data and comparative analysis. Most critically, the Financials Snapshot is generic, utilizing standard corporate metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF, ROIC) while omitting essential banking-sector KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), Efficiency Ratio, and Loan Loss Provisions within the data table. While some metrics like CET1 and ROTE are mentioned in the text, their absence from the structured financial summary triggers the hard cap for comprehensiveness. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section and scenario/sensitivity analysis, which are required for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. The valuation section identifies drivers but lacks a granular bridge or sensitivity table to demonstrate how changes in interest rates or credit costs would impact the fair value estimate.",

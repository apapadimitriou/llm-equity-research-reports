    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, functioning instead as a high-quality compilation of the provided search results. Every major 'insight' is a direct restatement or paraphrase of the provided source material. For instance, the central 'Value Play' thesis is taken verbatim from the title of Source [12], the $800 million cost-savings figure is a restatement of Source [2], and the Leqembi growth analysis is a summary of Source [8]. Even the Fair Value Estimate of $198.86 is not an original calculation but is explicitly cited as the 'average analyst upside target' from Source [16]. The valuation section utilizes boilerplate DCF assumptions (8.5% WACC, 2.5% terminal growth) without introducing any novel company-specific drivers or mechanisms. Because the report does not combine data points to reach new, non-obvious conclusions and relies entirely on public headlines and consensus figures, it meets the hard cap for a 'Poor' grade due to a total lack of original synthesis or thesis.",

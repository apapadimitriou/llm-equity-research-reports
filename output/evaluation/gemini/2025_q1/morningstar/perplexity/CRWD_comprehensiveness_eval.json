    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. However, it fails to reach a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to significant omissions in sector-specific depth. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot table is generic, omitting critical SaaS KPIs such as Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Net Retention Rate (NRR) in the tabular data. While ARR is mentioned qualitatively in the text, its absence from the multi-year forecast table triggers a hard cap for comprehensiveness. Additionally, the report lacks quantitative peer benchmarking\u2014failing to provide a comparative table against rivals like Palo Alto Networks or Zscaler\u2014and does not include a sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation (Bull/Bear cases). The valuation linkage is present but basic, relying on a single-point P/E multiple without exploring variable outcomes. These gaps result in a report that provides a solid overview but lacks the analytical rigor and sector-specific granularity expected in professional equity research.",

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a professional structure with clear language and logical transitions between the strategic analysis and the financial outlook. The narrative effectively integrates the impact of the GIP and HPS acquisitions across multiple sections, including Strategy, Risk, and Capital Allocation. However, the report contains a significant internal contradiction and a temporal inaccuracy that necessitate a grade of fair. Specifically, the 'Analyst Note' cites a 14% revenue increase for 2024 (consistent with Source [1]), yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table shows revenue growing from $17.9 billion in 2023 to $19.8 billion in 2024, which is only a 10.6% increase. This discrepancy between the narrative and the data table remains unresolved. Furthermore, a critical temporal error occurs in the 'Sources' section, where Source [4] is dated September 2025\u2014five months after the report's stated date of April 12, 2025. This future-dated citation for a 'current' ROE metric violates the requirement for temporal accuracy. While the report's flow is otherwise 'good' and the 'Bulls/Bears' are partially reconciled through the margin expansion narrative, these technical failures regarding data consistency and temporal alignment trigger mandatory hard caps under the grading rubric. The reader is left with conflicting data points regarding the firm's top-line growth performance.",

        "Narrative claims '14% revenue increase' (Analyst Note) while the Financials Snapshot table shows 10.6% growth ($17.9B to $19.8B).",
        "Source [4] is dated 'September 2025' (Sources), which is five months after the '2025-04-12' report date.",
        "Operating margin expansion from 45.5% to 49.5% is consistently applied in both the Appendix and the Financials Snapshot."

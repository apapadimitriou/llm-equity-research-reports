    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers all required sections, but it is constrained by several technical omissions that trigger 'Fair' hard caps. The 'Financials Snapshot' table is generic, providing only high-level corporate metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting the core sector-specific KPIs essential for Amazon's sum-of-the-parts valuation, such as AWS segment revenue/margins and Advertising revenue. While these are mentioned in the text and Appendix assumptions, their absence from the multi-year financial history/forecast table limits the report's comprehensiveness. Furthermore, the valuation section identifies profit drivers but fails to provide an explicit quantitative link or bridge showing how specific operating improvements (e.g., a 100bps expansion in AWS margin) result in the $250 Fair Value Estimate. The report also lacks a quantitative peer benchmarking table and scenario/sensitivity analysis, which are requirements for higher grades. Finally, there is significant repetition of the '$100B CapEx' and 'once-in-a-lifetime AI opportunity' talking points across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Bulls sections without adding incremental depth in each instance.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are highly explicit and proximal to the forecasts, appearing clearly in both the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix. Specificity is a strength; the author provides precise magnitudes (22% revenue CAGR, 32% operating margin), clear time horizons (FY2029), and appropriate units. Internal consistency is excellent, with the narrative EPS bridge ($14.50) and revenue targets ($8.2B) reconciling perfectly with the 'Financials Snapshot' table and the 'Appendix' summary.\n\nHowever, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. Despite a dedicated 'Risk & Uncertainty' section, the analysis is purely qualitative. There are no quantified sensitivity tables or bull/bear scenarios showing how the $475 fair value estimate would fluctuate based on changes in the 11% WACC or the 22% revenue growth assumption. Justification is only partial; while the revenue and ARR targets are tied to management\u2019s public goals, the 11% WACC and 3% terminal growth rate are stated as 'black box' figures without supporting evidence from peer benchmarks or historical risk-free rate/beta components. Per the grading instructions, the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair,' regardless of the report's internal consistency and clarity.",

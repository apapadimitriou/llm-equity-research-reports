    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. It provides a clear valuation bridge, linking operating drivers (Services growth, iPhone cycles) to a specific fair value estimate, and includes a necessary scenario analysis in the appendix. However, the report is subject to a 'Fair' grade cap due to two primary failures. First, the 'Financials Snapshot' table is overly generic; while it includes standard financial metrics like Revenue and EPS, it omits core sector-specific KPIs such as Services Revenue forecasts, iPhone ASPs, or Segment Gross Margins, which are the primary drivers of the thesis. Second, the report exhibits significant redundancy, triggering a mandatory downgrade. Key talking points\u2014specifically the \u20ac500M EU fine and the 23% Services growth rate\u2014are repeated across four or more sections (Intro, Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, Risk, and Business Description) with almost identical phrasing and no additional depth. Furthermore, peer benchmarking is purely qualitative, lacking the comparative data tables expected in an 'Excellent' or 'Good' report.",

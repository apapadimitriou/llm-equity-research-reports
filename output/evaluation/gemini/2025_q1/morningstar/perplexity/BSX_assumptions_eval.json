    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a high degree of explicitness regarding its core valuation inputs, clearly stating assumptions for revenue growth (12-14% organic for 2025), margin expansion (50-75 bps annually), and capital expenditures (4-5% of revenue). These figures are proximal to the forecasts and are largely justified by citing management guidance and specific product catalysts like the FARAPULSE system. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to two primary deficiencies. First, it lacks quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers; while it mentions a Fair Value range ($115-$135), it does not provide the underlying data or a table showing how specific changes in growth or margins impact that valuation, rendering the sensitivity 'qualitative only.' Second, there is a significant internal numeric contradiction in the 'Financials Snapshot' table: it lists FY 2022A and FY 2023A revenue as identical ($14.2B), implying 0% growth. This directly contradicts the narrative's claim of 'sustained double-digit revenue growth' and conflicts with historical data where 2022 revenue was approximately $12.7B. These inconsistencies, combined with the lack of robust stress-testing on material levers, prevent the report from achieving a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",

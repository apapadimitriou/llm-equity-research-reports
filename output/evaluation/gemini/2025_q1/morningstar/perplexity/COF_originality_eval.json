    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions as a high-quality summary of public information but fails to provide any original insights or syntheses. It primarily restates data from the Q1 2025 earnings release (e.g., adjusted EPS of $4.06, marketing spend reduction) and the Discover acquisition announcement. The 'strategic' insights provided\u2014such as the benefits of vertical integration and the use of data-driven underwriting in subprime segments\u2014are boilerplate descriptions that have been associated with Capital One for years or are directly quoted from management's merger rationale. There is no evidence of the analyst combining disparate data points (e.g., macro trends, specific peer deposit betas, or regulatory shifts) to reach a non-obvious conclusion. The valuation section relies on standard P/E multiples and a generic 8-10% CAGR without identifying a novel driver or mechanism. Per the decision rules, the absence of any original thesis or synthesis necessitates a 'Poor' grade, as the content is entirely derivative of public filings and news headlines.",

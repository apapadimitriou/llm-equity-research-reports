    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on company press releases, news headlines (CNBC), and third-party summaries (Beanvest). Every 'insight' presented\u2014from the TAM expansion of the Ansys deal to the margin expansion targets and the impact of China export controls\u2014is a direct restatement of publicly available management guidance or recent news reports. The valuation section uses standard DCF mechanics with inputs (125 bp margin expansion, 15% growth target) taken directly from company presentations without independent adjustment or novel drivers. The report lacks any original interpretive commentary or non-obvious conclusions. Because it provides zero synthesis of data points into new conclusions and offers no company-specific angles not already available in public filings, it triggers the hard cap for a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is rated Poor due to multiple internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in listing its key drivers\u2014such as revenue growth, operating margins, WACC, and terminal growth\u2014it fails to provide any stress-testing or scenario analysis, which triggers a hard cap of 'Fair'. However, the grade is further downgraded to 'Poor' because of significant numeric and narrative inconsistencies between the text and the financial tables. Specifically, the text claims a 1\u20132% revenue CAGR for the 2025\u20132029 period, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table shows revenue declining from $60.0B in 2025 to $58.0B in 2029 (a negative CAGR). Furthermore, the narrative identifies 2025 as the 'peak' revenue year, while the table explicitly forecasts a peak in 2027 at $62.0B. Justification for valuation parameters is also weak; the WACC (8.0%), terminal growth (1.5%), and tax rate (13%) are presented as static figures without historical context, peer benchmarking, or derivation logic. These unresolved contradictions between the model's outputs and the analyst's narrative summary render the assumptions unreliable and the valuation 'black-box' in nature.",

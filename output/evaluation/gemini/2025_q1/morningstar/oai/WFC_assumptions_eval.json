    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to a critical internal contradiction combined with a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. The narrative explicitly forecasts growth in the bank's primary revenue streams for 2025, citing management guidance of 1\u20133% Net Interest Income (NII) growth and mid-single-digit fee income expansion. However, the 'Financials Snapshot' table contradicts this by modeling a year-over-year revenue decline from $125.4 billion in 2024 to $124.0 billion in 2025. This fundamental disconnect between the strategic outlook and the numerical model suggests a lack of internal coherence. Furthermore, while the report identifies significant material risks\u2014including regulatory asset-cap delays, litigation regarding Zelle fraud, and macroeconomic sensitivity\u2014it fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling to show how these variables impact the $75.0 fair value estimate. Key bank-specific drivers, most notably the provision for credit losses (credit cost), are entirely omitted from the explicit assumptions despite being listed as a primary risk factor. While the report provides specific figures for WACC, terminal growth, and tax rates, the failure to reconcile the revenue model with the narrative and the 'black-box' nature of the valuation's response to risk factors necessitate a Poor rating under the prescribed hard caps.",

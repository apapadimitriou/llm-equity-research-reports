    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report exhibits a \"Good\" level of analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide clear causal mechanisms and explicit valuation assumptions. The analyst identifies \"network effects\" and \"resilient consumer and travel spending\" as the primary drivers of revenue, and explicitly links EPS growth to \"buybacks and modest margin expansion.\" Valuation is transparent, utilizing a \"7.0% WACC\" and \"3.5% terminal growth,\" with revenue forecasts \"anchored by historical trends\" and benchmarked \"above underlying nominal GDP.\" The inclusion of a \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section provides necessary counterpoints, such as \"regulatory headwinds\" and \"interchange fees\" scrutiny. However, the report falls short of \"Excellent\" because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-scenario modeling. While it mentions \"modest downside if growth softens,\" it does not provide a specific range of outcomes or a sensitivity table for its WACC or terminal growth assumptions. The implications are \"cautiously constructive,\" but the lack of stress-testing against specific regulatory or macro shocks limits the decision-relevance for risk-averse investors. Verbatim excerpts: \"driven by resilient consumer and travel spending,\" \"network effects: each additional issuer or merchant adds value,\" \"WACC is assumed 7.0%,\" \"terminal growth is set at 3.5%,\" \"implying modest downside if growth softens,\" and \"revenue expanding... above underlying nominal GDP.\"",

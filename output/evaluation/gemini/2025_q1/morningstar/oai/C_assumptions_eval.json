    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, which violates the established hard caps. Specifically, the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section assumes a revenue CAGR of 5\u20137% for 2025\u20132027, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table reflects a much lower CAGR of approximately 3.9% for that period, with growth slowing to 2.2% by 2028. Furthermore, the 'Appendix' states a starting share count of 2.10 billion, which contradicts the implied share count of 1.87 billion derived from the report's own cover block data (Market Cap of $116.6B divided by a price of $62.1). There is also a minor inconsistency regarding operating margins, which the text claims will 'hold near 46%' while the table forecasts a steady expansion to 47%. While the report is explicit in stating its WACC (9%), terminal growth (3%), and tax rate (25%), and provides a basic quantified sensitivity analysis for WACC and revenue, these strengths are negated by the lack of internal coherence. Justifications for these drivers are often 'hand-wavy,' citing 'modest' growth without reconciling these figures against the bank's historical volatility or the specific quantitative impacts of the ongoing restructuring and divestitures mentioned in the strategy section.",

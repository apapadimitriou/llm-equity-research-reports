    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all mandatory sections and maintains consistent in-text citations with high-quality sourcing. However, it is strictly capped at 'Fair' due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs within the Financials Snapshot table. While Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Gross Retention are mentioned in the Analyst Note and Bulls/Bears sections, they are absent from the multi-year history and forecast table, which only provides generic financial metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF). This violates the requirement for sector-appropriate KPIs in the financials block. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking table and scenario/sensitivity analysis, which are necessary for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. Redundancy is also a factor; the report repeats specific data points regarding the 97% retention rate and $4.24B ARR across the Analyst Note and Bulls/Bears sections without adding new depth or context in the subsequent mentions. While the valuation section successfully links operating drivers (revenue deceleration and margin expansion) to the fair value outcome, the overall depth is limited by the lack of quantitative peer comparisons and sensitivity modeling.",

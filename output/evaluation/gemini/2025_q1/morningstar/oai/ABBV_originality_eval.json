    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on paraphrasing public news headlines and management guidance. Every major 'insight' presented\u2014including the Q1 2025 earnings beat, the raised EPS guidance, the $31B revenue target for Skyrizi/Rinvoq, and the $3.5B Cerevel write-down\u2014is a direct restatement of information from the cited Reuters articles. There is no evidence of independent analysis or the linking of disparate data points to form a new conclusion. The valuation section is entirely generic, utilizing a standard DCF model with boilerplate inputs (8% WACC, 1.5% terminal growth) and a peer-average P/E multiple without justifying these through any company-specific mechanism or novel driver. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections use standard industry phrasing ('scale & expertise,' 'patent thickets') that adds no interpretive value beyond what is available in public filings. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or testable theses and relies on \u22653 paraphrased insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions test due to a fundamental internal contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers such as revenue CAGR (25%), terminal growth (2%), and FY2026 revenue ($4.28B) are explicitly stated and aligned with management guidance, the valuation logic is internally inconsistent. The report cites a target P/E of 25x and a current trading multiple of 20x based on FY2026 EPS, yet the financial table forecasts a net loss of $2.00 per share for that same year. A positive price-to-earnings multiple cannot be applied to negative earnings without reconciliation, rendering the valuation opaque. Furthermore, the report provides only qualitative statements regarding sensitivity (e.g., 'shifts Snowflake\u2019s DCF value by several percent') rather than the required quantified ranges or scenarios for material drivers. Under the rubric's hard caps, the combination of a major numeric contradiction between the narrative and the tables, alongside the lack of quantified stress-testing, mandates a 'Poor' grade. Additionally, the 9% WACC is stated without any justification or component breakdown (risk-free rate, beta, etc.), and the transition from positive operating margins to negative EPS is left unexplained.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor primarily due to a significant internal contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in stating its key model inputs\u2014including a 10\u201312% revenue CAGR, an 8% WACC, and a 2\u20133% terminal growth rate\u2014it fails the consistency and stress-testing pillars. The most glaring issue is a numeric contradiction regarding profitability: the narrative in the 'Business Strategy' and 'Fair Value' sections forecasts non-GAAP operating margins expanding to the 'high 30s' or '~40%' by 2029, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table explicitly lists the 2029 operating margin at 24.0%. This 1,600-basis-point discrepancy between the text and the model table is unresolved and undermines the report's credibility. Furthermore, despite identifying material risks such as a 10% revenue exposure to China and geopolitical export controls that led to a guidance withdrawal, the report offers no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. There are no ranges provided for how changes in revenue growth, margin realization, or discount rates would impact the $400 fair value estimate. Per the instruction's hard caps, the combination of a major numeric contradiction and the lack of quantified sensitivities for material drivers necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely derivative, functioning as a summary of public news and financial filings rather than an original analysis. It identifies no unique catalysts or non-obvious theses. The 'Analyst Note' recaps Q4 results and management guidance without adding interpretive value. The valuation section follows a standard DCF template using consensus-aligned growth rates and generic margin assumptions. There is no evidence of synthesis (e.g., linking specific R&D milestones to quantified market share shifts) or original thesis development. All insights are classified as 'Restated' or 'Generic,' as they mirror the provided sources (Fierce Biotech, BioSpace, and SEC filings) often through light paraphrasing. The report fails to provide a company-specific angle that isn't already available in the cited press releases. For instance, the discussion on R&D strategy is a direct summary of a Fierce Biotech article, and the 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section merely lists well-known market sentiments. Because the report lacks any original thesis or synthesis of data points into new conclusions, and relies on boilerplate phrasing regarding 'scale and diversification' for its moat analysis, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the established rubric.",

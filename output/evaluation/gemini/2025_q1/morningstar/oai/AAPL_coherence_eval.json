    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a clear structure and professional tone, but it is held to a 'fair' grade due to internal mathematical contradictions and significant temporal inaccuracies that violate the grading guardrails. Specifically, the Fair Value section states that the $200 fair-value estimate implies a 2025 P/E of approximately 27x. However, the Financials Snapshot table provides a 2025E EPS of $6.80. Mathematically, $200 divided by $6.80 results in a 29.4x multiple, not 27x. The 27x multiple actually aligns with the 2026E EPS of $7.40, suggesting a mismatch between the narrative and the data table. Additionally, the report repeatedly describes a 'recent' moat upgrade by Morningstar in the Economic Moat section, yet the corresponding citations (Sources 8 and 9) are dated January 2023. In a report dated May 2025, characterizing a two-year-old event as 'recent' is misleading. While the narrative flow is generally good and the Analyst Note successfully integrates the Q1 and Q2 2025 results, these inconsistencies between the text, the tables, and the cited dates require the reader to reconcile the argument themselves. The Bulls/Bears section is adequately reconciled with the valuation narrative, noting the stock's premium pricing, but the data-integrity issues trigger the mandatory 'fair' cap.",

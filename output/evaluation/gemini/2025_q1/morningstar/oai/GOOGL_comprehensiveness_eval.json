    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is well-structured and covers all required qualitative sections, including a clear business description, strategy outlook, and a balanced Bulls/Bears analysis. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and the lack of comparative analysis. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot table is generic, providing only consolidated metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting core sector-specific KPIs such as Google Cloud Revenue, Search/YouTube Revenue breakdowns, and Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC). Per the grading instructions, the absence of at least two core sector KPIs in the Financials Snapshot triggers a hard cap at 'Fair'. Furthermore, the report lacks a dedicated Peer Benchmarking section and a Scenario/Sensitivity Analysis table, both of which are required for higher grades. While the valuation section qualitatively links drivers like Cloud acceleration to the DCF outcome, the lack of granular segment forecasting prevents a truly comprehensive quantitative bridge. Sourcing is consistent and the economic moat analysis is robust, but these strengths cannot override the hard caps regarding KPI disclosure and missing benchmarking.",

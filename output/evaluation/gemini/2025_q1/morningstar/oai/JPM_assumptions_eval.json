    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions test primarily due to significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers like revenue growth (5% CAGR), operating margins (44%), and WACC (8.5%) are explicitly stated and proximal to the valuation narrative, they are undermined by mathematical incoherence. Specifically, the report claims a current P/E of 14x and a forward P/E of 17x, yet the provided price ($233.93) and EPS forecasts ($19.8 and $21.0) result in actual multiples of 11.8x and 11.1x, respectively. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the 2025e EPS cited in the text ($21.4) and the financials table ($21.0). Justification is only partial, relying on historical ROTCE for WACC but providing no peer benchmarking for the 3.2% NIM or 2% terminal growth. Most critically, the report offers only qualitative risk descriptions (e.g., 'rate risks are two-sided') without any quantified stress-testing or scenario analysis for material levers like interest rates or credit provisions. Per the grading rubric, the combination of multiple numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking financial forecasts to specific business drivers, such as the margin-accretive shift toward AWS and advertising. It provides explicit, quantified valuation assumptions, including an 8.5% WACC, 3% terminal growth, and capex maintained at 12\u201313% of sales. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of how logistics automation and AI routing bolster margins, and how 'subdued demand forced customers to seek lower-priced goods.' The report benchmarks revenue growth against historical performance (11.9% in 2023) and provides a clear competitive context for AWS market share (30% vs. Azure's 20%). While the report identifies significant risks\u2014including 25% tariffs on Chinese imports and labor disruptions\u2014it fails to quantify the impact of these variables through sensitivity analysis or distinct bull/bear scenarios. The implications are actionable, providing a clear fair-value estimate of $230 and a conditional 'Neutral' stance based on the need for growth acceleration. However, the lack of a quantified sensitivity table or stress-tested scenarios prevents an 'Excellent' grade.",

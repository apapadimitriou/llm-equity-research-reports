    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is Poor due to multiple unresolved internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in stating its key drivers\u2014such as NII growth, revenue CAGR, and operating margins\u2014these figures frequently conflict between the narrative sections and the 'Financials Snapshot' table. Specifically, the narrative projects a 2029 EPS of $4.50 and steady 22% margins, while the table forecasts $4.70 and margins rising to 23%. Similarly, revenue CAGR is inconsistently cited as 2-4% and 3-5% in different sections. Justification is partial; while management guidance is cited for near-term NII, long-term drivers like the 8.5% WACC and 2% terminal growth rate are presented as 'black-box' inputs without supporting build-ups or peer benchmarking. Most critically, the report fails the hard cap for sensitivity analysis. Despite identifying significant macro and interest rate risks, it offers no quantified scenarios or ranges (e.g., the impact of a 100bps rate shift on NII or valuation). This lack of stress-testing, combined with at least three distinct numeric discrepancies between text and tables, necessitates a 'Poor' grade under the evaluation framework. The assumptions are traceable but lack the internal coherence and robust testing required for a higher rating.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a structured overview of CVS Health, covering all required sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. It successfully integrates evidence from recent earnings calls and SEC filings, providing a clear narrative on the company's vertical integration strategy and current turnaround efforts. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot table is generic and omits core sector-specific KPIs such as Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), Medical Membership counts, and Prescription Volumes, which are essential for a healthcare/insurance entity. While these metrics are mentioned sporadically in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast table violates the requirement for sector-appropriate financial data. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or table, providing only passing mentions of competitors. There is also notable redundancy, with the store closure initiative and CEO transition repeated across multiple sections without adding incremental depth. Finally, the valuation section lacks a formal scenario analysis or sensitivity table, offering only a brief mention of WACC sensitivity.",

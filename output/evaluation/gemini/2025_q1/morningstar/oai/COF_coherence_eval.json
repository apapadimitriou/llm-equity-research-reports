    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded Fair due to unresolved contradictions between the narrative evidence and the quantitative valuation model. Most notably, the report cites a Q1 2025 net charge-off rate of 3.45% in the Analyst Note and Bulls/Bears sections, yet the Fair Value section and Appendix base the $230 valuation on a significantly more optimistic 2.8\u20133.0% stabilization rate. There is no connective tissue explaining how the firm will achieve this improvement amidst the 'ongoing economic volatility' cited by management. Additionally, the Financials Snapshot table contains internal friction; it forecasts FY 2025 revenue at $40.0B, which represents only 3.9% growth over the FY 2024 figure of $38.5B, directly contradicting the '6\u20137% annual revenue growth' assumption explicitly stated in the Fair Value section. Temporally, the report uses deposit data from September 2024, which is nearly seven months old, despite the report being dated April 2025 and having access to Q1 2025 earnings results. While the narrative regarding the Discover merger is well-articulated and the structural flow between sections is logical, the failure to reconcile the Bear case's specific legal risks\u2014such as the $2B CFPB lawsuit\u2014with the base-case DCF, which simply assumes 'no major adverse ruling,' further undermines the coherence of the argument. These quantitative and logical gaps trigger the hard cap for unaddressed contradictions.",

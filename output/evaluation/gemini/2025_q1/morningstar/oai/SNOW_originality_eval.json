    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a news aggregator rather than an original research piece. It relies almost exclusively on external reporting from Reuters and company press releases to form its narrative. Every 'insight' presented\u2014from the impact of the new CEO and AI partnerships to the valuation comparison with MongoDB\u2014is a direct paraphrase or restatement of cited public sources. There is zero evidence of synthesis; the author does not link disparate data points (e.g., how specific AI infrastructure investments will mathematically impact the long-term margin trajectory beyond repeating management's guidance). The valuation section is entirely boilerplate, utilizing a standard DCF with generic growth and margin assumptions that lack any novel company-specific drivers or mechanisms. Because the report contains no original thesis and fails to provide interpretive commentary that goes beyond the source material, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the decision rules.",

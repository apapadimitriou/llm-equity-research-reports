    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "This report demonstrates a near-total reliance on external sources, specifically Reuters, Morningstar, and SEC filings, for both its data and its analytical framework. Every major 'insight' presented\u2014ranging from the growth of AWS and advertising to the impact of AI on cloud demand\u2014is a restatement of public headlines or consensus viewpoints. There is no evidence of original synthesis; the report merely links existing data points (e.g., higher AWS mix leads to higher margins) in a mechanical fashion that has been a staple of Amazon analysis for years. The valuation section is particularly boilerplate, utilizing a standard DCF model with generic WACC and growth assumptions that lack any company-specific or novel drivers. Furthermore, the 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections are largely paraphrased from Morningstar, offering no unique interpretive commentary. Because the report fails to provide a single original thesis or a non-obvious, decision-relevant conclusion, and because more than three of its primary insights are generic restatements or paraphrased from cited sources, it fails to meet the threshold for a 'Fair' grade. It functions as a summary of recent news rather than an original piece of equity research.",

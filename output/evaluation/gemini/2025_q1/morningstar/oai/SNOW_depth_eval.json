    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a structured financial forecast and identifies key causal drivers, such as AI integration driving momentum and scale leading to operating leverage. It explicitly states DCF assumptions, including a 9% WACC and 2% terminal growth. However, it fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges. While it mentions that changes in growth or margin shift the DCF value \u201cby several percent,\u201d this is a vague generalization rather than a rigorous stress test. Furthermore, while valuation multiples are benchmarked against peers like MongoDB, the internal operating assumptions (e.g., the 15% margin target) are not benchmarked against industry peers or historical SaaS trajectories. The \u201cBulls Say / Bears Say\u201d section identifies risks but does not explore their financial impact. Consequently, the report remains a single-point estimate without a robust treatment of uncertainty. Excerpts: \u201cmomentum reflects deepening AI integration\u201d (causal); \u201ccredits to clients... could weigh on operating profitability\u201d (causal); \u201charder to leave due to high switching costs\u201d (mechanism); \u201cWACC of ~9% and a modest long-term growth rate (2%)\u201d (assumption); \u201cshifts Snowflake\u2019s DCF value by several percent\u201d (unsupported generalization).",

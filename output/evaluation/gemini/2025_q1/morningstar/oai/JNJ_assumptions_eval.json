    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are explicit and specific regarding magnitudes and time horizons, but they fail significantly on consistency and sensitivity. There are two distinct numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables: the text assumes a 4.5% revenue CAGR through 2029, while the provided table figures ($88.82B to $104.98B) imply only a 3.4% CAGR. Similarly, the text models a 19% operating margin for 2029, whereas the financials table explicitly forecasts 20%. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like WACC or revenue growth, offering only qualitative statements about potential upside or downside. Per the grading rubric, the combination of multiple internal contradictions and the absence of quantified stress-testing necessitates a 'Poor' grade. While justifications are provided via management guidance and historical context, they are undermined by the lack of internal coherence across the document's data points. The WACC calculation is provided with specific components, which is a positive for explicitness, but the failure to reconcile the primary growth and margin drivers between the DCF narrative and the summary financials snapshot creates an audibility gap that prevents a higher rating.",

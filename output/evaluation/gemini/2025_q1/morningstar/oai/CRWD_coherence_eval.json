    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded fair due to internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables that remain unaddressed. Specifically, the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section states that revenue growth is expected to decelerate to approximately 15% by FY2029. However, the Financials Snapshot table shows growth dipping to 14.2% in FY2028 before accelerating to 15.6% in FY2029, contradicting the claimed downward trend. Furthermore, the Analyst Note highlights record profitability for FY2025, yet the table reveals that GAAP EPS actually turned negative (-$0.1) and ROIC fell from 4.0% to 1.0% in that same period. While the narrative specifies non-GAAP for its profitability claim, it fails to reconcile or explain the significant divergence from the GAAP losses shown in the data. Beyond these inconsistencies, the report is well-structured. It provides a clear logical flow from the business description to the valuation model. Transitions are generally smooth, and the Bulls Say / Bears Say section is effectively integrated into the broader risk and valuation argument. The use of recent to describe the July 2024 outage is appropriate for a March 2025 report. However, a minor terminology error in the Economic Moat section (solicitation-of-choice) further detracts from the precision required for a higher grade.",

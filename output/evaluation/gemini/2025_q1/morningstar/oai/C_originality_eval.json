    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on paraphrasing public news and SEC filings. Every major 'insight'\u2014from the Q1 2025 earnings surge in equities trading to the lowered 10\u201311% ROTCE target\u2014is a direct restatement of information available in Reuters articles or company press releases. There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points (e.g., specific deposit beta trajectories or quantified impacts of the Mexico divestiture) to form a new conclusion. The valuation section is particularly generic, utilizing standard DCF inputs (9% WACC, 3% terminal growth) without introducing any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections use boilerplate language applicable to any large diversified bank, such as 'customers are price-sensitive' and 'competition from JPMorgan.' Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis and relies on more than three paraphrased or generic insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the specified decision rules.",

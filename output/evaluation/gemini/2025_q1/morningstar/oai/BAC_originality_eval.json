    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely a compilation of public data points and management guidance, primarily sourced from Reuters and Bank of America's own investor relations filings. It fails to provide any original synthesis or a unique investment thesis. Every 'insight' presented is either a direct restatement of historical financial results (e.g., Q4 2024 earnings), a repetition of management's 2025 guidance (e.g., record NII), or a generic description of the banking sector (e.g., competition from fintech, scale as a moat). There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to form a new conclusion; for instance, the discussion on NII simply parrots management's forecast without independent verification or a unique angle on deposit betas or yield curve impacts. The valuation section is particularly weak, utilizing a standard DCF model with boilerplate assumptions (3-5% CAGR, 22% margin) that lack any company-specific novel drivers. Consequently, the report offers zero decision-relevance for an institutional investor looking for an edge beyond public headlines. Because there is no original synthesis or thesis, and more than three insights are restated or generic, the report meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's quality of assumptions is graded as Poor due to significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, which violates the consistency pillar. Specifically, the report explicitly states a 2025\u20132029 revenue CAGR of 10\u201312% in both the 'Fair Value' section and the 'Appendix,' yet the figures provided in the 'Financials Snapshot' (growing from $164.5B to $250.7B) result in a calculated CAGR of only 8.8%. Furthermore, the narrative and appendix project operating margins rising to 45% by 2029, while the financial table explicitly forecasts a flat 42% margin for the final three years of the period (2027\u20132029). These discrepancies suggest a lack of coordination between the qualitative forecast and the quantitative model. While the report is commendable for being explicit with its inputs\u2014providing specific magnitudes for WACC (8%), tax rates (18\u201320%), and terminal growth (2\u20133%)\u2014and includes quantified sensitivity analysis for WACC and revenue growth, the hard cap for multiple contradictions must be applied. The justifications provided are largely generic (e.g., 'long-term GDP plus inflation' for terminal growth), and the failure to reconcile the primary margin and revenue drivers across the document undermines the auditability and reliability of the fair value estimate.",

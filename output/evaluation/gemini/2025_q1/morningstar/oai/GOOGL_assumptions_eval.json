    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions criteria primarily due to significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While key drivers such as revenue growth (10\u201312% CAGR) and operating margins (mid-30%) are explicitly stated and proximal to the valuation narrative, they are undermined by glaring numeric inconsistencies. Specifically, the report cites a Q1 2025 capex of $17B (implying a $68B annual run rate) and a management target of $85B through 2025, yet the valuation model assumes a capex of only $30\u201335B per year. This 50%+ discrepancy in a material driver is never reconciled. Furthermore, the financial snapshot table forecasts Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $120B as early as 2025, whereas the narrative states this level will only be reached 'by the end of the decade.' These contradictions between the text, the tables, and the cited historical data violate the consistency pillar. Additionally, the report offers no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material levers like WACC, terminal growth, or ad-spend volatility, providing only qualitative mentions of risk. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

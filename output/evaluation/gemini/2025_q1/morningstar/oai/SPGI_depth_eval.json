    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking financial outcomes to specific strategic drivers, such as the \"portfolio simplification\" from the Mobility spin-off and the \"integration of recent acquisitions\" like Visible Alpha. It provides explicit, quantified valuation assumptions (WACC ~8%, terminal growth ~2%, and 5\u20136% revenue CAGR) and benchmarks these against management's guidance and historical valuation multiples. Causal reasoning is evident in the explanation of how operating leverage and subscription growth drive margins. While it identifies qualitative risks and counterpoints in the \"Bears Say\" and \"Risk & Uncertainty\" sections, it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based price targets (e.g., how a change in interest rates or debt issuance volumes would specifically impact the $400 fair value estimate). The implications are actionable, clearly identifying the current market price as \"demanding\" relative to the calculated fair value. Excerpts: \"portfolio simplification... expected to unlock strategic focus\"; \"WACC of ~8% and a 2% terminal growth rate\"; \"integration of recent acquisitions... boosts recurring analytics sales\"; \"current valuation as demanding\"; \"operating leverage... should support gradually rising EBITDA\".",

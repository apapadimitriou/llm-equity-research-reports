    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions test primarily due to multiple material internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in stating its key drivers (revenue, margins, WACC), it suffers from two distinct numeric conflicts. First, the 'Analyst Note' estimates the post-split share count at approximately 380 million, whereas the 'Fair Value' and 'Appendix' sections assume 700 million shares\u2014a nearly 85% discrepancy that invalidates the per-share valuation logic. Second, the narrative forecasts 'high-single-digit EPS growth,' yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table models EPS growing from $6.2 to $11.0 over four years, representing a ~15.4% CAGR, which is clearly double-digit growth. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like revenue growth or WACC, offering only qualitative risk descriptions. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities, triggers a mandatory 'Poor' grade. While the justification for revenue and margins is partially supported by management guidance and industry benchmarks, the lack of internal coherence and stress-testing makes the model's outputs feel like a black box.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report functions primarily as a news aggregator and a summary of third-party research, failing to provide any original synthesis or unique theses. Every major 'insight' is a direct restatement or paraphrase of cited news articles (AP News, Reuters) or existing analyst reports (Morningstar, Sustainalytics). For instance, the 'Economic Moat' section explicitly attributes its conclusions to Morningstar, and the 'ESG Risk' section relies entirely on Sustainalytics' industry comparisons. The valuation section utilizes a standard DCF model with generic growth and margin assumptions that lack any novel company-specific drivers or quantified mechanisms beyond basic fixed-cost leverage. There is no evidence of the analyst connecting disparate data points to form a new conclusion; instead, the report repeats public headlines regarding earnings beats, capex guidance, and regulatory trials. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or testable theses and relies heavily on boilerplate phrasing, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the specified hard caps.",

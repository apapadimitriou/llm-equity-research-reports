    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a 'Good' level of analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to explain the underlying drivers of Meta\u2019s financial performance. It provides clear causal mechanisms, such as how 'AI improves ad targeting' and 'novel ad formats on Reels' are expected to 'boost engagement' and revenue. The analyst explicitly links the massive $64\u201372 billion capex guidance to AI infrastructure, providing a logical bridge to future 'fixed-cost leverage' and margin expansion. Inference quality is supported by a detailed DCF model with explicit assumptions, including a 'WACC is estimated near 8%' and a '2025\u201329 revenue CAGR ~10\u201312%.' Crucially, the report includes quantified sensitivity analysis, noting that '100bp higher WACC... lower fair value by 5\u201310%.' This provides investors with a clear understanding of the valuation's fragility. However, the report falls short of 'Excellent' because it lacks multiple quantified scenarios (e.g., a specific Bear case for Reality Labs losses) and does not rigorously benchmark its growth assumptions against broader industry data or competitors. While it identifies risks like 'Chinese marketers Temu/Shein likely cutting budgets,' these are not quantified in terms of their specific impact on the 2025 revenue forecast. The implications are actionable, providing a clear 'Fair-Value Estimate USD 650.0' against the current price, but the treatment of uncertainty remains largely qualitative outside of the single sensitivity sentence.",

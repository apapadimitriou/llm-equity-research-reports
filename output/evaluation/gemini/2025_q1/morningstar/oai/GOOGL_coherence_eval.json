    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is assigned a \"fair\" grade, primarily due to multiple unresolved quantitative contradictions and a significant temporal error that triggers the rubric's mandatory hard caps. The most damaging inconsistency is found in the capital expenditure assumptions: the \"Business Strategy & Outlook\" section projects capex of ~$85 billion through 2025, while the \"Fair Value and Profit Drivers\" section bases its valuation on a much lower ~$30\u201335 billion annual spend. This 150% variance is never addressed, rendering the DCF model's reliability questionable. Additionally, the \"Financials Snapshot\" table forecasts a 2025 free cash flow of $120 billion, which is irreconcilable with the $19 billion Q1 figure reported in the Analyst Note without further explanation of such massive back-loading.\n\nThe report also fails the temporal accuracy check by citing a source (Source 7) dated August 11, 2025, despite the report itself being dated April 25, 2025. This inclusion of \"future\" data undermines the credibility of the research. Furthermore, the \"Bears Say\" section claims the valuation already reflects strong growth with \"limited margin for error,\" which directly contradicts the Analyst Note\u2019s assertion that the stock is undervalued at 0.7x its fair value. While the narrative transitions are smooth and the sections are structurally well-linked, these fundamental data conflicts force the reader to adjudicate between competing facts, necessitating a downgrade to \"fair.\"",

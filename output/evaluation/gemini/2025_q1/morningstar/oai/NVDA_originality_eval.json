    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is almost entirely a restatement of public news headlines and standard financial data from the provided sources (Reuters and AP News). It fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis. The analysis of Nvidia\u2019s 'Wide Moat' and 'CUDA ecosystem' is boilerplate and widely available in the public domain. The valuation section uses a standard DCF model with generic assumptions (9% WACC, 18-20x terminal multiple) and lacks any novel drivers or company-specific mechanisms beyond management's own guidance. There are no testable, non-obvious catalysts or interpretive commentaries that link data points into new conclusions. Because the report offers zero original synthesis and relies on generic sector-wide insights, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the specified decision rules.",

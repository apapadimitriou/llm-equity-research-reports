    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound, covering all mandatory sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. It provides a clear narrative regarding Amazon\u2019s transition toward higher-margin AWS and advertising revenue. However, the report is held to a 'Fair' grade due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot table is overly generic; while the text identifies AWS and Advertising as the primary valuation drivers, these core sector-specific KPIs are absent from the multi-year forecast table, which only provides consolidated metrics. This triggers a hard cap under the evaluation criteria requiring sector-specific KPIs in the financial summary.\n\nFurthermore, the report lacks a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis. While a fair value of $230 is derived, there is no quantitative demonstration of how this value fluctuates relative to changes in WACC or terminal growth rates. Redundancy is also present; the discussion of labor strikes and the company\u2019s scale-based moat is repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Risk sections without adding incremental depth. While the report successfully integrates citations and provides peer context (comparing AWS to Azure), the lack of granular segment forecasting in the financial table and the absence of sensitivity modeling prevent it from achieving a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating.",

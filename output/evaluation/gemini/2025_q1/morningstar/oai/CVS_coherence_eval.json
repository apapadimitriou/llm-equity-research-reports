    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report fails fundamentally on coherence due to severe temporal impossibilities and internal contradictions. The document is dated May 2, 2025, yet the Bulls Say, Bears Say, and Fair Value sections cite specific earnings results and Reuters articles from July 31, 2025. This logical impossibility suggests a failure in document assembly. Furthermore, the Financials Snapshot table explicitly states that 'actual 2024 results were not published by cut-off,' which directly contradicts the Analyst Note that provides specific Q4 2024 adjusted EPS figures ($1.19) and Q1 2025 results. There is also a significant lack of reconciliation regarding 2025 guidance; the Analyst Note and Financials table base their valuation on a $6.10 EPS midpoint, while the Bulls Say section introduces a higher $6.30\u20136.40 range from a future-dated source that is never integrated into the base-case narrative or the DCF model. These discrepancies create a report where the reader must decide which set of facts to believe, as the narrative, tables, and citations are in constant conflict. While the language itself is clear, the structural integrity is compromised by these unresolved tensions and the inaccurate 'recency' of data that post-dates the report's own publication date.",

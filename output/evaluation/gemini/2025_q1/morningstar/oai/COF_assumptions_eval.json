    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to significant internal numeric contradictions and unjustified departures from recent historical data. Most critically, there is a direct conflict between the narrative and the financial tables regarding revenue growth; the text explicitly assumes a 6\u20137% annual revenue growth, while the provided figures in the Financials Snapshot (FY24 $38.5B to FY29 $49.0B) result in a CAGR of only 4.9%. Furthermore, the model assumes credit charge-offs will 'stabilize' in the 2.8\u20133.0% range, which contradicts the report\u2019s own evidence that current Q1 2025 charge-offs are 3.45% and trending upward amidst 'ongoing economic volatility.' No justification is provided for this projected improvement in credit quality.\n\nThe justification for key valuation inputs is weak. The WACC is set at 8.0% despite a 6.0% risk-free rate, implying a negligible 2.0% risk premium. This is fundamentally inconsistent with the report\u2019s 'High Uncertainty' rating and 'High' ESG risk profile. While the report provides specific magnitudes and includes some quantified sensitivity analysis (e.g., the $5 impact of interest rate shifts on fair value), these are undermined by the lack of internal coherence. The failure to reconcile optimistic model inputs with deteriorating credit trends mentioned in the Analyst Note suggests a 'black-box' approach where the valuation model is disconnected from the qualitative risks described. Per the grading rubric, two or more distinct contradictions necessitate a Poor rating.",

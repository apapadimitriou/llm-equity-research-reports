    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' primarily due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, which violates the hard caps for internal consistency. First, the text explicitly forecasts a 'mid-5% revenue CAGR,' but the data provided in the Financials Snapshot (growing from $357.8B in 2023 to $430.0B in 2029) calculates to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3.1%. Second, the narrative projects operating margins recovering toward a '7-8%' range, yet the financial table explicitly caps the 2029 estimate at 6.5%. These discrepancies make the model's internal logic impossible to reconcile and audit.\n\nWhile the report is explicit in stating its key drivers\u2014such as the WACC (8-9%), terminal growth (2-3%), and the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) targets\u2014the justification is only partial, relying heavily on recent quarterly beats rather than long-term historical context or peer benchmarking. Specificity is generally good, with clear units and horizons provided for most inputs. However, the sensitivity analysis is insufficient; while it quantifies the impact of WACC changes (10 bps = 5% FV impact), it offers only qualitative commentary on other material risks like medical cost volatility and retail pressure. Per the decision rules, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions between the text and the tables necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by linking financial outcomes to specific operational and regulatory drivers. It provides clear causal explanations for the 2025 NII forecast, stating 'NII rising 1\u20133%... as deposit costs ease,' and attributes margin improvements to 'ongoing efficiency efforts.' Assumptions for the DCF valuation are explicitly stated, including 'WACC \u22488.5%, terminal growth 2%,' and the resulting valuation is benchmarked against historical averages and regional bank peers. The report identifies critical uncertainties, such as the timing of the asset-cap removal and the Zelle fraud litigation, noting that 'asset-cap removal... could accelerate growth.' However, the analysis fails to reach 'Excellent' because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based modeling. While it lists 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' points, it does not calculate how specific risks\u2014such as a delay in regulatory relief or a specific credit loss spike\u2014would numerically impact the fair value estimate or EPS. The implications are actionable but remain single-point estimates rather than a range of outcomes.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, including all required sections such as the Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and ESG Risk. It provides strong regulatory context regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s asset cap and consent orders, with consistent in-text citations. However, the report is strictly capped at 'Fair' due to the Financials Snapshot. For a banking sector report, the multi-year forecast table is generic and omits essential sector-specific KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), and Provisions for Credit Losses. While some of these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the formal financial snapshot violates the core requirements for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade. Additionally, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking table and scenario/sensitivity analysis. There is also significant redundancy, as the $1.95T asset cap and regulatory progress are repeated across five different sections with limited incremental depth in each mention.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is Poor due to multiple severe internal contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst explicitly states key drivers such as revenue growth, operating margins, and WACC, the narrative frequently conflicts with the provided data tables. Most notably, the report forecasts a '20% EPS CAGR through 2029 (to ~$33)' in the Fair Value section, yet the Financials Snapshot table explicitly lists 2029 EPS as $26.50, which represents only a ~13.8% CAGR from the 2024 base. Similarly, the Analyst Note projects revenue expanding in the 'mid-10%s,' but the model and table show 2025 growth at 12% followed by a steady deceleration to 6.3% by 2029.\n\nJustification is only partial; while the report cites historical 12% revenue growth to support near-term forecasts, it fails to provide a technical build-up for the 7.0% WACC or the 3.5% terminal growth rate. Specificity is present regarding units and time horizons, but the internal logic is flawed, evidenced by the nonsensical description of share count as 'flat share count declining at ~2% per year.' Finally, the report fails the mandatory requirement for stress-testing; although it identifies regulatory and macro risks qualitatively, it provides no quantified ranges or scenario-based impacts on the $478 fair value estimate. Per the grading rubric, the presence of two or more distinct numeric contradictions necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

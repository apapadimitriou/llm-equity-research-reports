    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or unique thesis, relying almost exclusively on restating data from CrowdStrike\u2019s FY2025 earnings press release and management guidance. Every key metric\u2014including the 29% revenue growth, the $4.24B ARR, and the 60% multi-module adoption rate\u2014is a direct excerpt from public filings. The valuation section is particularly weak, offering a standard DCF fair-value estimate of $180 based on generic deceleration assumptions without identifying any novel drivers or specific internal mechanisms (e.g., cohort-specific margin expansion or unit economic shifts) that would differentiate the analysis from consensus. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' and 'Risk' sections utilize boilerplate phrasing regarding competition and the 2024 sensor outage without adding interpretive commentary or new conclusions. Because the report lacks even a single weak synthesis and offers no company-specific angle not already available in the public domain, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade under the decision rules.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all the required structural sections, including a clear business description, moat analysis, and risk assessment. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and the lack of structured peer context. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot is generic and lacks at least two core semiconductor-specific KPIs: Gross Margin and R&D intensity. While Gross Margin is mentioned in the text, its absence from the multi-year forecast table is a major gap for a semiconductor firm. Additionally, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or table, providing only qualitative mentions of competitors like AMD and Intel without comparative metrics. There is also no scenario or sensitivity analysis to address the 'High' uncertainty rating. Furthermore, the report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating the 'China export ban' and '20% revenue' talking point across five different sections (Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, Bears Say, and Risk) without adding incremental depth, which triggers a one-level downgrade from a potential 'Good' rating.",

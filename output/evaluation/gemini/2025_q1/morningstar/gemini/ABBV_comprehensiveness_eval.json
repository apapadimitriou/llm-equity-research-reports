    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report on AbbVie Inc. provides a structured overview of the company's transition following the Humira patent cliff, including drug-specific revenue forecasts and a valuation model linked to these drivers. However, it fails to reach a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to several critical omissions and structural weaknesses. Most notably, the report completely lacks peer benchmarking; there is no comparison of AbbVie\u2019s market share, margins, or valuation against industry competitors like Pfizer or Merck. Additionally, while a DCF model is mentioned, the report omits a scenario or sensitivity analysis, which is essential for a 'High Uncertainty' biopharma rating. Significant redundancy is present, as the $3.5 billion emraclidine impairment is repeated across seven different sections (Analyst Note, Strategy, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Risk, Capital Allocation, and ESG) without providing incremental analytical depth. Furthermore, the Financials Snapshot is incomplete, marking ROIC as 'N/A' and omitting specific patent expiration dates for the growth portfolio (Skyrizi/Rinvoq). The absence of peer context and the high level of repetition, combined with missing sector-specific KPIs like market share and trial efficacy data, cap the grade at 'Fair'.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its valuation model, including a 22% five-year revenue CAGR, a 9.0% WACC, and a 3.5% terminal growth rate. These inputs are proximal to the forecasts and are generally well-justified. For instance, the WACC is transparently decomposed into its constituent parts (Risk-Free Rate, Beta, ERP) in the appendix, and the revenue growth is contextualized against the company's 'land and expand' strategy and recent performance. Internal consistency is high; the narrative explains the dip in GAAP operating margins for FY25 (due to the July 19 incident) which is accurately reflected in the financial snapshot table. However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. Despite assigning a 'High' uncertainty rating and identifying significant operational risks, the analyst does not provide a range of outcomes or a sensitivity matrix (e.g., varying WACC or growth rates) to show the impact on the $310.00 fair value estimate. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers triggers a hard cap, limiting the maximum possible grade to 'Fair'.",

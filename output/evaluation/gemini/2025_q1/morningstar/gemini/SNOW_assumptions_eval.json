    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to the combination of a material internal contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis, which triggers a mandatory hard cap. While the analyst provides explicit point-estimates for key drivers\u2014including product revenue growth (28.5% for FY26), Net Revenue Retention (122-124%), and a detailed WACC calculation (8.8%)\u2014it fails to stress-test these assumptions. There are no quantified scenarios or sensitivity tables showing how the $210.00 Fair Value Estimate would change under different growth or margin assumptions, leaving the valuation as a 'black box.'\n\nCrucially, the report contains a significant numeric contradiction regarding its cash flow narrative. It repeatedly highlights 'significant operating leverage' and 'FCF margin expansion,' yet its own data (Section 11) shows that FY2025 actual FCF margins were 29.0%, while the FY2026 estimate is only 25.0%. Describing a 400-basis-point year-over-year decline as 'expansion' (Section 5 and Section 8) is logically inconsistent and undermines the credibility of the forward-looking model. Furthermore, while the analyst justifies the WACC components, the lack of a bull/bear case or a sensitivity matrix for a 'High' uncertainty asset violates the core requirements for high-quality research. The specificity of the inputs is noted, but it cannot compensate for the lack of internal coherence and the failure to provide a range of outcomes for material drivers.",

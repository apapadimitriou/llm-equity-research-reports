        "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high explicitness and specificity regarding its core valuation inputs. Key drivers, including a 10% revenue CAGR and a 46% terminal operating margin, are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform. Justification is solid, as the analyst anchors these projections in management\u2019s '2030 Ambition' and the firm's Q4 2024 organic growth exit rates. Specificity is a strength, with clear units, magnitudes, and a five-year time horizon provided for all major model inputs. Internal consistency is generally maintained between the narrative and the financial summary table, though a minor numeric discrepancy exists regarding the tax rate: the WACC calculation utilizes a 21% corporate tax rate, while the Appendix and management guidance cite a 25% adjusted tax rate for 2025. The primary deficiency that prevents a higher grade is the total lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While the report identifies material risks\u2014such as market beta, fee compression, and M&A integration\u2014it fails to provide quantified ranges or impact assessments on the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) for any of these drivers. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a hard cap of 'Fair'.",

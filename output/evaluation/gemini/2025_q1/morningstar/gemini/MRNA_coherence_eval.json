    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits exceptional coherence, maintaining a seamless narrative arc that transitions from immediate quarterly performance to a long-term strategic 'metamorphosis.' The language is clear and professional, with sophisticated connective tissue linking disparate sections. For instance, the 'Analyst Note' introduces the 'Valley of Death' concept, which is then rigorously supported by the 'Business Strategy' section and quantitatively validated in the 'Financials Snapshot' table, showing negative operating margins and free cash flow through 2027. Internal consistency is a significant strength; the report proactively resolves potential tensions, such as the high Q3 2025 revenue ($1.02 billion) relative to the full-year estimate ($1.8 billion), by explaining the 'earlier-than-anticipated timing' of vaccine stocking. This level of detail ensures the narrative and tables are perfectly aligned. Furthermore, the 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' arguments are not merely listed but are integrated into the 'Fair Value' and 'Risk' sections. The bullish oncology thesis is tempered by a 60% probability of success in the valuation model, while the bearish litigation concerns are detailed with specific temporal markers, such as the March 2026 trial. Temporal claims are precise and accurate relative to the December 8, 2025, report date. Terminology is applied accurately, and the 'None' Economic Moat rating is well-defended with quantitative evidence of negative ROIC relative to the stated WACC.",
    "evidence": [
        "The 'Valley of Death' narrative in the Strategy section is quantitatively supported by Table 1, showing negative operating margins (-290% to -40%) and FCF through 2027.",
        "The Analyst Note reconciles the Q3 revenue beat ($1.02B) with the lower FY2025 guidance ($1.8B) by citing 'earlier-than-anticipated timing' of vaccine stocking.",
        "The Bear case regarding patent litigation is explicitly integrated into the Risk section, citing a specific March 2026 trial date and potential $1B+ liability."

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits a high degree of structural sophistication and narrative flow, successfully connecting Snowflake\u2019s technical shift toward Apache Iceberg and AI Cortex with its broader economic moat and valuation. The language is clear, and the transitions between the strategic outlook and the 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' sections are logically sound. However, the report is subject to a mandatory downgrade to 'fair' due to a glaring temporal contradiction: the document is dated May 28, 2025, yet the 'Works Cited' section lists multiple sources as being accessed on December 15, 2025. This internal inconsistency undermines the report's credibility as a contemporaneous analysis. Furthermore, there is an unresolved tension regarding the Free Cash Flow (FCF) trajectory. The Analyst Note highlights an 18% FCF margin for Q1 FY26 as evidence of an 'emerging' profile, yet Table 1 shows that FY25 actually achieved a much higher 29% margin. The narrative fails to reconcile why a drop to 18% in Q1 is viewed as a positive inflection point or how the company will achieve the 25% full-year estimate provided in the financials table. While the cross-referencing between the 'Economic Moat' and competitive risks is excellent, these chronological and numerical discrepancies violate the requirements for a higher grade.",

        "Report Date of May 28, 2025, contradicts the 'Works Cited' access dates of December 15, 2025 (Section 1 vs. Sources).",
        "Analyst Note cites an 18% FCF margin in Q1 as a strength, despite Table 1 showing a decline from the 29% margin achieved in FY25.",
        "The Strategy section effectively cross-references the 'Iceberg' shift as a defensive move against the bear case for vendor lock-in (Section 5)."

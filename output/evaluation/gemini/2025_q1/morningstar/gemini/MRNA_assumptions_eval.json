    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high quality in explicitness, justification, and specificity, but is strictly capped at 'Fair' due to the total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. Assumptions regarding revenue troughs, R&D cost reductions, and pipeline Probability of Success (POS) are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform. The analyst provides solid justification for these inputs, citing management's updated guidance, onshoring strategies for margin expansion, and specific Phase 2 clinical data for oncology assets. Specificity is strong, with clear magnitudes ($1.1B R&D cut), time horizons (2025\u20132029), and units. Internal consistency is excellent; the narrative regarding cash flow breakeven by 2028 and operating margin trajectories reconciles perfectly with the 'Financials Snapshot' table and the 'Key Valuation Assumptions Table.' However, despite the 'Very High' uncertainty rating and the binary nature of the oncology pipeline, the report fails to provide quantified ranges or alternative valuation outcomes (e.g., a 'failure case' price target). Per the grading instructions, the lack of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers like INT success or WACC necessitates a 'Fair' grade regardless of the report's otherwise high transparency and logical coherence.",

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a professional narrative structure and clear thematic pillars, particularly regarding the 'Blackwell Supercycle' and 'Sovereign AI.' However, it suffers from severe temporal and internal contradictions that trigger mandatory grading caps. The most glaring issue is the chronological impossibility of the source material: the report is dated April 16, 2025, yet the 'Works Cited' section lists access dates in December 2025. Furthermore, the report cites 'Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2026' (Source 19), an event that would not occur until months after the report\u2019s publication date. Internal data consistency is also compromised. In Section 9.2, the analyst uses a $5.00 FY2027 EPS estimate, labeling it the 'conservative end of consensus.' However, Section 6.3 explicitly defines the consensus range for FY2027 EPS as $5.72 to $6.90, making the $5.00 figure an outlier rather than the conservative bound of the stated range. While the narrative flow is 'good' in terms of transitions and the reconciliation of the 'air pocket' bear case with the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' logic, these structural and temporal failures are disqualifying for a higher grade. The reader is presented with a polished argument that relies on data points and sources that are either internally inconsistent or factually impossible within the report's own timeline. Consequently, per the grading guardrails, the report is capped at 'fair.'",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is downgraded to poor due to multiple unresolved contradictions and significant temporal inaccuracies that undermine the credibility of the analysis. While the narrative flow is sophisticated, the Works Cited section contains access dates from December 2025, which is logically impossible for a report dated May 1, 2025. This temporal misalignment extends to specific citations referencing dividend payments in September 2025 as historical data. Furthermore, there is a fundamental contradiction between the valuation assumptions and the risk narrative. The Bear Case explicitly identifies a Depreciation Wall from the $70 billion Capex spend as a structural headwind to margins in 2026\u20132028. However, the DCF model in Section 6.1 ignores this, projecting operating margin expansion to 42\u201344% by 2027 without providing any offsetting revenue or cost-efficiency justification. This lack of reconciliation between the High Risk capital intensity and the optimistic margin recovery projections represents a failure in structural coherence. Additionally, while the report claims the Year of Efficiency has ended, it fails to reconcile how the company will maintain operational discipline while nearly doubling Capex. Because the reader must resolve these tensions between the aggressive infrastructure spend and the optimistic margin targets themselves, the report fails the coherence standard.",

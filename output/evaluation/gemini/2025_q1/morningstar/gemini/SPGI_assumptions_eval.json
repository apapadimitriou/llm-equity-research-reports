    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high quality in explicitness, justification, and specificity, but is ultimately capped at 'Fair' due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. Assumptions are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform, particularly in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix. The analyst provides solid justification for key drivers, citing the 2025 Investor Day targets, historical merger synergies from IHS Markit, and specific macroeconomic benchmarks like the 10-year Treasury yield for the risk-free rate. Specificity is a strength, with clearly defined magnitudes (e.g., 50\u201375 bps annual margin expansion), units, and time horizons (2025\u20132029). Internal consistency is maintained throughout; the financial snapshot tables reconcile with the narrative growth targets and the share repurchase strategy. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. While it identifies material risks\u2014such as debt issuance volatility and regulatory shifts\u2014it offers only qualitative 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' arguments. There are no quantified sensitivity tables, range-based valuation outputs, or scenario-modeled impacts for critical levers like WACC, revenue growth, or the Mobility spin-off execution. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a 'Fair' grade regardless of the strength of other sections.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates solid analytical depth by establishing clear causal links between operational events and financial outcomes. It specifically quantifies the impact of the July 19 incident, citing a '$30 million per quarter subscription revenue headwind' and '$33 million in direct costs' across specific segments. The reasoning regarding the company's 'Narrow Moat' is mechanism-rich, explaining how the 'single lightweight-agent architecture' creates high switching costs and how the 'Security Cloud' facilitates a network effect. Assumptions are explicit and partially benchmarked; for instance, the '3.5% terminal growth rate' is tied to 'nominal global GDP,' and the 22% revenue CAGR is contextualized against the current 29% growth rate. The report provides a transparent 10-year DCF framework with quantified drivers for margins and WACC. However, it falls short of an 'Excellent' grade because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it acknowledges 'High Uncertainty' and identifies risks like 'multiple compression,' it does not provide a valuation range or demonstrate how the fair value estimate would shift under alternative growth or margin scenarios. Verbatim excerpts illustrating this depth include: 'revenue headwind... due to \"customer commitment packages\"', 'single agent... also represents a single point of failure', 'terminal growth... in line with nominal global GDP', '3-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model', and '9.0% weighted average cost of capital (WACC)'.",

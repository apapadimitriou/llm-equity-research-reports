    "grade": "good",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'good' grade due to its strong narrative cohesion and proactive reconciliation of conflicting market signals. The Analyst Note effectively bridges the gap between the 'double beat' in Q1 2025 results and the subsequent share price decline, framing the conservative Q2 operating income guidance as a strategic investment in AI infrastructure rather than a fundamental weakness. This narrative is consistently supported across the Business Strategy and Fair Value sections, where the analyst links high-margin AWS growth to long-term consolidated margin expansion. Structurally, the report excels at cross-referencing. For instance, the Economic Moat section specifically cites the 'Amazon Q' product mentioned in the Strategy section as a driver of high switching costs. The valuation model is transparent, with the 5-year revenue CAGR (11.2%) and terminal growth assumptions aligning well with the provided financial snapshot. While there is a minor mathematical discrepancy in the WACC calculation (the components sum to 9.57% while the report states 9.50%), it does not materially undermine the core argument. Furthermore, the report handles temporal anomalies in the source data\u2014specifically future-dated ESG snippets\u2014by explicitly acknowledging the 5/2/25 cut-off, thereby maintaining internal logic. The Bulls and Bears cases are not merely listed but are integrated into the base-case valuation narrative, satisfying the requirement for reconciliation.",

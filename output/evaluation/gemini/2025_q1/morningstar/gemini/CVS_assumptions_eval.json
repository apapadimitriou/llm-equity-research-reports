        "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the minimum standards for high-quality assumptions due to two critical 'Hard Cap' violations. First, there is a significant internal numeric contradiction regarding the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). In the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section and the Appendix, the WACC is stated as 6.77% (derived from a 7.81% cost of equity). However, in the 'Bears Say' and 'Economic Moat' sections, the report explicitly states the WACC is 4.76% to support the argument that the company's 4.15% ROIC is value-destructive. This unresolved discrepancy between the valuation model and the narrative conclusion is a major consistency failure. Second, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers. While it qualitatively discusses risks such as PBM regulatory reform and Medicare Advantage rate pressures, it provides no quantified ranges or 'what-if' scenarios showing how changes in margins, terminal growth, or discount rates would impact the $86.00 Fair Value Estimate. Assumptions for revenue growth and terminal value are largely justified by 'analyst consensus' or 'management guidance' rather than independent historical benchmarking or peer comparison. The combination of a material numeric contradiction and the total absence of quantified stress-testing necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

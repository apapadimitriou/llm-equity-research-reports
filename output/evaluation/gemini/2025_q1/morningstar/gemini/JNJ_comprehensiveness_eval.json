    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all required headline sections and demonstrates strong evidence integration with extensive, consistent in-text citations. However, it is capped at 'Fair' due to several structural and content deficiencies. First, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits at least two core sector-specific KPIs: Free Cash Flow (critical for a DCF-based valuation and a 'Dividend King') and R&D Expense (the primary operating driver for Innovative Medicine). While segment revenue is provided, segment-level operating margins are absent from the data tables. Second, the report exhibits significant redundancy; the 'Stelara Cliff' and 'MedTech M&A' narratives are repeated across the Analyst Note, Business Description, Strategy, and Valuation sections with minimal incremental depth, triggering a mandatory downgrade. Third, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking section and any form of scenario or sensitivity analysis, which are essential for higher grades. While the valuation section mentions operating drivers, the lack of a sensitivity table (e.g., for WACC or the talc settlement amount) limits the comprehensiveness of the risk-adjusted fair value estimate.",

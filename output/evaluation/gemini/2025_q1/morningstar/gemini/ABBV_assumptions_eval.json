    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions that are closely aligned with management's 2025 guidance and 2027 long-term targets. Key drivers, including revenue segments (Immunology, Neuroscience, Oncology), adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow, are clearly stated with magnitudes and time horizons. Justification is solid, as the analyst anchors the model to recent SEC filings and earnings call transcripts. Internal consistency is maintained between the narrative and the financial snapshot table. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While the analyst identifies material risks\u2014such as the high-risk M&A strategy and biosimilar erosion\u2014there are no quantified ranges or 'what-if' scenarios showing how changes in WACC, terminal growth, or key drug sales would impact the fair value estimate. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers mandates a maximum grade of 'Fair'. Additionally, the justification for the projected jump in adjusted operating margin from 21.1% in 2024 to 47.0% in 2025 is weak; although the report notes a change in reporting metrics ('normalized' vs 'adjusted'), it provides no bridge to reconcile this massive discrepancy, making the margin expansion feel somewhat opaque.",

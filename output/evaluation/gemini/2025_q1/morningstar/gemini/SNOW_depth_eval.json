    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to explain the underlying drivers of Snowflake\u2019s performance. It provides robust causal reasoning, particularly regarding the 'Data Gravity' effect where \"customers who optimized storage... are now increasing compute intensity\" to derive value. The analyst explicitly links strategic shifts, such as the embrace of Apache Iceberg, to financial outcomes, noting it \"may cannibalize some storage revenue... defends high-margin compute.\" Inference quality is high, with forecasts for FY2026\u20132029 tied to specific catalysts like the Cortex AI suite and international expansion. The report uses data effectively, providing a detailed financials snapshot and explicit DCF inputs, including a \"WACC of 8.8%... incorporates a Beta of 1.09.\" Assumptions are benchmarked, such as the \"terminal growth rate of 3.5%... faster than nominal GDP.\" While the report identifies significant counterpoints and risks (e.g., Databricks competition and hyperscaler 'frenemy' dynamics), it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or multi-case scenario modeling. It notes that the \"market is pricing in a sharper deceleration (to <15% growth)\" compared to the analyst's 28.5% estimate, but does not provide a range of fair values based on varying inputs. Consequently, while the reasoning is mechanism-rich and actionable, the absence of stress-testing or quantified scenarios limits the grade to Good.",

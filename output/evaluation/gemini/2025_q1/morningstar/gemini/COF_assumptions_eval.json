    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions assessment due to critical internal contradictions and a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. Most significantly, there is a total disconnect between the narrative and the data tables: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section explicitly claims to model 2025 NIM compression and elevated expenses, yet the 'Financials Snapshot' table lists 'Insufficient data' for every single metric from 2025 through 2029. This unresolved numeric contradiction violates a hard cap for the grading scale. Furthermore, the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) of $153.00 is dated February 20, 2024, making it over a year old relative to the March 31, 2025 report date. This creates a temporal mismatch where the valuation ignores the massive $35.3 billion Discover acquisition, even though the analyst note identifies this deal as the primary driver of the stock's current market premium. While the report provides a specific Cost of Equity (CoE) breakdown using CAPM, it offers no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario ranges for material drivers like credit losses or NIM, despite assigning the company a 'High' uncertainty rating. The absence of these stress tests, combined with the failure to provide forecast magnitudes in the financial tables, renders the valuation a 'black box' that lacks the transparency and consistency required for a higher grade.",

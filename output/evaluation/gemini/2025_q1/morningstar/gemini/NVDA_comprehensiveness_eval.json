    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, covering all required sections including an Executive Summary, Business Strategy, Moat analysis, and ESG. It provides a strong qualitative narrative regarding the 'Blackwell' architecture and the 'Sovereign AI' thesis. However, the report fails the comprehensiveness test due to significant temporal contradictions and data gaps. The report is dated April 16, 2025, yet the 'Works Cited' section lists access dates in December 2025 and references financial results for Q2 Fiscal 2026 (Source 19), which would not have occurred by the report's date. This logical impossibility violates the requirement for consistent and valid evidence. Furthermore, while the report includes high-level financial metrics, the 'Financials Snapshot' is generic and omits critical semiconductor-specific KPIs such as R&D intensity, inventory levels, and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO). Although the valuation section successfully links operating drivers (Blackwell ramp) to the DCF outcome, the lack of formal peer benchmarking tables and the absence of a sensitivity/scenario analysis table prevents the report from achieving a higher grade. Per the decision rules, the impossible citations and missing core KPIs cap the grade at 'Fair'.",

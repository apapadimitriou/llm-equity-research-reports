    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails the quality of assumptions criteria primarily due to a significant internal contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. A major numeric discrepancy exists between the 'Target Price' of $210.00 listed in the header and the 'Fair Value Estimate' of $195.00 detailed in the valuation section (Section 7.1). Per the grading rubric, a single contradiction combined with a lack of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade. While the report identifies key drivers such as mid-cycle ROE (14%), Cost of Equity (9.0%), and NII trends, these inputs are weakly justified. The 9.0% Cost of Equity is stated without a risk-free rate or beta derivation, and the 6% tangible book value growth is presented without historical reconciliation. Furthermore, while the report mentions 'adverse scenarios' regarding unemployment (4.5%\u20135.0%), it fails to provide any quantified sensitivity tables or ranges showing how changes in these material drivers would impact the EPS or the target price. The valuation feels like a 'black box' where the narrative of a 'Fortress Balance Sheet' is disconnected from the specific math used to derive the intrinsic value.",

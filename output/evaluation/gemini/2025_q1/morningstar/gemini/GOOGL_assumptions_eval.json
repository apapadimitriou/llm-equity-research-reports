    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the standard for 'Good' or 'Fair' due to a combination of internal numeric contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report is explicit in stating its DCF and P/E valuation inputs, it contains a significant internal contradiction regarding segment revenues: it identifies 'Google Services' revenue as $77.3 billion while simultaneously attributing that same $77.3 billion figure to the 'Search & Other' sub-segment. Because 'Search & Other' is a component of 'Google Services' (which also includes YouTube and other platforms), these figures cannot be identical, creating an unresolved numeric conflict. Furthermore, the report violates a hard cap by providing only qualitative risk assessments rather than quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers such as WACC, terminal growth, or regulatory impact. Although the report justifies some assumptions using Q1 2025 results and historical context, the lack of a stress-tested model and the presence of logical errors in the revenue breakdown render the outputs 'black-box' in nature. Per the grading instructions, the presence of one distinct contradiction combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded poor due to significant internal contradictions and a total failure of temporal coherence. The most glaring issue is the inconsistent application of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The Bears Say and Economic Moat sections utilize a 4.76% WACC to demonstrate that the company is destroying value (ROIC < WACC). Conversely, the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section and the Appendix table explicitly state a WACC of 6.77% was used for the DCF valuation. This 201-basis-point gap is an unresolved contradiction that undermines the entire financial argument. Furthermore, the report exhibits a breakdown in temporal logic. Although the report is dated March 31, 2025, the Sources section includes multiple citations with access dates in November 2025 and references to Q2 2025 results (May 2025). This is particularly jarring as the ESG Risk section correctly identifies that data from September 2025 falls outside the data cut-off, yet the bibliography ignores this constraint. Additionally, the narrative cites an ROIC of 4.15% in the Moat section, which does not match the 4.2% figure provided in the Financials Snapshot table. These misalignments between narrative, tables, and citations require the reader to assemble the argument themselves, fitting the poor rubric.",

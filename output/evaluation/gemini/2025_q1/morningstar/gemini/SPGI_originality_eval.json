    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original synthesis or independent thesis, functioning instead as a summary of S&P Global\u2019s 2025 Investor Day and public corporate announcements. Every 'insight' identified is a restatement of management's stated strategic pillars (e.g., the Mobility spin-off, private markets expansion, and AI integration) or standard industry knowledge (e.g., the Ratings duopoly and the secular shift to passive investing). There is no evidence of the analyst linking disparate data points to reach a unique conclusion; for instance, the margin expansion targets and revenue growth rates are taken directly from management guidance without independent verification or stress-testing. The valuation section is a boilerplate DCF that utilizes standard inputs and management's own targets as the primary drivers, lacking any novel mechanism or proprietary angle. Furthermore, the report relies heavily on third-party frameworks (Morningstar\u2019s Moat and Uncertainty ratings) rather than developing an original analytical lens. Because the report contains zero original syntheses or theses and consists entirely of paraphrased public information and generic sector descriptions, it meets the criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",

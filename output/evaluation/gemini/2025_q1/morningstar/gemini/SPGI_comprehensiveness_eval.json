    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound and provides high-quality qualitative analysis, particularly regarding the 'Wide' economic moat and the strategic rationale for the Mobility segment spin-off. It includes all required headline sections and maintains consistent in-text citations. However, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and the absence of quantitative scenario analysis. Specifically, the Financials Snapshot is generic, providing only high-level financial metrics (Revenue, EPS, FCF) while omitting critical sector-specific KPIs such as Debt Issuance Volumes (Ratings), Assets Under Management (Indices), and Subscription Retention Rates (Market Intelligence). While these are mentioned in the text, their absence from the multi-year forecast table triggers a hard cap. Furthermore, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking table and quantitative sensitivity analysis (e.g., a WACC/Growth matrix). There is also notable redundancy, with the Mobility spin-off and moat characteristics repeated across nearly every section without adding significant new depth in each instance.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to meet the required standards for the quality of assumptions due to significant internal contradictions and a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the report explicitly states key valuation inputs such as revenue CAGR (16%), WACC (9.0%), and terminal growth (3.5%), these figures are not robustly justified. Specifically, the WACC is presented as a point estimate without a supporting CAPM build-up or peer cost-of-capital benchmarking. A critical numeric contradiction exists between the valuation narrative and the financial tables: Section 8.1 models Non-GAAP operating margins expanding to ~32% by FY29, whereas the Financial Snapshot in Section 11 forecasts a 36.0% margin for the same year. This 400-basis-point discrepancy suggests the DCF model and the financial statements are not internally coherent. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers like NGS ARR growth or platformization conversion rates, relying instead on purely qualitative risk descriptions. Per the grading instructions, the combination of a material numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities triggers a 'Poor' rating. The specificity of the assumptions (units and horizons) is 'Solid,' but this does not outweigh the failures in consistency and stress-testing.",

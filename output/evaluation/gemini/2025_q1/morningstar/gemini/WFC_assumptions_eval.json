    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit key assumptions for its valuation and financial forecasts, including a 9.5% cost of equity, a 3.0% terminal growth rate, and a 63% efficiency ratio target for 2026. These are proximal to the conclusions and use specific units and time horizons. However, the justification for the valuation parameters (WACC/COE) is weak, as they are presented as point estimates without a breakdown of components like beta or equity risk premium. While the report includes a 'Risk Factors' section that quantifies some impacts\u2014such as net charge-offs rising to 6\u20137% in a hard landing and a potential de-rating to $76\u2014it lacks a robust, systematic sensitivity analysis or scenario table for its primary valuation model. A notable internal inconsistency exists between the cited 15.7% five-year EPS growth rate and the report's own 2025\u20132026 forecast, which implies a lower growth rate of approximately 10.9%. Because the sensitivity analysis is limited to qualitative descriptions with only isolated quantified points, and because the valuation inputs lack evidence-rich justification (e.g., peer WACC comps), the report is capped at 'Fair' per the grading instructions.",

    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional coherence, maintaining a consistent narrative arc from the regulatory 'liberation' of June 2025 through to its 2026 financial projections. The language is clear and professional, with sophisticated transitions that link disparate sections\u2014such as connecting the removal of the asset cap to specific operational shifts in the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) and the subsequent impact on the efficiency ratio. A major strength is the proactive resolution of internal tensions. For instance, the report explicitly questions why the efficiency ratio deteriorated despite revenue growth, attributing it to the shift toward fee-based income and lingering AML compliance costs. This level of internal cross-referencing ensures the reader is not left to reconcile conflicting data points. The tables are perfectly integrated into the narrative; the CRE Office Exposure table (Table 3) is directly supported by a 'kitchen sink' reserving argument in the text. Temporal claims are precise and consistent with the mid-December 2025 'current' date. The report correctly identifies the asset cap removal as a past event while projecting its long-term effects into 2026. Terminology, such as the distinction between Net Interest Income (NII) and Net Interest Margin (NIM), is applied accurately. The reconciliation of the 'Neutral' rating with the 'improvement story' premium in the valuation section provides a balanced, connected argument that justifies the final investment conclusion.",
    "evidence": [
        "The immediate impact is the restoration of the bank's ability to compete for scale... The bank can now aggressively bid for large corporate treasury mandates (Section 2.2).",
        "Why is efficiency worsening (64% to 65%) when revenue is growing? The answer lies in the mix... Fee-based revenue comes with higher compensation expenses (Section 4.3).",
        "Table 3 (CRE Office Exposure) coverage ratios are explicitly reconciled with management's 'kitchen sink' reserving strategy in Section 6.2."

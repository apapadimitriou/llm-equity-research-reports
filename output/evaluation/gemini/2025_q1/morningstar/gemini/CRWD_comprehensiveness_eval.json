    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a structured overview of CrowdStrike but fails to meet the requirements for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating due to significant gaps in sector-specific data and comparative analysis. While the report includes essential sections like the Analyst Note and Economic Moat, the Financials Snapshot is generic and omits critical SaaS KPIs such as Net Retention Rate (NRR) and customer count, which are vital for evaluating software growth. Per the instruction's hard caps, the omission of these core KPIs in the snapshot limits the grade to 'Fair'. Furthermore, the report lacks a dedicated peer benchmarking section or table, providing no relative valuation context against competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Zscaler. Redundancy is a significant issue; the July 19 operational incident is repeated across seven different sections (Analyst Note, Bulls/Bears, Moat, Valuation, Risk, Capital Allocation, and ESG) with minimal incremental depth, triggering a mandatory downgrade. Finally, the absence of scenario or sensitivity analysis in the valuation section prevents the report from reaching a higher tier of comprehensiveness.",

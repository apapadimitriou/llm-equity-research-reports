    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions for its valuation model, including a 10-year DCF horizon, a 9.4% WACC (justified by a 4.34% risk-free rate and 1.04 Beta), and a 4.0% terminal growth rate. Key causal drivers, such as the Blackwell architecture ramp, Sovereign AI demand, and software monetization ($4,500/GPU for NIMs), are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform. The financial figures within the text and tables are internally consistent, with FY2026 revenue growth (+50%) reconciling to the provided consensus ranges. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material drivers. While it qualitatively discusses risks like China export controls and supply chain bottlenecks, it fails to provide a range of outcomes or a sensitivity matrix (e.g., WACC vs. Terminal Growth) to show how these variables impact the $150 target price. Additionally, there is a significant temporal contradiction: the report is dated April 2025, yet the 'Works Cited' section references dates in December 2025, indicating a failure in internal consistency and document integrity. Without quantified stress-testing of the primary revenue and margin levers, the outputs remain a 'black box' point estimate.",

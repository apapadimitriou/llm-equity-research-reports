    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides exhaustive coverage of Mastercard, meeting all criteria for an 'Excellent' grade. It includes every required section, from a strategic executive summary to a detailed ESG profile. Proportionality is well-executed, with significant depth dedicated to the 'Value-Added Services' (VAS) pivot, which is correctly identified as the primary growth driver. Evidence integration is superior, utilizing 40 distinct sources with consistent in-text citations throughout the document. Sector-specific KPIs\u2014including Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), Switched Transactions, and Cross-Border Volume\u2014are present and integrated into the financial analysis. The valuation section is robust, providing a clear bridge from operating drivers (EPS growth and margin expansion) to a 12-month price target, further supported by explicit Bull and Bear scenario analyses. Peer benchmarking against Visa and the S&P 500 provides essential market context. There is no superficial redundancy; while core themes like VAS and regulatory risks are recurring, each mention adds specific strategic, financial, or legal granularity. No material gaps or uncited claims were identified.",

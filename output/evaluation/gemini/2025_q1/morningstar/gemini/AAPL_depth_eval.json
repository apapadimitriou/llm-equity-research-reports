    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a 'Good' level of analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to provide clear causal mechanisms for its forecasts. It explicitly links margin stability to a 'positive mix-shift toward the high-margin Services segment' while identifying specific 'regulatory-forced reductions to App Store commissions' as a primary headwind. The valuation is supported by a transparent DCF framework with explicit assumptions, including a 'WACC of 7.98%' and a '5-year revenue CAGR of 6.8%.' These assumptions are benchmarked against 'analyst consensus' and 'global GDP growth expectations,' satisfying the requirement for grounded data use. However, the report falls short of an 'Excellent' grade due to the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it identifies a 'risk barbell' involving regulatory and geopolitical threats, it does not provide a range of fair value estimates or EPS outcomes based on varying levels of these risks (e.g., a specific 'Bear Case' valuation). The implications are actionable\u2014defining a 'ceiling' and 'floor' for the stock\u2014but the lack of stress-testing on key drivers like App Store commission rates or tariff percentages limits the depth of the uncertainty analysis. Verbatim excerpts: 'driven by the positive mix-shift toward high-margin Services', 'margin compression in Services from regulatory-forced reductions', 'Terminal growth ~2.5% (Long-term inflation and global GDP)', 'WACC of 7.98% is used to discount future cash flows', and 'significant regulatory and geopolitical overhangs create a ceiling'.",

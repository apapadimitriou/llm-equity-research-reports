    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report achieves a \"Good\" grade for its analytical depth. It provides clear causal mechanisms, such as linking the \"pricing power embedded in its Ratings business\" to revenue durability and the \"secular shift from active to passive investing\" to the growth of the Indices segment. Unlike purely descriptive reports, it offers explicit, quantified valuation assumptions, including a \"WACC of approximately 7.5%\" and a \"Terminal Growth Rate 3.5%,\" which is appropriately benchmarked as a \"Proxy for nominal GDP growth.\" The report also includes a structured \"Bulls Say / Bears Say\" section that explores counterpoints like \"sensitivity to issuance volumes\" and \"regulatory & legal risks.\" However, it falls short of an \"Excellent\" rating because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it identifies that \"issuance volumes could dry up\" in a high-rate environment, it does not provide a specific financial impact (e.g., a 10% drop in issuance reducing EPS by a specific amount). The \"Risk & Uncertainty\" section remains qualitative, and the \"AI Pivot\" is described as a \"tangible commercial enabler\" without a quantified mechanism for its impact on margins or revenue. According to the grading rules, a report with explicit, benchmarked assumptions and causal reasoning but no quantified scenario analysis is capped at \"Good.\"",

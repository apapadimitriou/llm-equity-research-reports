    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high analytical depth by moving beyond descriptive financial reporting to explain the underlying causal mechanisms of Meta\u2019s \"AI Infrastructure Supercycle.\" It provides a clear causal link between AI investment and ad pricing power, noting that a \"10% increase in average price per ad\" validates the strategy. The author explicitly outlines the \"flywheel\" effect where \"AI improves ad performance... generates cash to buy more GPUs.\" Valuation is supported by explicit, quantified assumptions including a \"WACC of 9.2%... Terminal Growth: 3.5%,\" which are benchmarked against peer growth profiles and historical multiples. The report includes a robust \"Bulls vs. Bears\" section that addresses uncertainty, specifically quantifying a regulatory scenario where \"ARPU in Europe could drop by 50% or more.\" It also provides a relative valuation scenario where a \"re-rate to a 28x multiple... price would exceed $700.\" However, the report stops short of \"Excellent\" because it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix for its DCF model (e.g., varying WACC and terminal growth) and does not provide a quantified range for the final price target ($842). While it mentions that \"EPS could contract significantly\" under slower growth, it fails to quantify this specific downside impact on the valuation. Consequently, while the reasoning is mechanism-rich and actionable, the treatment of sensitivity is not sufficiently extensive to meet the highest grade.",

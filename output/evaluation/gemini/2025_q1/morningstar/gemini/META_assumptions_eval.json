    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s quality of assumptions is strictly capped at 'Fair' due to the total absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis, which is a mandatory requirement for a higher grade. While the analyst identifies significant material risks\u2014such as the 'Depreciation Wall' resulting from the $64\u201372 billion Capex ramp and regulatory threats in the EU\u2014these are discussed only qualitatively. There are no tables or ranges demonstrating how variations in WACC, terminal growth, or ad pricing would numerically impact the $842.00 price target.\n\nBeyond this omission, the assumptions are otherwise 'Good.' They are highly explicit, appearing in a dedicated valuation section (6.1) proximal to the DCF conclusions. The drivers are specific, providing a 5-year horizon for revenue (13% CAGR) and clear margin trajectories (38% compression in 2025, expanding to 42-44% by 2027). Justification is solid, anchoring revenue growth in the adoption of Advantage+ and Reels monetization, while the 9.2% WACC is explained by the company\u2019s net cash position and regulatory beta. Internal consistency is a strength; the narrative regarding the 'Infrastructure Supercycle' and its associated depreciation costs reconciles perfectly with the modeled margin dip in 2025. However, without quantified stress-testing of these material levers, the model remains a 'black box' regarding the margin of safety for the bullish thesis.",

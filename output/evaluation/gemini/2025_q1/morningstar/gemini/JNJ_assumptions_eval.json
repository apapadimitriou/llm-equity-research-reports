    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to multiple internal numeric contradictions and a total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material valuation drivers. While the report explicitly lists key DCF inputs such as WACC (7.5%), terminal growth (2.5%), and a 5-year revenue CAGR (5.5%), these figures fail the consistency check when compared against the provided financial tables. Specifically, the narrative in Section 6.1 forecasts MedTech growth of 7-8% and Innovative Medicine growth of 5-7% post-2025. However, the data in Table 9.1 implies significantly lower CAGRs of approximately 5.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the consolidated 5.5% revenue CAGR claimed in the DCF assumptions is mathematically inconsistent with the 5.07% CAGR derived from the 2025\u20132029 revenue estimates ($93.7B to $114.2B).\n\nBeyond these contradictions, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. Despite identifying high-impact risks like the talc litigation and the 'Stelara cliff,' the analyst provides no quantified sensitivity matrix or scenario analysis (e.g., bull/bear cases or WACC/growth rate tables) to demonstrate how changes in these assumptions would impact the $227.00 price target. Per the grading rubric, the combination of two or more distinct contradictions and the lack of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade, as the model outputs function as a 'black box' that does not reconcile with the supporting narrative.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth by moving beyond simple description to explain the structural drivers of Amazon's profitability. The core causal argument\u2014that \"margin expansion is a structural consequence of a revenue mix-shift\"\u2014is well-supported by segment-level data showing the disparity between AWS (39.5% margin) and retail (3-6% margin). The author correctly identifies that \"AWS revenue growth accelerated to 17% Y/Y,\" acting as the primary \"profit engine.\" Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked; for instance, the \"WACC 9.5%\" is derived from a \"Risk-Free Rate: 4.255%\" (10-Year Treasury) and a specific \"Equity Risk Premium: 4.33%.\" The terminal growth rate of 3.0% is logically tied to \"Long-term inflation + real GDP growth.\" However, the report falls short of an \"Excellent\" grade due to a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. While it mentions risks like tariffs and AI capex, it does not calculate how a change in these variables would impact the \"$240.00 Fair Value Estimate.\" The implications are actionable, noting the \"post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity\" based on the fact that the \"FVE implies a Price/FVE ratio of 0.77,\" but the lack of stress-testing leaves the valuation's robustness unexamined.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally sound, covering all mandatory sections from the Analyst Note to ESG and Capital Allocation. It provides a clear narrative regarding Snowflake\u2019s transition to an AI-focused 'Data Cloud' and the strategic implications of Apache Iceberg. However, the report is strictly limited to a 'Fair' grade due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs within the Financials Snapshot table. While Net Revenue Retention (NRR) and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are mentioned in the narrative text, they are absent from the multi-year historical and forecast table, which instead focuses on generic financial metrics like EPS and Gross Margin. Furthermore, the report lacks a formal peer benchmarking table, relying instead on qualitative mentions of competitors like Databricks and the hyperscalers. The valuation section, while providing a clear DCF bridge and WACC breakdown, fails to include any scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., Bull/Bear cases or a WACC vs. Terminal Growth matrix), which is a requirement for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. There is also notable redundancy regarding the 'Iceberg' strategy, which is repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Moat sections without providing significantly different layers of depth. These gaps in quantitative benchmarking and sensitivity modeling, combined with the KPI omissions in the data tables, result in a comprehensive but ultimately 'Fair' evaluation.",

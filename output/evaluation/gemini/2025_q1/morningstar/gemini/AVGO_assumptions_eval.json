    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including revenue targets, EBITDA margins, and WACC components. These inputs are well-justified through a combination of management guidance, macroeconomic benchmarks (10-year Treasury), and historical segment performance (e.g., storage cyclicality). The internal consistency is high, with the narrative, appendix tables, and financial snapshot reconciling perfectly. However, the report fails the 'Stress-tested' pillar. Despite assigning a 'High Uncertainty' rating and identifying significant risks regarding VMware integration and AI concentration, the author provides zero quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling. There are no ranges provided for how changes in AI growth rates, synergy capture, or interest rates would impact the $1150.00 Fair-Value Estimate. Per the grading instructions, the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers necessitates a hard cap at 'Fair', regardless of the strength of the base-case justifications.",

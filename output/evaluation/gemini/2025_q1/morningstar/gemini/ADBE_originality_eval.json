    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report fails to provide any original insights, functioning primarily as a summary of public company disclosures and consensus financial data. Every major 'insight' presented is either a direct paraphrase of management's narrative or a restatement of standard industry tropes. For example, the 'Customer Experience Orchestration' (CXO) strategy is taken directly from the March 18, 2025, Investor Meeting, and the $125 million AI ARR figure is a verbatim data point from the Q1 2025 earnings call. The report lacks any synthesis of disparate data points; it mentions competitive threats from Canva and OpenAI but fails to quantify their impact or provide a unique angle on how Adobe's specific product architecture might resist them beyond repeating company marketing about 'commercially safe' models. Furthermore, the valuation section is entirely derivative, explicitly stating that the Fair Value Estimate is driven by 'consensus growth expectations' and management's own margin targets rather than any novel analyst-derived drivers. Because the report contains zero original theses or syntheses and relies on generic sector framing regarding moats and switching costs, it meets the hard-cap criteria for a 'Poor' grade.",

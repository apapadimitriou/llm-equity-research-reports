    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report includes all required structural sections, but the depth of analysis and data completeness are insufficient for a higher grade. A significant deficiency is found in the Financials Snapshot, where historical data for EPS, FCF, and ROIC (2022\u20132024) are marked as 'n/a', leaving the report without a verified historical baseline. While the report identifies sector-specific KPIs for AWS (revenue growth and operating margins), it omits other critical metrics such as Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) for retail and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) for AWS. Furthermore, the report lacks any form of peer benchmarking or industry context, failing to compare Amazon's performance against competitors like Microsoft Azure or Walmart. There is also no scenario or sensitivity analysis to stress-test the DCF valuation assumptions. Redundancy is noted as the AWS margin expansion and AI investment thesis are repeated across the Analyst Note, Strategy, and Valuation sections without providing incremental depth. These omissions and the lack of historical financial context cap the grade at Fair.",

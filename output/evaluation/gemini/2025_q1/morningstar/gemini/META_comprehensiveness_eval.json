    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong narrative depth and consistent evidence integration, particularly regarding Meta\u2019s AI pivot and regulatory challenges. However, it fails to meet several core requirements for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade. Most significantly, the 'Financials Snapshot' is inadequate; it provides only a year-over-year comparison for a single quarter (Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024) and entirely omits the required multi-year historical data and forward-looking financial forecast tables. While sector-specific KPIs like ad pricing and impression growth are mentioned in the text and impact analysis, they are absent from the primary data tables, and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)\u2014a critical social media metric\u2014is not tabulated. Furthermore, the report exhibits significant redundancy, repeating the $64\u201372 billion Capex guidance and the 'AI Infrastructure Supercycle' narrative across three separate sections (Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and Capital Allocation) with minimal incremental depth. Finally, the absence of a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., a table showing price target sensitivity to WACC or revenue growth) prevents the report from achieving a higher rating despite its strong sourcing and peer benchmarking.",

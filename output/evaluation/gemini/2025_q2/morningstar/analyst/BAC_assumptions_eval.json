    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are explicitly stated and generally well-justified using historical performance (e.g., 10-year average ROTE of 12.5%) and peer benchmarking against JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. However, the report fails significantly on internal consistency and sensitivity analysis. A major numeric contradiction exists regarding Net Interest Income (NII) growth for 2025: the narrative forecasts 6.8% growth, while the 'Net Interest Income Growth %' row in the Valuation Model Summary table explicitly reports -1.5% growth, even though the raw NII dollar figures in that same table imply approximately 7.95% growth ($56,060M to $60,521M). Similar discrepancies appear in expense growth, where the text projects a 2.5% CAGR, but the 2025 table row shows 1.5%. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for Bank of America\u2019s specific material drivers, such as interest rate shifts (NIM) or credit loss fluctuations. While the methodology section mentions scenario analysis, no BAC-specific ranges or valuation impacts are provided in the narrative or tables. According to the grading rubric, the combination of multiple material numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

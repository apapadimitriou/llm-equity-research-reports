    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a mix of company-specific data points and generic sector analysis. It contains three notable syntheses: a quantified estimate of the stress capital buffer (SCB) decline (1.2 percentage points) following Fed stress tests, a segment-level breakdown of efficiency ratios (contrasting the 83% wealth management ratio against the 49% commercial ratio to explain consolidated performance), and a peer comparison of deposit funding mix (80% for Wells Fargo vs. 65% for rivals). These provide some decision-relevant specificity. However, the report is heavily anchored in restating public headlines, most notably the lifting of the asset cap in June 2025, which is treated as a primary but obvious catalyst. Much of the commentary regarding technology budgets, 'scale and diversification,' and asset sensitivity is generic to the large-cap banking sector. Furthermore, the valuation section lacks novel drivers, citing standard adjustments such as the 'time value of money' and 'pull-forward in cost savings.' Because more than three insights are classified as restated or generic, and the valuation mechanism is standard, the grade is capped at Fair per the instruction's hard caps.",

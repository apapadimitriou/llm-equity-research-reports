    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Fair' primarily due to a material numeric contradiction between the narrative and the financial tables, which triggers a hard cap on the grading scale. In the 'Analyst Notes' section (page 11), the author explicitly states that adjusted margins are expected to grow to the 'high-30% range' over the next five years. However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table (page 15) contradicts this, showing a 2029 forecast of 31.1% for Adjusted Net Margin and 32.4% for Adjusted EBITDA Margin. This discrepancy remains unresolved in the text.\n\nBeyond this inconsistency, the report performs well on explicitness and justification. Key drivers such as the 17% five-year revenue CAGR and the expansion of GAAP gross margins to the 'low-80s range' are clearly stated and supported by the strategic shift toward software-led revenue and vendor consolidation. The valuation parameters, including a 9.0% WACC and 20% long-run tax rate, are explicitly tabulated. However, the sensitivity analysis is limited. While the report provides a quantified 'bear case' ($159 FVE based on 16% growth), it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix or multi-variable stress testing, which is expected for a 'High' uncertainty rating. Furthermore, the share count forecast in the model remains flat despite the narrative discussing a $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk involving significant share issuance, though the analyst notes they are awaiting more details before updating the model.",

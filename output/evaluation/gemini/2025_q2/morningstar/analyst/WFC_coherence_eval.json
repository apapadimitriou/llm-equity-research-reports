    "reasoning": "The report provides a cohesive qualitative narrative regarding Wells Fargo's multiyear rebuild and its transition to 'offense' following the removal of the asset cap in June 2025. The Analyst Note from June 29 effectively integrates the most recent Federal Reserve stress test results into the broader investment thesis, and the sections generally flow logically from strategic outlook to moat analysis and valuation. However, the report contains significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the embedded financial tables that undermine its structural coherence. Specifically, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section cites a 2024 Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 2.74%, while the 'Valuation Model Summary' table lists it as 3.1%. More critically, the narrative projects Net Interest Income (NII) growth of 'about 1% in 2025,' but the table explicitly reports a '-9.0%' growth rate for that year. Interestingly, the absolute NII figures in the table ($48,468 million for 2025 vs. $47,676 million for 2024) actually imply a positive growth of 1.66%, suggesting the growth percentage row in the table is mathematically inconsistent with its own data. While the Bulls/Bears sections are well-reconciled with the overvaluation thesis, these quantitative discrepancies between the text and the data tables trigger a hard cap of 'fair' according to the grading rubric.",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative states 'NIM... to compress slightly to around 2.70% in 2025 from 2.74% in 2024' (Page 11) while the table shows 2024 NIM at 3.1% (Page 21).",
        "Text predicts 'NII growth of about 1% in 2025' (Page 12) whereas the table lists 'Net Interest Income Growth %' for 2025 as -9.0 (Page 21).",
        "The Analyst Note (June 29) correctly references the 'stress test results on Friday, June 27' and links them to the overvaluation thesis (Page 1)."

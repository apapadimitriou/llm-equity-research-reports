    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit assumptions for revenue growth across segments (EDA and IP), long-term margin expansion, and capital costs. Justification is primarily qualitative, linking growth to AI demand and the Ansys merger, though it lacks specific peer benchmarking for the 31% terminal margin target. Specificity is high regarding time horizons (5 and 10-year CAGRs) and units. However, the report fails significantly on consistency and sensitivity. There are at least two distinct numeric contradictions between the narrative and the valuation tables: the text forecasts a 12% five-year revenue CAGR, while the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table explicitly calculates a 10.3% CAGR for the same period. Additionally, the text cites a 22% operating margin for 2024, whereas the table reports 23.0%. Most critically, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for its primary drivers (revenue growth and margins), providing only qualitative discussion of risks like China exposure. According to the grading rubric, the combination of multiple internal contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade, as the outputs function as a 'black box' that does not reconcile with the provided data.",

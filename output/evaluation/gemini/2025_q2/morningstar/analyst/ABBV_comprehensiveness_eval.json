    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all required sections from the executive summary to detailed ESG and capital allocation analysis. It excels in providing sector-specific KPIs for the biopharma industry, including drug-level sales (Humira, Skyrizi, Rinvoq), pipeline trial data (ABBV-295, lutikizumab), and R&D productivity metrics. The valuation section explicitly links the fair value estimate increase from $176 to $184 to the updated growth trajectories of next-generation immunology drugs, satisfying the linkage requirement. Peer benchmarking is robust, appearing in both a valuation comparison table and an ESG risk context. Evidence integration is strong, with claims regarding drug pricing impacts and tariff headwinds supported by specific percentage estimates (e.g., a 24% hit to US drug revenue in a worst-case scenario). The 'Analyst Notes Archive' provides significant depth on regulatory scenarios, effectively serving as scenario analysis. However, the report is downgraded from 'Excellent' to 'Good' due to significant redundancy. The core narrative regarding Humira's biosimilar erosion and the Skyrizi/Rinvoq offset is repeated across the Business Strategy, Bulls Say, Economic Moat, Fair Value, and Analyst Note sections with minimal incremental depth. Additionally, while qualitative scenario analysis is excellent, the report lacks a formal quantitative sensitivity matrix (e.g., a table showing Fair Value sensitivity to WACC or terminal growth rates).",

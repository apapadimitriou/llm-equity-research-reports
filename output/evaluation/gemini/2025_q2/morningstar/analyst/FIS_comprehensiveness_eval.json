    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded as 'Fair' primarily due to the generic nature of the Financials Snapshot and significant internal redundancy. While the report provides exhaustive qualitative coverage of Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), including a detailed breakdown of its economic moat in core processing and a clear narrative regarding the Worldpay divestiture, it fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria on two technical fronts.\n\nFirst, the Financials Snapshot (Pages 12-13) utilizes a standardized template that omits critical sector-specific KPIs for a FinTech/Payments firm, specifically 'Organic Revenue Growth %' and 'Recurring Revenue %.' While these figures are discussed within the Analyst Notes, their absence from the primary data tables triggers a hard cap under the evaluation framework. Second, the report exhibits high redundancy; the 'Analyst Notes Archive' (Pages 6-9) repeats the same core talking points regarding the 4% revenue CAGR, management transitions, and the strategic rationale for the Worldpay sale across multiple entries without providing incremental depth.\n\nFurthermore, while the valuation section successfully links operating drivers (4% CAGR and 40 bps margin expansion) to the Fair Value Estimate, the report lacks a dedicated scenario or sensitivity analysis table within the text, which is required for higher grades. Peer benchmarking is present but limited to high-level valuation multiples and ESG metrics. Consequently, despite the strong qualitative analysis, the structural omissions and repetitive content limit the grade to Fair.",

    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality by moving beyond standard industry boilerplate to provide quantified, company-specific syntheses. The analyst provides a detailed impact analysis of US drug pricing policy, calculating a specific 24% hit to US revenue and identifying the Medicare hospital channel (10% of the market) as a likely containment zone to limit broader exposure. Furthermore, the report presents a strong original thesis regarding tax rate normalization, linking US manufacturing shifts and trade policy to a specific increase in the long-term tax rate from 15% to 21%. The valuation is supported by granular, time-bound projections for key assets, such as the $5 billion peak sales estimate for Tremfya by 2028 based on head-to-head clinical data, and a quantified $3 billion hit from Stelara biosimilars in 2025. The interpretation of the talc litigation strategy\u2014shifting from bankruptcy to the tort system\u2014adds a unique perspective on risk management, suggesting a lower total payout despite increased uncertainty. These insights are highly decision-relevant, providing specific numbers, catalysts, and causal mechanisms that distinguish this report from generic sector coverage.",

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a clear overall structure and a logical narrative arc, particularly in its qualitative assessment of Apple\u2019s ecosystem and competitive positioning. The Analyst Note and Business Strategy sections provide smooth transitions and effectively link the firm's hardware-software integration to its 'wide moat' status. However, the report suffers from significant quantitative contradictions between the narrative and the embedded financial tables. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (dated 29 May 2025) explicitly projects a 7% compound annual revenue growth rate through fiscal 2029, yet the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 15 lists the 5-Year CAGR for revenue as 6.0%. Similarly, the narrative forecasts operating margins reaching 35% by 2029, while the table shows 34.4%. There is also a notable temporal misalignment; the 'Economic Moat' section is dated February 2024 and describes the Apple Watch and AirPods as 'recent examples' of new products, a claim that is time-inaccurate for a report issued in June 2025. While the Bulls and Bears sections are successfully reconciled with the base-case valuation\u2014specifically regarding regulatory impacts on App Store margins\u2014the discrepancies between the text and the data tables violate the core requirement for internal consistency, triggering a hard cap at the 'fair' level.",

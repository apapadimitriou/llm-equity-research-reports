    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all essential sections, including a detailed Analyst Note, Business Strategy, Economic Moat, and Risk analysis. It provides a clear link between operating drivers\u2014specifically 6% iPhone revenue growth, 10% Services growth, and gross margin expansion to 49%\u2014and the $200 fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is robust, comparing Apple against Alphabet, Microsoft, and Samsung across multiple valuation multiples. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' because the 'Financials Snapshot' (Valuation Model Summary) is generic. While sector-specific KPIs like iPhone and Services revenue growth are discussed qualitatively and quantitatively within the text of the Valuation section, they are absent from the formal multi-year financial tables, which only provide consolidated line items. Per the grading instructions, the omission of at least two core sector KPIs from the Financials Snapshot necessitates a 'Fair' grade. Furthermore, while the report mentions scenario-based risks such as tariff impacts in the Analyst Note archive, it lacks a dedicated quantitative scenario analysis section or table (e.g., Bull/Bear case valuations) which is required for a higher grade. The evidence integration is consistent, with claims tied to specific corporate events like WWDC 2025 and the iPhone 16e launch, but the structural deficiency in the data presentation and the lack of formal sensitivity modeling limit the overall comprehensiveness score.",

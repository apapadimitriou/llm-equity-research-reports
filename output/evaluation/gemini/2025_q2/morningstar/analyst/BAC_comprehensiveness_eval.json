    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates exhaustive coverage across all required content areas, earning an 'Excellent' grade. It begins with a clear executive summary and a detailed business description. The 'Economic Moat' section is particularly robust, providing a deep dive into the bank's cost advantages, switching costs, and scale/scope, supported by quantitative data such as deposit costs (0.64% vs 4.33% Fed funds rate) and market share. Sector-specific KPIs are pervasive; the Financials Snapshot and Valuation sections explicitly track Net Interest Margin (NIM), Net Interest Income (NII), Efficiency Ratio, and Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), providing both historical context and five-year forecasts. Valuation is clearly bridged from operating drivers, specifically linking the fair value increase to NII equilibrium and the repricing of the securities book. Peer benchmarking is integrated throughout, with a dedicated comparison table against JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, alongside relative valuation multiples (P/E, P/B, P/S). Evidence integration is high, with claims regarding capital requirements and stress test results tied to specific regulatory events like the Fed stress tests. Redundancy is minimal, as Analyst Notes provide timely updates on tariffs and election impacts that complement the core strategy. Finally, scenario analysis is present through the evaluation of a 'bear-case' tariff environment and the impact of Fed stress scenarios on capital buffers, fulfilling the criteria for the highest grade.",

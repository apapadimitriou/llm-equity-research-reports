    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all mandatory qualitative sections, including a robust discussion of the economic moat, competitive positioning, and capital allocation. Peer benchmarking is a significant strength, featuring a dedicated comparison table and ESG-specific peer analysis. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to several critical omissions and structural issues. First, the Financials Snapshot table is generic and fails the 'Hard Cap' for sector-specific KPIs. For a Medical Device company, core metrics such as R&D expenditure (crucial for assessing the innovation-led moat), a breakdown of revenue by segment (e.g., Cardiovascular vs. MedSurg), and organic vs. inorganic growth rates are missing from the data tables. While some of these figures are mentioned sporadically in the text, their absence in the multi-year forecast table limits the report's utility. Second, the report exhibits significant redundancy; the 'Analyst Notes Archive' repeats the same core thesis regarding Farapulse and Watchman across five chronological entries, occupying nearly 25% of the report without providing new depth in the main strategy section. Finally, the report lacks a formal scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., a bull/bear valuation table or WACC sensitivity grid), which is a requirement for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. These gaps result in a report that feels more like a collection of historical notes than a forward-looking, comprehensive valuation model.",

    "reasoning": "The report is generally well-written with a clear logical progression from recent news to long-term valuation. The analyst note from June 16, 2025, effectively integrates the WhatsApp ad announcement into the existing thesis, maintaining the $770 fair value estimate (FVE) while explaining the strategic rationale. The 'Economic Moat' section provides high-quality analysis, particularly in its balanced view of AI\u2014praising ad-targeting improvements while remaining skeptical of unmonetized generative AI chatbots. However, the report suffers from significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the supporting financial tables, triggering a mandatory cap at 'fair.' The most glaring issue is the FVE history. The Analyst Note from January 30, 2025, explicitly states the FVE was raised 'to $770 from $590.' Yet, the 'Forecast Revisions' table on page 16 lists the 'Prior data as of 29 Jan 2025' as $771.16. This $771.16 figure is never mentioned in the text and directly contradicts the $590 figure cited in the January 22 and January 30 notes. Furthermore, there is a misalignment in margin projections. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (page 6) forecasts operating margins 'rising to 43%,' but the 'Valuation Model Summary' (page 15) shows a 2029 forecast of 42.5% and a five-year average of 41.6%. While the narrative is cohesive, these quantitative discrepancies between the text and the data tables undermine the report's overall reliability.",

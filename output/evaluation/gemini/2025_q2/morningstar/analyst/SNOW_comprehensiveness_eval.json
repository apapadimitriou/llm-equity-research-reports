    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all required sections from the executive summary to a detailed ESG assessment and financial history. It excels in sector-specific KPI integration, explicitly discussing Net Revenue Retention (NRR), Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), and Product Revenue, which are critical for a consumption-based SaaS model like Snowflake. The valuation section provides a clear bridge from operating drivers (revenue CAGR, margin expansion) to the fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is robust, appearing in both the valuation comparison and the ESG risk assessment. However, the report stops short of 'Excellent' due to the absence of a quantitative scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., a table showing valuation sensitivity to WACC or terminal growth rates). While the 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section provides qualitative upside/downside drivers, it does not substitute for the quantitative modeling expected for the highest grade. Redundancy is minimal, though the inclusion of a lengthy 'Analyst Notes Archive' adds bulk without providing new forward-looking depth. The evidence integration is strong, with claims in the analyst note directly supported by the multi-year financial tables and the forward-looking estimates provided in the summary tables.",

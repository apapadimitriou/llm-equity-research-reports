    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple material numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, indicating a failure in internal consistency and data integrity. While the analyst is explicit in stating key drivers\u2014such as segment-level revenue growth (iPhone, Services, Wearables) and margin expansion targets\u2014the figures provided in the text frequently conflict with the report's own valuation model. Specifically, the narrative projects a 7% revenue CAGR through 2029, while the table calculates a 6.0% CAGR. Furthermore, the narrative cites a 2024 operating margin of 32% and a 2029 target of 35%, but the financial table lists 29.8% and 34.0% respectively. Compounding these issues, the table itself contains internal errors, where the 2024 operating margin row (29.8%) does not reconcile with the reported operating income and revenue figures (which imply 31.5%). Although the report offers solid specificity regarding units and time horizons and includes a well-justified qualitative thesis on Apple's ecosystem moat, these systemic numeric discrepancies make the model's outputs feel like a 'black box.' Finally, while the report quantifies a specific downside scenario for US tariffs (25% impact), it lacks standard sensitivity matrices for primary valuation levers like WACC or terminal growth, failing to meet the requirements for a higher grade.",

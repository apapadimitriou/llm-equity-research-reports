    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally comprehensive, including all required sections from the Analyst Note to the ESG assessment and Peer Benchmarking. It provides significant qualitative depth, particularly in the Economic Moat analysis and the Capital Allocation section. The valuation section is a highlight, as it explicitly links operating drivers\u2014such as AUM growth (forecasted at 4.4% for 2025-29) and fee compression\u2014to the final fair value estimate of $1,050. The inclusion of Bull and Bear case scenarios further enhances the depth of the valuation analysis. However, the report is subject to a 'Fair' grade cap due to the omission of core sector-specific KPIs within the Financials Snapshot table. While Assets Under Management (AUM), Net Flows, and Organic Growth rates are discussed extensively in the text, they are absent from the multi-year forecast table, which remains limited to generic accounting metrics. Additionally, there is notable redundancy between the Business Strategy and Economic Moat sections; both sections repeat the same narrative regarding secular headwinds and the industry-wide shift toward passive investing without providing distinct analytical layers. This repetition, combined with the KPI omission in the formal snapshot, prevents the report from achieving a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating despite its strong evidence integration and peer context.",

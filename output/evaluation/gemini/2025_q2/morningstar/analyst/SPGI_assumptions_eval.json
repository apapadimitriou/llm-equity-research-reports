    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates a high degree of explicitness and specificity regarding its core assumptions. Key drivers, including segment-level revenue growth (6% organic 5-year CAGR), margin expansion (targeting 52% adjusted operating margin by 2029), and pricing power (8.10 bps for corporate ratings), are clearly defined and proximal to the forecasts. Justification is solid, leveraging multi-year historical pricing trends dating back to 2007 and macroeconomic correlations such as nominal GDP growth. Internal consistency is maintained between the narrative and the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table; figures for WACC (7.3%), tax rates (21%), and share count reductions (312M to 282M) reconcile across the document. However, the report fails to meet the criteria for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' grade due to the absence of quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis. While the 'Risk and Uncertainty' section qualitatively discusses the impact of interest rates and bond issuance volatility, it does not provide quantified ranges or a sensitivity matrix showing how changes in these material drivers would impact the Fair Value Estimate. Per the grading instructions, the lack of quantified sensitivities on material drivers necessitates a 'Fair' grade cap.",

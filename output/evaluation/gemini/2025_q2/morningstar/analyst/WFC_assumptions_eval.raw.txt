  "grade": "Poor",
  "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded \"Poor\" due to multiple significant numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, alongside a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst explicitly states key assumptions—such as a 2.70% Net Interest Margin (NIM) for 2025 and a terminal efficiency ratio of 61%—these figures are internally inconsistent with the \"Morningstar Valuation Model Summary.\" Specifically, the text forecasts 1% Net Interest Income (NII) growth for 2025, whereas the summary table on page 21 shows a 9.0% decline. Furthermore, the text cites a 2024 NIM of 2.74%, while the table records it as 3.1%. A third discrepancy exists regarding the terminal Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), cited as 14.3% in the text but 15.1% in the 2029 forecast table. These discrepancies make the model's outputs feel like a \"black box\" and prevent a clear audit of the valuation. Justification for assumptions is otherwise solid, drawing on the bank's multi-year regulatory rebuild and the 2018 asset cap history. Specificity is also high, with clear units and time horizons for interest rate paths and mid-cycle returns. However, the report fails to provide quantified stress tests or scenario ranges for material drivers like interest rates or credit costs, which is a critical omission for an asset-sensitive institution. Per the hard caps, the presence of multiple distinct contradictions combined with the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a \"Poor\" rating.",

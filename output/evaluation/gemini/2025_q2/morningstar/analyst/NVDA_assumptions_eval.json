    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are highly explicit and specific, particularly regarding the impact of the US regulatory reversal on H20 GPU sales to China. The analyst provides clear magnitudes for revenue re-insertion ($5 billion near-term, $30 billion long-term) and detailed segment-level forecasts for Data Center, Gaming, and Automotive through FY2028. Justification is solid, leveraging historical growth benchmarks (114%-126% revenue growth in recent years) and specific policy catalysts. Internal consistency is high, with the narrative's segment growth rates and margin targets reconciling with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' and 'Forecast Revisions' tables.\n\nHowever, the report is limited by a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While it assigns a 'Very High' Uncertainty Rating and qualitatively discusses risks such as competition from hyperscalers' in-house chips and geopolitical volatility, it does not provide quantified scenarios or a sensitivity matrix showing how changes in key drivers (e.g., AI capital expenditure levels or gross margin compression) would impact the $170 Fair Value Estimate. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers restricts the grade to 'Fair,' despite the otherwise high quality of explicitness and justification.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high comprehensiveness, covering all core sections required for a biopharma equity research report. It provides a detailed Business Description, Strategy, and a robust Economic Moat analysis centered on intangible assets and cost advantages. The sector-specific KPIs are a significant strength; the analyst includes explicit peak sales estimates for multiple drugs (Repatha, Tezspire, Tepezza, Maritide), specific patent expiration timelines (2025 for Prolia/Xgeva, 2028 for Enbrel), and clinical trial data (vomiting rates and weight loss percentages for Maritide). The valuation section is clearly linked to operating drivers, specifically citing a 60% probability of approval for Maritide and adjustments for the Inflation Reduction Act. Peer benchmarking is present, comparing Amgen to Novartis and Regeneron on both financial multiples and ESG risk ratings. Evidence integration is consistent, with claims tied to specific trial results or regulatory dates. The report is prevented from reaching an 'Excellent' grade due to two factors: first, it lacks a formal, tabular scenario or sensitivity analysis (e.g., a table showing Fair Value Estimate sensitivity to WACC or terminal growth changes), although qualitative scenarios are discussed. Second, there is minor superficial redundancy; peak sales figures for the core portfolio are repeated almost verbatim between the 'Business Strategy' and 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' sections without significant additional depth in the latter, which triggers a one-level downgrade from the highest possible tier per the instruction rules.",

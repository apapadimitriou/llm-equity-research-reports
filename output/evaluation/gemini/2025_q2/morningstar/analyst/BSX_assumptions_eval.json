    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for Boston Scientific, particularly regarding revenue drivers like Farapulse and Watchman. Revenue growth is projected at an 11% CAGR through 2029, supported by detailed narrative on product adoption and recent acquisitions such as Axonics and Silk Road Medical. Justification is generally solid, relying on clinical data (ADVENT trial) and management guidance. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to two primary issues. First, there is a clear internal contradiction regarding the terminal operating margin: the narrative forecasts a peak of 27% in 2029, while the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table explicitly lists the 2029 operating margin as 25.8%. Second, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for its material drivers (e.g., the valuation impact of PFA competition or tariff offsets). While the methodology section mentions that analysts use scenario analysis to augment the process, no such quantified ranges or bull/bear cases are presented in the report body. These deficiencies\u2014a numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified stress-testing\u2014trigger hard caps in the evaluation framework, limiting the final grade to Fair despite the high quality of the qualitative justifications.",

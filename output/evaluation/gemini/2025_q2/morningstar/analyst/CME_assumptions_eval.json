    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple distinct numeric contradictions and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst provides explicit and specific assumptions regarding revenue growth (3% CAGR), transactional revenue (2.5%), and operating expenses ($1.65B for 2025), these are undermined by significant internal inconsistencies. Specifically, the narrative forecasts an operating margin of 63.2% by 2028, whereas the summary valuation table lists 64.2% for the same period. More egregiously, the 'Margins & Returns' table contains nonsensical averages; it claims a 3-year average operating margin of 75.6% despite annual figures ranging from 60.1% to 64.1%, and a 5-year average EBITDA margin of 8.8% against forecasts exceeding 81%. Furthermore, the report fails the sensitivity requirement. Although it identifies risks such as interest rate normalization and new competition (FMX), it offers no quantified scenarios or sensitivity tables showing how changes in trading volume or rates would impact the fair value estimate. The valuation relies on a 'black-box' DCF where the Stage II and III parameters are stated but not stress-tested. These unresolved contradictions and the lack of quantified risk modeling violate the core requirements for a higher grade, triggering the hard cap for Poor.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "AbbVie\u2019s assumptions are graded Good due to their high degree of explicitness and strong justification using both historical performance and management guidance. Key revenue drivers, such as the $31 billion 2027 sales target for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are clearly stated and proximal to the valuation narrative. The report provides specific magnitudes for top-line growth (5% CAGR), tax rates (19%), and capital costs (7.5% COE). Internal consistency is solid; while GAAP operating margins show expansion, the analyst\u2019s claim of 'stable margins' reconciles with the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Margin forecasts in the summary table. Justification is evidence-rich, citing specific growth rates (e.g., 51% for Skyrizi) and competitive dynamics (Humira biosimilars). Sensitivity analysis is present through quantified 'worst-case' scenarios regarding US drug pricing policy (24% hit to US drug revenue) and potential pharmaceutical tariffs (2-percentage-point operating margin headwind). However, the report stops short of an Excellent grade because it lacks a comprehensive sensitivity matrix or bull/bear valuation table that maps these scenarios directly to changes in the $184 Fair Value Estimate for all material levers.",

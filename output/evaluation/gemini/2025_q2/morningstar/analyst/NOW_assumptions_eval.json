    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers. Key inputs, such as the 18% five-year revenue CAGR and the expansion of non-GAAP operating margins to the 'mid-30% area,' are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts. These assumptions are well-justified through a combination of historical performance (e.g., 2024 actuals), management's 2026 financial targets, and specific causal drivers like 'Pro Plus' generative AI adoption and 'land-and-expand' sales strategies. Internal consistency is a strength; the narrative's 18% growth target reconciles precisely with the 17.9% CAGR calculated from the provided 2024-2029 financial table. However, the report is subject to a hard cap of 'Fair' because it lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges (e.g., Bull/Bear cases) within the text. While the methodology section claims scenario analysis is used to determine star ratings and mentions that additional scenarios are available for download, the report itself does not provide quantified impacts of changes in material drivers like WACC, terminal growth, or subscription deceleration on the $1,050 fair value estimate.",

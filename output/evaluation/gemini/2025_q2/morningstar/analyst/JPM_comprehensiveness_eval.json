    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is exceptionally comprehensive, covering all required sections from the executive summary to a detailed ESG breakdown and multi-year financial forecasts. It provides deep sector-specific analysis for a diversified bank, utilizing critical KPIs such as Net Interest Margin (NIM), Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), and Efficiency Ratios. The 'Economic Moat' section is particularly robust, offering granular data on market share (e.g., 11.3% of US retail deposits) and citing reputable third-party sources like Dealogic, FDIC, and Coalition Greenwich. Valuation is clearly linked to operating drivers, specifically citing how a midcycle ROTE of 18.5% and NIM of 2.61% support the $235 fair value estimate. Peer benchmarking is integrated via a dedicated competitor comparison table and ESG peer analysis. While it lacks a standalone 'Scenario Analysis' table, the inclusion of 1-star and 5-star price targets (representing the margin of safety/sensitivity) and a detailed 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section fulfills the requirement for addressing alternative outcomes. The report maintains high evidence standards with consistent in-text citations and minimal superficial redundancy. The inclusion of an Analyst Notes Archive provides additional context on recent regulatory and technological shifts, further enhancing the depth of the research.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, compounded by a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst explicitly states key assumptions\u2014such as a 4% five-year revenue CAGR and 40 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion\u2014these figures fail to reconcile with the provided valuation model. Specifically, the model table reports a 4.3% five-year revenue CAGR, and the projected margin expansion from 2024 (40.2%) to 2029 (42.0%) averages only 36 basis points per year. These discrepancies undermine the internal consistency and auditability of the report. Furthermore, although the report identifies material risks including banking sector volatility and technological disruption, it offers no quantified scenarios or sensitivity ranges to demonstrate how changes in these drivers would impact the $88 fair value estimate. Justification for inputs is primarily qualitative, relying on the company's strategic pivot toward stable bank technology, but lacks robust multi-year historical or peer benchmarking to support the specific magnitudes chosen. While the report is transparent about its terminal growth (4%) and cost of equity (7.5%) inputs, the failure to maintain internal coherence and provide stress-testing for material levers triggers the hard caps for a Poor rating.",

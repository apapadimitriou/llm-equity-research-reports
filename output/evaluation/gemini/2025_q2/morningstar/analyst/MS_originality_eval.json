    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is a hybrid of high-value quantitative synthesis and standard industry boilerplate. On the positive side, the analyst provides a sophisticated synthesis of the Federal Reserve's stress test results, specifically calculating a 40-65 basis point decline in Morgan Stanley's stress capital buffer and estimating that the bank holds excess capital equivalent to 5% of its market capitalization. Furthermore, the report adds value by integrating third-party data from Cerulli and McKinsey to quantify the 'moat' in wealth management, citing specific advisor retention rates and asset loss percentages (30%) during transitions. These elements provide decision-relevant, company-specific angles. However, the majority of the report's thematic content is composed of generic restatements. The central thesis regarding the 'shift to wealth management' for stability is a decade-old narrative, and the discussions on Basel III RWA inflation (20%) and trading revenue 'mean reversion' are standard sector-wide headlines found in most peer research. The valuation section relies on a standard DCF model with conventional drivers like AUM growth and NII normalization, lacking any novel mechanical link or unique macro-to-margin trajectory. Because the report contains at least three major insights that are generic restatements or sector-wide boilerplate (Wealth Management shift, Basel III impact, and Trading normalization), the grading criteria mandate a 'Fair' rating, overriding the higher-quality syntheses found in the analyst notes.",

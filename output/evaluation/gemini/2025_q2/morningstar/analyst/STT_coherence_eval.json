    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong narrative flow and excellent integration of recent events (the June 2025 stress tests) with the long-term investment thesis. The Analyst Notes provide clear 'Why it matters' and 'Bottom line' summaries that bridge macro developments to the specific impact on State Street's capital return potential. However, a significant internal contradiction exists within the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on Page 13. The 'Net Interest Income Growth %' row lists 33.5% for 2023 and 8.5% for 2024, which mathematically contradicts the raw 'Net Interest Income (USD Mil)' figures provided in the same table (2,759 and 2,923 respectively). The narrative in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section correctly identifies the growth as 8% and 6%, aligning with the raw dollar amounts but leaving the table's growth percentages as unresolved errors. Additionally, while the Bulls/Bears are well-reconciled in the valuation narrative, the discrepancy in the financial table is a material oversight in data consistency. The report remains understandable, but the lack of alignment between the table's summary ratios and its underlying data necessitates a downgrade to 'fair' per the instruction's guardrails. The temporal alignment is otherwise excellent, with the June 29 note correctly referencing the June 27 Fed results.",

        "Narrative states 'NII... rose 8% in 2023 and 6% in 2024' (Page 5) while the Valuation Model Summary table (Page 13) lists growth at 33.5% and 8.5% for those years.",
        "The Analyst Note (Page 1) provides a clear connection between the Fed's 'severely adverse scenario' and the 'stress capital buffer,' explaining the impact on shareholder returns.",
        "The 'Economic Moat' section (Page 4) uses the BlackRock custodian switch to prove switching costs, noting the 'transition took several years' (2020-2025)."

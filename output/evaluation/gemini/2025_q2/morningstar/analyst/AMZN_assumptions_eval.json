    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions for its base-case valuation, particularly regarding revenue segments and margin expansion. Key drivers are clearly broken down: retail-related revenue (8% CAGR), AWS (16% CAGR), and advertising (17% CAGR) over a five-year horizon. These figures are internally consistent, reconciling perfectly with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table, where the 2029 operating margin of 12.7% aligns with the narrative's 'approximately 13%' target. Justification is solid, linking forecasts to secular e-commerce trends, cloud capacity constraints, and historical margin improvements from network optimization. However, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to the lack of robust, quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for material operating drivers. While the analyst mentions that a 100-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase the fair value estimate by 20%, there are no quantified bull/bear ranges for the primary drivers (AWS growth or retail margins). Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified scenarios for material drivers necessitates a 'Fair' grade, as the outputs remain somewhat 'black-box' regarding how variance in growth or margins would impact the $240 valuation.",

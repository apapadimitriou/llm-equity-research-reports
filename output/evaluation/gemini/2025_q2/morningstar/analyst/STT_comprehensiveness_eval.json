    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report covers all required sections, including a robust Economic Moat analysis and a detailed ESG Risk Rating Assessment. However, it is held back by significant omissions in the Financials Snapshot and repetitive content. Specifically, the multi-year financial table lacks critical sector-specific volume KPIs such as Assets under Custody/Administration (AUC/A) and Assets under Management (AUM), as well as regulatory capital ratios like Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), although these figures are mentioned sporadically in the text. The valuation section provides a DCF summary but lacks a clear, explicit bridge linking specific operating drivers\u2014such as the cited fee compression percentages\u2014to the final fair value outcome. Furthermore, the report exhibits notable redundancy; the loss of ETF market share and the strategic impact of the Charles River acquisition are repeated across four different sections (Strategy, Moat, Risk, and Capital Allocation) without adding significant new depth in each instance. While the peer benchmarking and ESG sections are comprehensive, the failure to integrate core sector KPIs into the formal financial projections and the high level of superficial repetition trigger hard caps and downgrades, resulting in a 'Fair' grade.",

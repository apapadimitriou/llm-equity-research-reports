    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for revenue growth (9% net CAGR), operating margins (70 bps annual improvement), and valuation inputs (9% COE, 21% tax rate). These are well-integrated between the narrative and the detailed financial tables. Justification is provided through qualitative discussion of secular shifts to digital payments and business scalability, supported by historical performance data. However, the report fails to provide any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling (e.g., Bull/Bear cases) for its material drivers. While the methodology section claims such analysis is used, no specific ranges or impacts on the Fair Value Estimate are presented in this document. Per the grading instructions, the absence of quantified stress-testing for material drivers necessitates a cap at 'Fair.' The internal consistency is high, with figures in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section reconciling perfectly with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' and 'Key Valuation Drivers' tables. Specificity is also strong, with clear time horizons (5-year explicit forecast) and units (CAGR, basis points). However, without quantified ranges for the most sensitive levers\u2014such as cross-border volume growth or regulatory impact on fees\u2014the assumptions remain a 'black box' regarding their impact on the final valuation.",

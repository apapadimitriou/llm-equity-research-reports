    "grade": "poor",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded \"poor\" due to significant, unresolved contradictions between the narrative analysis and the quantitative data tables, compounded by a failure to reconcile the Bull/Bear cases with the valuation. Most critically, the Economic Moat and Fair Value sections forecast a \"moatworthy\" efficiency ratio of 58% and a normalized return on tangible common equity (ROTE) of 16.5%-17%. However, the \"Morningstar Valuation Model Summary\" (Page 15) explicitly contradicts these assumptions; the efficiency ratio never improves beyond 60.4% and actually degrades to 62.2% by 2029, while the ROTE peaks at only 13.9%. This creates a fundamental disconnect in the investment thesis. Additionally, the \"Bulls Say\" section claims that valuations are \"not demanding... for PNC specifically,\" which is irreconcilable with the report's own data showing the stock trading at a premium to its $181 Fair Value Estimate (1.03 P/FVE) and the lead Analyst Note's warning of \"overvaluation\" in the sector. While the report's prose is clear and the structural flow between sections is logical, the data integrity is compromised. The reader is left to resolve whether the analyst's optimistic narrative or the more conservative model outputs represent the true base case. These systemic misalignments between text and tables fail the basic requirements for internal coherence and structural consistency.",

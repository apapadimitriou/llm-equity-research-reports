    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report provides a cohesive narrative regarding Biogen\u2019s transition from its legacy multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise to a future centered on Alzheimer\u2019s (Leqembi) and rare diseases (Skyclarys). The analyst effectively links the Narrow Moat rating to the erosion of MS pricing power and the slow ramp of new therapies. Cross-references between the Analyst Notes and the Fair Value sections are strong, particularly the February 2025 update that lowered the Fair Value Estimate from $303 to $220 based on a more cautious Leqembi peak sales forecast (reduced from $6B to $3B).\n\nHowever, the report suffers from two material internal contradictions that trigger a fair cap. First, the Economic Moat narrative predicts that ROIC will exceed the 7.1% cost of capital by 2026. This is directly refuted by the Morningstar Valuation Model Summary table, which forecasts ROIC at only 5.7% in 2026, not reaching the 7.1% threshold until 2029. Second, there is a lack of alignment regarding Spinraza\u2019s outlook; the Business Strategy section anticipates sales remaining around $2 billion, while the Fair Value and Profit Drivers section expects stabilization at $1.5 billion. These discrepancies between the narrative assumptions and the financial modeling data create significant internal noise. While the Bulls/Bears are well-integrated and the Analyst Notes provide timely updates on political and regulatory risks, the quantitative-to-qualitative misalignment necessitates a downgrade.",
    "evidence": [
        "\"expect ROICs to exceed our 7.1% cost of capital estimate once again by 2026\" (Economic Moat) vs. Table showing 5.7% in 2026 and 7.7% in 2029.",
        "\"sales of Spinraza... will remain around $2 billion\" (Business Strategy) vs. \"expect sales to stabilize at around $1.5 billion\" (Fair Value and Profit Drivers).",
        "Analyst Note (13 Feb 2025) explicitly reconciles the FVE drop from $303 to $220 with the halved peak sales forecast for Leqembi."

    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses and a clear original thesis regarding the strategic rationale for the diabetes spinoff. Specifically, the analyst provides a unique biological and technical explanation for switching costs, linking the physical integration of implanted leads (tissue growth) to the necessity of brand-consistent generator replacement. The report also offers a non-obvious strategic insight into the diabetes spinoff, framing it as a solution to internal capital competition where the unit struggled to secure resources against high-priority projects like TAVR and renal denervation. Furthermore, the analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation market provides a specific competitive roadmap, predicting a market share shift by Medtronic and Boston Scientific against long-standing incumbents J&J and Abbott. Financial forecasts are well-supported by specific drivers; the analyst quantifies the margin drag of new launches (50 bps) and links the 4% revenue growth target to specific, named product cycles and reimbursement catalysts, such as the Medicare transitional pass-through payment for renal denervation. This level of company-specific mechanism and quantified pathway exceeds the requirements for a 'Good' rating.",

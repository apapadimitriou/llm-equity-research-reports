    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses and a specific, testable thesis regarding the Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) market. The analyst moves beyond simple earnings recaps by identifying a critical competitive shift: Boston Scientific is not just gaining share in ablation, but is actively threatening the mapping and navigation 'strongholds' of incumbents Abbott and Johnson & Johnson through the integration of its Faraview software and Farawave catheters. This 'two-in-one' mechanism is a sophisticated synthesis of product technology and competitive strategy. Furthermore, the report provides an original thesis predicting that PFA will capture over 90% of the ablation market, a bold claim supported by clinical safety and efficiency observations. The analysis of the China tariff impact is also highly specific, quantifying a $200 million headwind and identifying the exact mechanisms (FX and cost-cutting) management will use to neutralize it. Unlike generic reports that cite 'innovation' as a driver, this report details the physical switching costs in the CRM business\u2014specifically the tissue enmeshment of leads\u2014and provides clear catalysts, such as the Option and Champion trials for Watchman. The valuation is directly tied to these novel drivers, specifically the accelerated adoption of Farapulse. The depth of peer-specific detail, such as J&J\u2019s Varipulse launch pause, further elevates the report's value-add.",

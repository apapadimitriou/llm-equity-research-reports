    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is structurally complete, containing all required sections from a Business Description to a detailed Economic Moat analysis and ESG assessment. It provides a clear investment thesis centered on Amazon's leadership in e-commerce and cloud services (AWS). However, the report is capped at a 'Fair' grade due to several specific omissions and redundancies. Most significantly, the Financials Snapshot (Page 15) is generic; it provides consolidated figures but omits multi-year forecasts for core sector-specific KPIs such as AWS revenue, Advertising revenue, and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), which are the primary drivers of the valuation. While growth rates for these segments are mentioned qualitatively in the text, their absence from the formal financial tables limits the transparency of the valuation bridge. Furthermore, the report lacks a dedicated scenario or sensitivity analysis table (e.g., a Bull/Bear case or WACC sensitivity matrix), which is expected for a 'Good' or 'Excellent' rating. There is also notable redundancy within the Economic Moat section, where the same competitive advantages (network effects, cost advantages) are listed and described multiple times across pages 2 through 6 without adding significant new depth. Finally, several material claims regarding employee counts and wage increases are presented without explicit citations or source references, further supporting the 'Fair' designation.",

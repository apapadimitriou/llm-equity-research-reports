    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits high structural coherence, featuring a logical progression from competitive positioning (Economic Moat) to financial forecasting and risk assessment. Transitions between sections are generally smooth, with consistent references to the 2022 IHS Markit acquisition and the 2026 Mobility spinoff across the Strategy, Moat, and Analyst Note sections. The narrative successfully reconciles the 'Bulls Say' and 'Bears Say' points by addressing ratings volatility within the broader context of GDP-linked growth and pricing power. Temporal claims are precise, with dates for CEO transitions, regulatory pricing updates, and spinoff announcements aligning perfectly with the July 2025 report date.\n\nHowever, a material internal contradiction exists between the narrative and the financial tables regarding margin assumptions. The 'Business Strategy & Outlook' section (Page 2) states that the adjusted operating margin was 49% in 2024 and is expected to reach 52% by 2029. Conversely, the 'Valuation Model Summary' table (Page 13) reports an 'Adjusted EBITDA Margin %' of 47.7% for 2024 and a forecast of 52.2% for 2029. Because EBITDA margins are mathematically required to be higher than or equal to operating margins (as they exclude depreciation and amortization), the narrative's claim of a 49% operating margin against a 47.7% EBITDA margin for the same period is an unresolved contradiction. Per the grading guardrails, this discrepancy necessitates a hard cap at the 'fair' level.",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative (Page 2) cites a 2024 adjusted operating margin of 49%, which contradicts the Valuation Model Summary (Page 13) showing a lower Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 47.7% for the same period.",
        "Excellent cross-referencing of the 2026 Mobility spinoff across the Business Strategy (Page 1), Economic Moat (Page 5), and Analyst Note (Page 7) sections.",
        "Temporal accuracy is maintained throughout, with the July 2025 report correctly positioning the April 2025 spinoff announcement and the 2024 CEO transition."

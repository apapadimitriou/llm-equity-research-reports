    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional coherence, seamlessly integrating a timely Analyst Note (June 29, 2025) with a comprehensive base-case update (June 10, 2025). The narrative arc is clear, moving from the immediate impact of favorable stress test results to a deep dive into the structural pivot toward Asset and Wealth Management (AWM). A primary strength is the explicit reconciliation between the 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section and the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' narrative. For instance, the Bear concern regarding a reset in trading revenue is directly addressed in the valuation assumptions, where the analyst models a 'proportionate drag from trading revenue' against a 'medium-term rebound in investment banking.' Furthermore, the report maintains perfect internal consistency between narrative claims and the provided financial tables. The text's projection of 'just north of 15 times leverage' by 2029 is mathematically supported by the 'Equity/Assets %' forecast of 6.6% in the Financials table. Similarly, the goal of reaching a 60% efficiency ratio by the end of the decade is reflected in the 2029 forecast of 60.2%. Terminology is used precisely, and the 'Economic Moat' section provides a sophisticated multi-layered argument for a 'Wide' rating, linking brand intangibles in banking to switching costs in UHNW wealth management. Temporal claims are accurate, correctly identifying the 2022-2023 period as a historical backdrop relative to the 2025 report date.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report reconciles the Bear case of trading revenue normalization with the base-case valuation, stating that forecasts 'expect a proportionate drag from trading revenue, which remains at peak cycle levels' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers, Page 8).",
        "Narrative leverage claims align with the financial table; the 'just north of 15 times leverage' projection (Page 9) matches the 6.6% Equity/Assets forecast for 2029 (Page 18).",
        "The 'Economic Moat' section (Page 4) provides explicit connective tissue, explaining how institutional trading 'attracts institutional investors to the Goldman Sachs ecosystem,' thereby supporting IPO distribution and asset management fund raising."

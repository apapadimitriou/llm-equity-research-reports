    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report's assumptions are rated Good due to high levels of explicitness, internal consistency, and quantified scenario analysis. Key drivers, including revenue growth (9% CAGR) and adjusted EPS growth (midteens), are clearly stated in the narrative and reconcile perfectly with the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. Justification is solid, leveraging management's Analyst Day targets and OIG estimates for regulatory clawbacks. Specificity is high, with the report providing exact magnitudes for the long-run tax rate (25%), WACC (8.2%), and terminal growth (4%). Consistency is a major strength; for instance, the $9 billion clawback mentioned in the text is explicitly modeled as a 2027 GAAP loss, reconciling the gap between reported and adjusted figures. Sensitivity analysis is present and quantified through a 'bull-case scenario' ($550 FVE vs. $323 base) and a discussion of the growth required to justify current market prices. While the report lacks a multi-variable sensitivity matrix, the quantification of the primary regulatory risk and the bull-case upside provides sufficient transparency for the 'Very High' uncertainty rating. The assumptions are proximal to the forecasts they drive, and the use of a multi-stage DCF model with explicit Stage II parameters (4% growth, 30% investment rate) ensures the valuation is auditable and traceable.",

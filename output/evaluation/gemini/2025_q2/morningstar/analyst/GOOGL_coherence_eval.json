    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates exceptional coherence, seamlessly integrating historical structural analysis with real-time updates. The narrative arc is clear, moving from the immediate impact of the Apple/Safari testimony (May 2025) to a deep dive into the structural advantages (Wide Moat) and long-term valuation drivers. A key strength is the perfect alignment between the narrative and the financial tables. For instance, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (Feb 2025) forecasts a 10% revenue CAGR and flat operating margins due to high capex; these are precisely reflected in the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table, which shows a 10.1% 5-year CAGR and operating margins hovering between 31% and 32.5% through 2029. Furthermore, the report proactively reconciles its base-case valuation ($237) with detailed bull ($266) and bear ($175) scenarios, specifically addressing the impact of antitrust remedies on revenue-sharing agreements. Temporal accuracy is maintained throughout; 'recent' events like the May 7 testimony and April 17 court opinion are correctly dated relative to the June 7, 2025, report date. The transition from the qualitative moat analysis to the quantitative valuation is logical and well-supported. Terminology is used consistently across all sections, and the Analyst Notes archive provides a clear chronological bridge between the older strategy sections and the current market environment, ensuring the reader does not have to assemble the argument themselves.",
    "evidence": [
        "The forecast of 'top line growing at an 10% compound annual growth rate over the next five years' (Fair Value and Profit Drivers) matches the 10.1% 5-year CAGR in the Valuation Model Summary (Page 19).",
        "The Analyst Note (8 May 2025) explicitly reconciles the 'recent' May 7 Apple testimony with the maintained $237 FVE, explaining why the market reaction is 'overblown.'",
        "The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section provides a clear bridge between the base case and the bear/bull cases ($175/$266), specifically citing the 20%-23% traffic acquisition costs."

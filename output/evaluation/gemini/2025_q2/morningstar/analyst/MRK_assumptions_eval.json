    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "Merck\u2019s valuation is primarily driven by the 'Keytruda cliff' in 2028 and Gardasil\u2019s performance in China. The report is highly explicit, providing specific peak sales estimates ($41B for Keytruda) and long-term targets ($7B for Gardasil by 2030). Assumptions are generally well-justified by citing patent expiration dates, clinical leadership in oncology, and macroeconomic headwinds in China. The report also provides clear valuation parameters like a 7.2% WACC and a 17% long-run tax rate.\n\nHowever, the report is capped at 'Fair' due to two critical issues. First, there is a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis for the most material drivers. While the analyst discusses risks qualitatively and provides a quantified impact for industry-wide tariffs (2-percentage-point margin headwind), there is no scenario modeling showing how variations in Keytruda\u2019s post-2028 erosion or Gardasil\u2019s recovery would affect the $111 Fair Value Estimate. Second, a numeric contradiction exists between the narrative and the model: the text assumes '1% sales growth in 2025,' whereas the valuation table forecasts 1.8% growth. Additionally, the 'close to 7%' top-line CAGR claim in the text slightly overstates the ~6% CAGR calculated from the provided financial tables. These inconsistencies, combined with the absence of robust valuation stress-testing, prevent a higher grade.",

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a logical structure and clear language, effectively connecting the recent Federal Reserve stress test results to the company's capital allocation strategy. The narrative flow is generally smooth, with the Analyst Note providing timely context for the current market price versus the fair value estimate. The 'Business Strategy & Outlook' and 'Economic Moat' sections provide a cohesive argument for the company's competitive positioning in the premium card market and its shift toward a younger demographic. However, the report contains material internal contradictions between the narrative and the provided financial tables. Specifically, the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section explicitly states that the operating margin is expected to be stable, ending 2029 at 22%, 'effectively unchanged from 2024.' In contrast, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table shows an operating margin (Operating Income divided by Total Pre-Provision Revenue) of approximately 19.5% for 2024 and 20.6% for 2029. Furthermore, the text cites a 26.1% CAGR for net interest income from 2021 to 2024, but the table reports 2024 annual growth at 32.7%, which creates a mathematical tension with the cited multi-year average. These unresolved discrepancies between the analyst's stated assumptions and the supporting data tables necessitate a 'fair' grade under the provided instructions.",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative claims a 22% operating margin for 2024 and 2029 (Fair Value and Profit Drivers), but the table calculates to 19.5% and 20.6% respectively (Valuation Model Summary).",
        "Text cites a 26.1% NII CAGR for 2021-2024 (Business Strategy & Outlook), while the table shows 2024 growth at 32.7% (Valuation Model Summary).",
        "The Analyst Note (29 Jun 2025) correctly identifies the stress test results from 'Friday, June 27' as a recent driver for the banking sector."

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple significant internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, compounded by a total lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. While the analyst is explicit in stating key assumptions\u2014such as a 7% NII growth for 2025, a 1.5% expense growth, and a normalized ROTE of 16.5-17%\u2014these figures are directly refuted by the report\u2019s own 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. Specifically, the table lists 2025 NII growth at -3.0% and expense growth at -3.5%, despite the absolute dollar values in the same table suggesting the opposite (6.97% and 1.35% growth, respectively). Furthermore, the projected ROTE in the table peaks at only 13.9% by 2029, failing to reconcile with the 16.5% 'normalized' level claimed in the text.\n\nJustification is a relative strength, as the analyst cites historical performance during the 2007 financial crisis and specific integration benefits from the BBVA acquisition to support credit and efficiency assumptions. Specificity is also high, with clear magnitudes and time horizons provided for most drivers. However, the report fails the sensitivity pillar; it relies on a qualitative 'Medium Uncertainty' rating without providing quantified ranges or scenario impacts for critical levers like interest rates or credit losses. Per the hard caps, the presence of more than two distinct numeric contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities mandate a 'Poor' grade.",

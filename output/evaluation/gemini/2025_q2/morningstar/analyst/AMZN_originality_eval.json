    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses and a sophisticated original thesis. It moves beyond standard e-commerce commentary by linking Amazon's shifting revenue mix (AWS and Advertising) to a specific, quantified margin expansion trajectory (GAAP operating margins moving from 11% to 13% by 2029). A standout original thesis is the 'commodification of complements' argument regarding AI; the analyst posits that the emergence of low-cost models like DeepSeek actually increases the value and usage of Amazon's primary cloud infrastructure, a non-obvious perspective that contrasts with generic 'AI competition' fears. Furthermore, the report provides company-specific operational insights, such as the 'multi-hub strategy' and the use of robotics as specific drivers for unlocking efficiencies. It also identifies clear catalysts and timing, such as the margin pressure from 'Project Kuiper' satellite launches and new AWS capacity coming online in 2025. The use of peer benchmarking\u2014specifically comparing Amazon's advertising margins to historical Facebook data to justify a 30%+ margin estimate\u2014adds a layer of interpretive analysis not found in public filings.",

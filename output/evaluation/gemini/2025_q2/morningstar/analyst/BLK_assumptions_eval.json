    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to multiple distinct numeric contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, as well as internal inconsistencies within the data tables. Most critically, the narrative cites a 2024 'adjusted operating margin' of 44.5%, which is mathematically inconsistent with the summary table\u2019s 'Adjusted EBITDA Margin' of 41.8% for the same period; operating margins cannot exceed EBITDA margins as the latter adds back depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the report contains a significant internal error in the 'Growth & Ratios' table, where the 3-year revenue CAGR is listed as -0.1% despite annual growth rates of 1.8%, -7.8%, and 14.3% implying a positive CAGR of approximately 2.4%.\n\nFurthermore, the report exhibits discrepancies in valuation parameters, stating a 21% US statutory tax rate in the text while utilizing a 21.7% long-run tax rate in the valuation model without reconciliation. While the report provides explicit assumptions for AUM growth and revenue, and includes robust quantified sensitivity analysis for bull and bear cases (specifying revenue CAGRs of 12.3% and 6.1% respectively), these fundamental numeric conflicts undermine the auditability and reliability of the model. Per the instruction's hard caps, two or more distinct contradictions necessitate a 'Poor' grade regardless of the quality of other sections.",

    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report earns an 'Excellent' grade due to the presence of three distinct, quantified syntheses that provide high decision relevance. First, the analyst synthesizes the threat of international price benchmarking by calculating a specific 24% hit to US drug revenue, which translates to a low-double-digit top-line impact for AbbVie based on its 50% US revenue exposure. This goes significantly beyond a generic restatement of policy risk. Second, the report provides a non-obvious perspective on the scope of potential price cuts, identifying Medicare drug spending in hospitals (10% of the market) as the likely target, thereby narrowing the perceived risk for investors. Third, the analyst quantifies the impact of potential 25% tariffs as a 2-percentage-point operating margin headwind, providing a clear mechanism for margin compression. While the report contains some boilerplate elements in the 'Economic Moat' and 'Business Strategy' sections\u2014specifically regarding the transition from Humira to Skyrizi/Rinvoq which mirrors company guidance\u2014the interpretive commentary on regulatory and macro catalysts is highly original. The valuation section incorporates these specific quantified drivers as risk scenarios, satisfying the requirement for a novel mechanism. The inclusion of monitoring signals (e.g., 12-week obesity data in 2026) and peer-specific pricing comparisons further supports the 'Excellent' rating.",

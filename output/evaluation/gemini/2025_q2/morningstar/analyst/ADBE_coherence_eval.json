    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits strong thematic coherence and a logical narrative arc, particularly in how the Analyst Note proactively addresses the 'Bear Say' regarding AI disruption. The analyst provides a clear quantitative bridge for the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) reduction from $590 to $560, citing a 30-basis-point reduction in growth assumptions. The 'Analyst Notes Archive' further enhances structural coherence by providing a transparent history of the valuation's evolution. However, the report suffers from a significant internal contradiction between the narrative and the provided financial tables. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section explicitly states that the analyst models non-GAAP operating margins to 'expand modestly on an annual basis.' In contrast, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 15 forecasts the Operating Margin % to drop from 34.3% in 2024 to 31.4% in 2025. Even the 'Adjusted Net Margin %'\u2014the closest proxy in the table\u2014shows a contraction from 38.5% to 37.5% in the 2025 forecast. This misalignment between the 'expansion' claim and the 'contraction' data in the immediate forecast year is an unaddressed tension. Furthermore, while the narrative relies heavily on non-GAAP operating margin figures (e.g., 45.5% in the Analyst Note), the main financial table lacks a specific row for this metric, making it difficult for the reader to verify the 'annual expansion' claim against the provided data. Per the instructions, this contradiction triggers a hard cap of 'fair.'",
    "evidence": [
        "Narrative claims margins will 'expand modestly on an annual basis' (Page 6) while the Valuation Model table shows Operating Margin % dropping from 34.3% in 2024 to 31.4% in 2025 (Page 15).",
        "The Analyst Note (Page 1) cites a Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 45.5%, but the primary financial table (Page 15) does not include a non-GAAP operating margin row to track this specific metric.",
        "The report successfully reconciles the Bear case regarding AI by noting that justifying the current price would require a 300-basis-point annual revenue hit, which the analyst deems 'not reasonable' (Analyst Note, Page 1)."

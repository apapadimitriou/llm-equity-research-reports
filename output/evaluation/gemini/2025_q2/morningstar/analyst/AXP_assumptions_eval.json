    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report\u2019s assumptions are explicitly stated and generally well-justified using historical data and peer comparisons. For instance, the analyst cites a 26.1% NII CAGR from 2021-2024 to support a forecasted deceleration to 7.2% through 2029. Specificity is also high, with clear magnitudes and time horizons provided for revenue drivers and expense ratios.\n\nHowever, the report fails to meet the minimum standards for consistency and sensitivity analysis, triggering a 'Poor' grade under the defined hard caps. Specifically, there are two distinct numeric contradictions. First, the narrative projects a 2029 operating margin of 22% (described as 'effectively unchanged' from 2024), yet the model's figures for 2024 and 2029 result in margins of 19.5% and 20.6%, respectively (calculated as Operating Income / Total Pre-Provision Revenue). Second, the narrative explicitly anticipates that lower capital requirements from stress tests will lead to share repurchases, yet the valuation table models a perfectly flat share count of 703 million from 2025 through 2029. Furthermore, the report provides no quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for its material drivers (e.g., interest rates or credit costs), offering only qualitative risk descriptions. Per the instruction's decision rules, the presence of multiple unresolved contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade, as these flaws undermine the auditability and internal coherence of the research.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and highly specific assumptions regarding Mastercard's growth and valuation. Key drivers such as the 12% revenue CAGR, the 9% cost of equity, and the 20% long-run tax rate are clearly stated and proximal to the valuation discussion. Justification is solid, leveraging the company's 'tollbooth' business model, global scalability, and the secular shift toward digital payments. However, the report fails to meet the 'Good' or 'Excellent' criteria due to two primary issues. First, there is a significant internal contradiction: the narrative explicitly forecasts operating margins (on a net revenue basis) to improve from 58% to 61% by 2029, equating to a 70-basis-point annual improvement. Conversely, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table shows a flat 'Operating Margin %' of 36.1% for both 2024 and 2029. While this might stem from a Gross vs. Net revenue distinction, the table's lack of margin expansion directly contradicts the narrative's core profitability thesis. Second, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers. While it qualitatively discusses risks like stablecoin adoption and regulatory pressure, it does not provide the required valuation impact ranges for changes in interest rates, volume growth, or margins. Per the grading instructions, the presence of a numeric contradiction and the absence of quantified sensitivities cap the grade at 'Fair'.",

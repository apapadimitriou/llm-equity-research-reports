    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'fair' grade due to several material internal contradictions between the narrative and the supporting data tables, which triggers a mandatory hard cap under the grading rubric. The most significant discrepancy involves profitability assumptions: the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section explicitly states the analyst models 'across-a-cycle operating margins of around 26%,' yet the Valuation Model Summary table forecasts efficiency ratios between 69.8% and 71.5% for the 2025\u20132029 period. Since the efficiency ratio is the inverse of the operating margin for banks, the table implies a much stronger ~30% margin, leaving a 400-basis-point gap unexplained. Additionally, there is a lack of continuity in the fair value history; the March 2025 update claims to lower the FVE to $101 from $107, but the January 2025 and November 2024 analyst notes both clearly establish the previous FVE as $106. Minor inconsistencies also appear in the share count, with the main table showing 1,611 million shares while the DCF summary uses 1,607 million. Despite these quantitative misalignments, the report demonstrates strong narrative coherence. The June 29 Analyst Note provides an excellent bridge between the recent Federal Reserve stress test results and the existing valuation, proactively warning that while the tests suggest excess capital, repurchasing shares at the current market premium would be value-destructive. The 'Economic Moat' and 'Business Strategy' sections are well-written and logically connected, but the numerical friction prevents a higher grade.",

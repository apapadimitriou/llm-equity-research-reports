    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report demonstrates a clear structural arc, moving from immediate catalysts (stress tests) to a deep dive into the bank's 'no-moat' competitive position and multi-year turnaround strategy. The language is professional, and the 'Economic Moat' section provides a thorough, segment-by-segment analysis that justifies the 'None' rating by comparing ROTE to the cost of capital. However, the report suffers from a significant internal contradiction regarding its primary profit driver, Net Interest Income (NII). In the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section, the analyst explicitly forecasts NII growth of 0.8% for 2025. Conversely, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table on page 19 presents a conflicting set of data: the raw NII figures ($54,095 million in 2024 to $55,458 million in 2025) calculate to a 2.5% increase, yet the 'Net Interest Income Growth %' row in that same table reports a -1.5% decline for 2025. This discrepancy between the narrative, the financial data, and the growth ratios creates a major break in coherence. While the temporal claims are accurate\u2014such as the June 29 note correctly referencing the June 27 stress tests\u2014and the 'Bulls/Bears' are generally reconciled with the valuation, the mathematical inconsistency in the financials table is an unaddressed tension that necessitates a 'fair' grade under the rubric's guardrails. The reader is left to guess which of the three conflicting NII growth figures is the intended base-case assumption.",

        "Narrative forecasts NII growth of 0.8% in 2025 (Fair Value and Profit Drivers, p. 10) while the Financials table reports -1.5% for the same period (p. 19).",
        "Financials table (p. 19) shows NII rising from $54,095M in 2024 to $55,458M in 2025, which is a ~2.5% increase, contradicting the -1.5% growth rate reported in the row below it.",
        "The Analyst Note (p. 1) accurately references the Federal Reserve's stress test results released on 'Friday, June 27' relative to the July 1, 2025, report date."

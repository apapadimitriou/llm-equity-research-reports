    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates exhaustive coverage across all required content areas, earning an 'Excellent' grade. It includes a timely Analyst Note focusing on the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, which serves as a sophisticated, sector-specific scenario analysis regarding capital drawdowns and stress capital buffers. The Business Strategy and Economic Moat sections are particularly robust, providing granular detail on segment-level competitive advantages (GBM and AWM) and citing specific market share data from Dealogic and growth estimates from BCG and Cerulli. The Financials Snapshot is comprehensive, featuring multi-year historical data and five-year forecasts for essential banking KPIs, including Net Interest Margin (NIM), Efficiency Ratio, CET1 ratio, and Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE). The valuation section provides an explicit link between operating drivers\u2014such as the 30% compensation ratio target and 14-16% ROE targets\u2014and the Fair Value Estimate (FVE) of $580. Peer benchmarking is integrated effectively, comparing Goldman Sachs against major rivals like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley across multiple valuation multiples and ESG risk metrics. Evidence integration is a significant strength; the analyst consistently ties material claims to external data sources and internal modeling assumptions. There is zero superficial repetition; each section adds new depth, such as the transition from the broad strategy pivot to the specific switching costs in the ultra-high-net-worth wealth management segment. The report feels complete, professional, and highly analytical.",

    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a highly transparent and auditable set of assumptions. Revenue drivers are broken down by segment (Search, YouTube, Cloud) with specific growth rates (6%, 10-12%, 26%) and clear causal justifications, such as AI query migration and cloud capacity constraints. Margins are explicitly modeled as flat (32%) due to the offset of efficiency gains by high AI-driven depreciation, a specific and logical causal link. Capital expenditure is quantified at $75 billion for 2025, aligning with management guidance. The report excels in sensitivity analysis, providing quantified Bull and Bear scenarios that adjust specific levers (Search growth, traffic acquisition costs) and provide clear target price impacts ($175 and $266). Furthermore, it includes event-specific sensitivities for tariffs and antitrust divestitures. Internal consistency is high, with narrative forecasts for margins and share counts reconciling with the detailed 5-year financial table. Justification is supported by historical R&D trends, market share data relative to peers (AWS/Azure), and legal/regulatory context. The use of a three-stage DCF model with explicit Stage II fade parameters (9% EBI growth) further enhances the auditability of the valuation. There are no unresolved numeric contradictions between the narrative and the extensive data tables, and the uncertainty rating is well-supported by the quantified range of outcomes.",

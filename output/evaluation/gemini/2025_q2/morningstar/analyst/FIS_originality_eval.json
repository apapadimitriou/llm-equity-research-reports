    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides several high-quality syntheses regarding FIS's strategic pivot following the Worldpay divestiture. The analyst moves beyond public headlines by contrasting FIS's operational failures in the merchant space with the relative success of peers like Fiserv and Global Payments, concluding that the issue was internal underinvestment in the SMB space rather than a fundamentally flawed merger strategy. This provides a company-specific angle on management execution. Furthermore, the report synthesizes the financial impact of the divestiture, identifying a 'cost deleveraging' effect caused by the reversal of previous synergies, which necessitates a specific cost-reduction plan to achieve the projected 40 basis point margin expansion. The analysis of the proposed Global Payments deal as a superior strategic fit for the core banking business (issuer processing vs. merchant acquiring) constitutes a decision-relevant thesis. While the valuation section relies on a standard DCF template, the report includes quantified drivers (4% revenue CAGR, 15.2x 2025 P/E) and identifies specific monitoring signals, such as the loss of transparency regarding the Worldpay minority stake turnaround.",

    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a competent summary of Snowflake's fiscal Q4 earnings and management's 2026 guidance, but it lacks the depth of original insight required for a higher grade. While the analyst offers two notable syntheses\u2014specifically identifying a 20% revenue growth threshold as the minimum requirement to justify the stock's premium valuation and presenting a cautious, slightly contrarian view on Snowflake's late entry into the generative AI space\u2014the majority of the content is restated from public filings. The competitive analysis regarding cloud-agnostic positioning versus hyperscalers (Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure) is standard industry knowledge. Furthermore, the valuation section relies on generic drivers, such as 'scale-based leverage' and 'TAM expansion,' without introducing a novel mechanism or company-specific unit economic driver. Because the report contains at least three insights that are generic restatements or standard DCF assumptions, and the valuation lacks a unique analytical angle, the grade is capped at Fair per the instruction's decision rules.",

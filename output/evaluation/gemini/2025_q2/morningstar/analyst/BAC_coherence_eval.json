    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits strong narrative flow and thematic consistency, particularly in the 'Economic Moat' and 'Business Strategy' sections, which effectively link the bank's scale and technology budget to its competitive positioning. The 'Bulls Say / Bears Say' sections are well-integrated, with the base-case valuation narrative proactively addressing bear concerns regarding interest-rate sensitivity and duration risk. However, the report suffers from significant quantitative contradictions that undermine its structural coherence. The 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table contains internal mathematical errors; for instance, it lists 2025 Net Interest Income (NII) growth as -1.5% despite the absolute figures ($56,060 million in 2024 and $60,521 million in 2025) reflecting a clear increase. This table data further conflicts with the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' narrative, which explicitly projects 2025 NII growth at 6.8%. Additionally, there is a minor temporal tension: the April 2025 Fair Value section describes an increase to $43.00 as a current action, whereas the report header indicates this value was established in February 2025. While the qualitative arguments are 'excellent' in depth and transition, the unresolved tensions between the narrative and the financial tables trigger a mandatory cap at 'fair.' The reader is left to reconcile three different versions of the 2025 NII outlook, which is a material flaw in an otherwise polished document.",

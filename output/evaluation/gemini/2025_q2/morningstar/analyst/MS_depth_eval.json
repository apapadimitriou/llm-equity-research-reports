    "grade": "Excellent",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates excellent analytical depth by providing a comprehensive causal framework for Morgan Stanley\u2019s valuation, supported by benchmarked data and multiple quantified scenarios. The analyst moves beyond description to explain that 'net interest income growing at a 8% compound annualized growth' rate and details how the wealth management shift drove margins that 'expanded to the mid- to upper-20s.' Assumptions are explicit and benchmarked, such as a 'cost of equity of 9% in our discounted cash flow' and comparing current ROE to historical averages. The report excels in its treatment of uncertainty and scenario analysis; it quantifies the impact of regulatory changes, noting that '$2 is from incorporating a 10% increase in regulatory capital' levels. Furthermore, it provides a 'midteens percentage fair value estimate decrease... in a bear-case scenario' for the sector regarding tariffs and estimates stress capital buffer declines of '40 basis points... or 65 basis points' depending on Fed policy. These quantified 'if-then' links between macro/regulatory drivers and valuation, combined with clear actionable implications regarding the stock's overvaluation, meet the criteria for the highest grade.",

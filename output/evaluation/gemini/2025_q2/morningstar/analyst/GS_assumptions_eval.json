    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded 'Poor' due to two distinct internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, alongside a lack of quantified sensitivity analysis. First, a direct numeric conflict exists regarding the Cost of Equity: the narrative explicitly states a 9.5% cost of equity is used in the valuation (Page 8), whereas the 'Key Valuation Drivers' table (Page 18) lists the input as 9.0%. Second, a fundamental logical contradiction occurs regarding capital allocation and share count. The report forecasts a high total payout ratio of 75% to 80% (Page 10) and explicitly mentions that excess capital will likely be returned through share repurchases (Page 1). However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' (Page 17) projects a perfectly flat weighted average diluted share count of 334 million from 2024 through 2029. This inconsistency indicates that the model's outputs are not internally coherent with the analyst's stated distribution assumptions. While the report provides explicit and well-justified assumptions for revenue growth (3.5% CAGR) and efficiency ratios (60% target) using historical and peer benchmarks, these strengths are undermined by the lack of quantified sensitivity testing. The report discusses risks qualitatively\u2014such as trade tensions and market volatility\u2014but fails to provide quantified impact ranges or scenario-based valuation targets for material drivers. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two distinct contradictions necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and proximal assumptions for Meta's valuation, primarily centered on a 12% five-year revenue CAGR and operating margins reaching 43%. These are well-justified through a combination of historical context (referencing the 2022 margin nadir) and specific causal drivers like ARPU growth in emerging markets and AI-driven ad efficiency. Specificity is high, with clear units, time horizons, and magnitudes provided in both the narrative and the detailed 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. Internal consistency is strong; the narrative's margin and growth targets reconcile closely with the multi-year forecast tables. Sensitivity analysis is a notable strength, moving beyond qualitative risk discussion to provide quantified valuation impacts for material external shocks. Specifically, the analyst quantifies a 15% fair value reduction in a persistent tariff scenario and a 20% increase in the event of a TikTok ban. While the report lacks a standard sensitivity matrix (e.g., WACC vs. Terminal Growth), the inclusion of these event-specific quantified scenarios and the explicit 'High' uncertainty rating parameters provides sufficient transparency into the model's levers to merit a 'Good' grade.",

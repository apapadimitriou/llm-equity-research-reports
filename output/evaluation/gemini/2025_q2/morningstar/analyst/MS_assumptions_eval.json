    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for revenue, AUM, and NII growth, often justified by historical performance or regulatory changes. However, it fails the consistency and sensitivity requirements. There are two distinct internal contradictions: first, the text models a 26% operating margin while the financial table's efficiency ratios imply a ~30% margin; second, the narrative emphasizes share repurchases as a primary capital return tool, yet the model assumes a static share count through 2029. Furthermore, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity or scenario analysis for material drivers specific to Morgan Stanley (e.g., market volatility or interest rate shifts), providing only a high-level sector bear case related to tariffs. Per the grading instructions, the combination of multiple contradictions and the absence of quantified sensitivities necessitates a 'Poor' grade. While the report is evidence-rich regarding the company's business strategy and historical moat sources, the disconnect between the narrative and the valuation model summary creates a 'black-box' feel for the final fair value estimate. The lack of stress-testing on key levers like the cost of equity or net interest margin further limits the auditability of the conclusions.",

    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates strong analytical depth through clear causal reasoning and explicit, quantified assumptions. The analyst explains the 'why' behind the fair value increase, citing 'more optimistic projections for Farapulse' and 'further growth of the Watchman' device. Causal mechanisms are well-defined, such as the explanation of switching costs where 'leads become enmeshed with tissue growth,' making substitution risky. The report uses data effectively, forecasting '11% average annual top-line growth through 2029' and identifying a specific '$200 million' headwind from tariffs. It benchmarks Boston Scientific against major peers like Medtronic and Abbott using valuation multiples (P/E, P/S) and ESG risk ratings. While the report identifies significant uncertainties, such as 'heightened competition' from Johnson & Johnson and potential 'device defects or product recalls,' it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or explicit bull/bear scenarios that would link these risks to specific changes in the fair value estimate. For instance, while it mentions tariffs will be offset by 'cost-cutting,' it does not provide a range of outcomes if those offsets fail. Consequently, while the reasoning is mechanism-rich and benchmarked, the absence of quantified scenario analysis limits the grade to 'Good.' Verbatim excerpts: 'driven primarily by the more optimistic projections for Farapulse'; 'margin gains pressured by tariffs'; 'leads become enmeshed with tissue growth'; '11% average annual top-line growth through 2029'; 'offset roughly half the tariff impact through... cost-cutting'.",

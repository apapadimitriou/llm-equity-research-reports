    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report is graded fair due to significant internal contradictions and temporal misalignments between the primary narrative sections and the Analyst Notes Archive. While the individual sections are written with clear language and logical internal flow, the report fails to function as a connected argument. A major contradiction exists regarding the Fair Value Estimate (FVE): the report header and 'Price vs. Fair Value' chart cite an FVE of $88.00 effective 18 Nov 2024, yet the Analyst Note from 4 Nov 2024 explicitly states the FVE was $83.00. The $88.00 valuation was not actually established until the 11 Feb 2025 note. Furthermore, the 'Business Strategy & Outlook' and 'Business Description' sections (dated Feb 2025) describe FIS as holding a minority stake in Worldpay. However, the 6 May 2025 Analyst Note discusses a 'proposed deal with Global Payments' to make a 'clean break' from that stake. Because the report is dated 24 Jun 2025, the failure to integrate this material May 2025 development into the main strategy and description sections creates a fragmented and contradictory reader experience. Additionally, the 'Forecast Revisions' table is only current as of Feb 2025, leaving the financial projections unaligned with the most recent analyst commentary. These unresolved tensions between the static narrative and the dynamic notes archive trigger the 'fair' hard cap for contradictions.",
    "evidence": [
        "The report header lists the $88.00 FVE date as 18 Nov 2024, but the 4 Nov 2024 Analyst Note states 'maintain our $83 fair value estimate' (Page 1 vs Page 7).",
        "The 6 May 2025 Analyst Note discusses a 'proposed deal with Global Payments' for a 'clean break with Worldpay,' which is not reflected in the Business Strategy section (Page 6 vs Page 1).",
        "The Business Description states FIS 'now has only a minority stake' in Worldpay, failing to reconcile with the May 2025 note regarding the potential divestiture of that interest (Page 2)."

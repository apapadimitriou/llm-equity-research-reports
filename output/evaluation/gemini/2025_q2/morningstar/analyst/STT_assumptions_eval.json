    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides a solid foundation of explicit and justified assumptions, particularly for near-term 2025 forecasts. Key drivers such as fee revenue growth (3%-5%), net interest income (roughly flat), and adjusted expense growth (2%-3%) are clearly stated and proximal to the financial tables. These inputs are well-justified through historical context, such as the multi-year tracking of pricing compression (2% in 2020-23 vs. 3% in 2024) and peer comparisons regarding net interest margins. Specificity is high, with clear units, time horizons, and causal drivers (e.g., market appreciation and FX volatility) identified for the servicing and management fee lines. Internal consistency is strong; the 2025 model inputs for NII ($2,948M) and expenses ($9,744M) reconcile precisely with the 'roughly flat' and '2%-3% growth' narrative provided in the text. However, the report is subject to a hard cap of 'Fair' because it lacks quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario modeling for its material drivers. While the analyst qualitatively discusses risks related to equity market levels and interest rate volatility, there are no quantified ranges (e.g., Bull/Bear cases or sensitivity matrices) showing how specific changes in AUM or NIM would impact the $90.00 fair value estimate. This 'black-box' element regarding valuation sensitivity prevents a higher grade despite the high quality of the baseline inputs.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor primarily due to multiple significant internal contradictions between the narrative claims and the financial data tables, violating the consistency pillar. The analyst explicitly states a forecast for 'annual margin expansion' and 'solid but decelerating growth' over the next five years. However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table contradicts these claims: it shows a 290-basis-point contraction in operating margin for 2025 (34.3% to 31.4%) and a revenue growth acceleration in 2025 (10.8%) compared to 2024 (10.2%). Furthermore, there is a massive, unresolved discrepancy between the 'non-GAAP operating margin' of 47% cited in the text for 2024 and the 'Adjusted EBITDA Margin' of 35.3% provided in the table for the same period. While the report is explicit regarding key valuation inputs such as WACC (8.8%), the long-run tax rate (11.0%), and specific AI revenue targets ($250 million ARR), the lack of reconciliation between the narrative and the model summary renders the assumptions unreliable. Sensitivity analysis is also insufficient, limited to a single-point scenario regarding the revenue growth reduction required to justify the current market price, rather than providing robust quantified ranges for multiple material drivers. These failures to maintain internal coherence and provide comprehensive stress-testing trigger the hard caps for a Poor rating.",

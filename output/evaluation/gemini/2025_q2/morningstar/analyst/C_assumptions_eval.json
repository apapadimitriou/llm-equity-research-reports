    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for Citigroup's turnaround, including NII growth, midcycle revenue, and ROTCE targets. These are well-justified through comparisons with historical 10-year averages and management's own guidance. However, the report fails the consistency and sensitivity tests. There are at least three distinct numeric contradictions between the narrative and the valuation tables: the Cost of Equity is cited as 10% in the text but 9% in the summary table; the efficiency ratio is claimed to be 63% in the text while the table shows 66.5% for 2025; and the Fair Value/Tangible Book multiple is stated as 0.87x in the text versus 0.8x in the table. Furthermore, while the report mentions a 'bear-case' for tariffs in an analyst note, it lacks a robust, quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario table for primary valuation levers like interest rates, credit costs, or the Cost of Equity within the main report. Per the grading instructions, the presence of two or more distinct contradictions, combined with the lack of quantified sensitivities for material drivers, necessitates a 'Poor' grade.",

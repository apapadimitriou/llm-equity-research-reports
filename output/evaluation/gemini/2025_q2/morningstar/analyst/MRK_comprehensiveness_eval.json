    "grade": "Good",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is highly comprehensive, covering all mandatory sections including a detailed Analyst Note, Business Strategy, and a robust Capital Allocation assessment. It provides strong sector-specific KPIs for a biopharma firm, such as specific drug sales (Keytruda, Gardasil), peak sales estimates ($40B for Keytruda), and precise patent expiration timelines (2028 US cliff). The valuation section is a highlight, explicitly linking the reduction in Fair Value Estimate from $120 to $111 to specific operating drivers, namely the expected decline in Gardasil sales in China and uncertainty in US vaccine policy. Peer benchmarking is present through a detailed competitor comparison table (Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and ESG peer analysis. Evidence integration is consistent, with claims tied to recent earnings, the Verona acquisition, and regulatory developments. The report is capped at 'Good' rather than 'Excellent' because it lacks a quantitative scenario/sensitivity analysis table (e.g., a Bull/Bear case valuation matrix or WACC sensitivity grid), although qualitative scenario discussion is present in the extensive Analyst Notes archive regarding tariff and policy impacts.",

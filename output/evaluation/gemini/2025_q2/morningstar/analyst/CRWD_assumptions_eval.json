    "grade": "Fair",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report provides explicit and specific assumptions for its primary valuation drivers, including a 22% revenue CAGR over five years, GAAP gross margin expansion into the mid-80s, and long-term adjusted operating margins approaching 30% by 2030. These inputs are clearly stated and proximal to the forecasts they inform. Justification is provided through qualitative narratives regarding vendor consolidation, the 'land-and-expand' strategy, and the inherent scalability of software business models. Internal consistency is high, as the narrative targets for 2030 reconcile precisely with the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table. However, the report lacks any quantified sensitivity analysis or scenario-based valuation ranges for its material drivers. While it assigns a 'High' uncertainty rating and discusses qualitative risks such as competition and the July 19 outage impact, it does not provide the numerical stress-testing (e.g., FVE impact of varying WACC or growth rates) required for a higher grade. Per the instruction's hard caps, the absence of quantified sensitivity analysis on material drivers limits the final grade to 'Fair'.",

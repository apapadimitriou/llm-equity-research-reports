    "summary_reasoning": "The report demonstrates high originality through multiple decision-relevant syntheses and quantified original theses. The analyst goes beyond public headlines regarding Alphabet's antitrust challenges by providing a specific valuation for the Google Network business ($90 billion, or 5% of market cap) to contextualize potential divestiture impacts. Furthermore, the report presents a testable original thesis regarding search market share, forecasting a 6% CAGR for Google Search against a 10% broader market growth rate, specifically attributed to AI-driven query migration. The analysis of the Apple Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA) is particularly insightful, proposing a non-obvious 'nonexclusive equilibrium' where Apple maintains its $20 billion revenue stream by offering a list of search options rather than a single default. Financial synthesis is also strong; the analyst links massive AI-related capital expenditures to rising depreciation costs, concluding that these will likely offset efficiency gains to keep operating margins flat at 32%\u2014a nuanced take that counters generic 'scale-driven expansion' narratives. While the report contains some boilerplate in the 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' and 'Business Strategy' sections, the depth of the analyst notes and the specificity of the valuation drivers (e.g., TPU cost advantages for LLM training vs. peers) firmly place this in the Excellent category.",

    "grade": "Poor",
    "summary_reasoning": "The report is graded Poor due to the combination of a significant internal numeric contradiction and the total absence of quantified sensitivity analysis for material drivers. Under the mandatory decision rules, one contradiction paired with no quantified sensitivities necessitates a Poor rating. Specifically, the narrative in the 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (Page 8) states that the fiscal 2024 actual operating margin was 45%. However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table (Page 16) explicitly records the 2024 actual operating margin as 41.8%. This unresolved discrepancy between the text and the data table undermines the consistency and auditability of the model. Furthermore, while the report identifies critical drivers such as Azure growth and AI adoption, it provides no quantified stress-testing or scenario analysis within the document. The 'Bulls Say/Bears Say' section is entirely qualitative, and the report lacks a sensitivity matrix or range-based valuation (e.g., showing how the $505 fair value estimate would fluctuate under different Azure growth or margin assumptions). Although the assumptions are explicit and specific regarding magnitudes (13% revenue CAGR) and time horizons, the failure to reconcile internal data and the lack of quantified risk modeling result in a 'black-box' feel for the final valuation output.",

    "grade": "fair",
    "reasoning": "The report earns a 'fair' grade due to material internal contradictions between the narrative and the financial tables, specifically regarding free cash flow (FCF) and forecast revisions. The 'Fair Value and Profit Drivers' section (dated 7 Feb 2025) explicitly states that the analyst expects 'good revenue and free cash flow growth for years to come.' However, the 'Morningstar Valuation Model Summary' table (Page 15) forecasts a massive 53.5% decline in FCF for fiscal year 2025 ($42,235 million vs. $90,868 million in 2024). This sharp contraction is never reconciled in the base-case narrative, which instead uses generic language about growth.\n\nFurthermore, there is a disconnect in the 'Analyst Notes Archive.' The 2 May 2025 note claims that the analyst has 'not made meaningful changes' to the 2025 model, yet the 'Forecast Revisions' table (Page 16) shows that 2025 Operating Income was revised downward by nearly $5.8 billion (a 7.2% reduction) and 2025 Revenue was cut by over $6 billion. Additionally, the report header attributes the $240.00 Fair Value Estimate to 7 Feb 2025, but the 'Forecast Revisions' table lists the 7 Feb 2025 value as $240.11, suggesting a minor but unresolved data discrepancy. While the qualitative analysis of Amazon\u2019s moat and strategy is excellent and the flow between sections is logical, these quantitative misalignments trigger the 'fair' hard cap.",

    "grade": "excellent",
    "reasoning": "The report exhibits exceptional structural coherence and narrative flow, maintaining a unified argument across multiple updates. The June 2025 Analyst Note seamlessly integrates with the core February 2025 report by referencing the established $500 fair value estimate and wide moat rating while addressing new sector developments like stablecoins. Transitions are logical and provide clear connective tissue; for instance, the Capital Allocation section links management's international experience to the company's geographic growth strategy. The report is particularly strong in its handling of complex financial metrics, proactively distinguishing between 'net revenue' margins (used for narrative growth claims) and 'gross revenue' margins (presented in the financial tables), which prevents potential confusion regarding the 58% versus 35.5% figures. The Analyst Notes Archive provides a transparent audit trail of the fair value increase from $465 to $500, with the Forecast Revisions table explicitly detailing the changes in assumptions. Temporal claims are precise, and the Bulls/Bears are well-reconciled with the base-case valuation. The internal math of the DCF model aligns with the summary valuation table, and the cost of equity is applied consistently. Minor discrepancies in table averages do not detract from the overall narrative integrity, as the core annual data points for revenue and operating income are mathematically consistent with the stated margins.",
    "evidence": [
        "The transition from the 30 Jan 2025 note ($465 FVE) to the 25 Feb 2025 update ($500 FVE) is explicitly documented in the Forecast Revisions table and Fair Value narrative (Page 4, 12).",
        "The report clarifies that 'operating margins (based on net revenue) to improve from 58% in 2024 to 61% by 2029' while the table shows gross margins remaining 'basically flat' (Page 4, 11).",
        "Connective tissue: 'Because the company turned to a company veteran for the CEO role, we didn\u2019t expect any major strategic pivots... and think this view has largely played out' (Capital Allocation, Page 5)."

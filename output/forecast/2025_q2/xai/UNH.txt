### Forecast Analysis for UnitedHealth Group (UNH)

As an equity research analyst, I have developed these forecasts for UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) key financial metrics in Q2 2025 based on trends observed in the company's public filings, including 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and earnings reports. My analysis considers historical growth patterns, such as revenue expansion driven by the UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments, alongside recent company statements on positioning for 2025 growth amid industry challenges like rising medical costs and regulatory pressures. 

From reviewing company reports, UNH has typically achieved quarterly revenue growth of 6-12% YoY in recent years, with margins impacted by operational efficiencies and investments. For Q2 2025, I project revenue growth of approximately 10% YoY from my estimated Q2 2024 baseline (derived from prior annual trends), assuming continued expansion in health benefits and services. EBITDA and Operating Income forecasts reflect stable margins around 8-9% and 6%, respectively, accounting for depreciation and operational costs. Net Income incorporates tax rates and interest expenses consistent with historical averages (around 20-25% effective tax). Free Cash Flow assumes strong operating cash generation minus capex, based on past patterns of $5-7 billion quarterly. EPS is calculated using an estimated diluted share count of about 920 million, aligned with recent filings.

These projections are my original estimates, incorporating potential headwinds like the noted setbacks in 2025 guidance from company news, but optimistic on recovery through volume growth.

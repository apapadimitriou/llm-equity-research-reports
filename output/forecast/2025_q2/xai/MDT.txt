### Forecast Analysis for Medtronic plc (MDT) - 2025-Q2

As an equity research analyst, I am forecasting key financial metrics for Medtronic plc's fiscal 2025 Q2 (covering approximately August to October 2024, based on the company's fiscal calendar). My projections are based solely on public sources such as Medtronic's recent 10-K and 10-Q filings, investor relations reports, and company news releases. Specifically, I referenced the FY2024 full-year results (released May 23, 2024) highlighting broad-based growth in areas like Cranial & Spinal Technologies, Diabetes, Cardiac Pacing, Surgical, and Structural Heart, as well as the Q3 FY2025 earnings release (February 18, 2025) emphasizing durable revenue growth and strength in Pulsed Field Ablation, Pacing, Structural Heart, Diabetes, and Neuromodulation. No external analyst reports or third-party estimates were used; this is my original analysis.

To derive these forecasts, I assumed a year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 5% for Q2 FY2025, driven by the company's momentum in innovative medtech segments and global market expansion, as noted in the public reports. This aligns with historical quarterly patterns where Q2 revenue has been around 25% of annual totals. Margins are projected to improve slightly due to operational efficiencies and scale in high-growth areas, with EBITDA margin around 32%, operating margin at 22%, and net margin at 14%, based on trends from FY2024 and Q3 FY2025 commentary. Free cash flow incorporates expected capital expenditures and working capital changes, while EPS accounts for approximately 1.33 billion diluted shares outstanding, consistent with recent filings. These are conservative estimates assuming stable macroeconomic conditions and no major disruptions.

All figures are expressed in full numbers without units (e.g., revenue in actual dollars, not millions).

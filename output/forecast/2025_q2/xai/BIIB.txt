### Original Analysis and Reasoning
As an equity research analyst, I am forecasting key financial metrics for Biogen Inc. (BIIB) for Q2 2025 based on public sources such as the company's historical 10-K and 10-Q filings, annual reports available on their investor relations website, and recent news updates on financial performance. From these sources, Biogen's historical quarterly revenue has typically ranged around $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years, with some volatility due to product portfolio changes, including contributions from drugs like Spinraza, Vumerity, and emerging treatments like Leqembi. Net income has been impacted by R&D expenses and competition in the biotech space.

For my forecast, I assume moderate growth driven by potential increases in product sales and cost efficiencies. Specifically, I project a 5% year-over-year revenue growth from estimated Q2 2024 levels (based on historical trends from Yahoo Finance income statements and Statista revenue data up to 2023), factoring in positive momentum from recent bullish news on biotech sector recovery. EBITDA and operating income margins are estimated at 35% and 25%, respectively, reflecting improved operational leverage. Net income assumes a 20% margin after taxes and other expenses. Free cash flow is projected conservatively, accounting for capex and working capital needs. EPS is calculated using an estimated diluted share count of approximately 145 million, derived from recent 10-Q filings. These projections are my original estimates, not copied from external analyst reports or consensus figures.

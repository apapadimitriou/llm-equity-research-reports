# Morgan Stanley Q2 2025 Forecast

As an equity analyst, we base our Q2 2025 projections on Morgan Stanley’s recent performance and industry trends up to early July 2025. The firm’s Q1 2025 earnings showed strong momentum, and year-over-year (YoY) comparisons indicate continued growth into Q2. Below we detail our forecasts for key metrics, followed by a summary table of the projections.

- **Revenue:** Morgan Stanley reported **record net revenues of $17.7 billion in Q1 2025**, a 17% jump from $15.1 billion in Q1 2024 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20Reports%20Net%20Revenues,0)). This momentum is expected to carry into Q2 2025. In the year-ago quarter (Q2 2024), Morgan Stanley’s revenue was **$15.0 billion**, up 11% from Q2 2023 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,%2455.24)). Given the robust performance in Q1 and a healthier market environment, we project Q2 2025 revenue of roughly **$16.5 billion** – about a 10% YoY increase. This reflects strong institutional trading activity and a recovering investment banking pipeline (management noted **“robust investment banking pipelines and client engagement”** heading into mid-2025 ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-morgan-stanley-beats-q1-2025-expectations-with-strong-eps-93CH-3981816#:~:text=During%20the%20earnings%20call%2C%20analysts,year))). Steady growth in the Wealth Management division (which saw **6% YoY net revenue growth in Q1 2025** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542125000343/ms-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L886%20Net%20interest,N%2FM)) on record client assets) also contributes to higher overall revenues.

- **EBITDA & Operating Income:** We anticipate improved profitability on the higher revenues. Morgan Stanley’s **expense efficiency ratio improved to 72% in Q2 2024 from 78% in Q2 2023 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Pre,))**, thanks to cost discipline and economies of scale. We expect further efficiency gains in Q2 2025 (approximately ~70% expense ratio), as the firm benefits from earlier cost-cutting efforts (Q1 2025 included some one-time severance costs ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=,Common%20Equity%20Tier%201%20capital)) that won’t recur). Consequently, **operating income (pre-tax)** is forecast around **$4.4 billion** for Q2 2025, up from $4.07 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,%2455.24)). Morgan Stanley also incurs substantial non-cash expenses (for example, **$865 million in depreciation and amortization in Q1 2025** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542125000343/ms-20250331.htm#:~:text=Adjustments%20to%20reconcile%20net%20income,975)), largely from intangibles related to past acquisitions). Adding back such costs, we estimate **EBITDA** for Q2 2025 of roughly **$5.3 billion**. This higher EBITDA reflects the strong core operating performance before accounting for depreciation/amortization.

- **Net Income & EPS:** With higher revenues and improved margins, **net income** in Q2 2025 should rise solidly from the prior year. In Q2 2024, Morgan Stanley earned **$3.08 billion in net income** ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Pre,%241.24)). We project around **$3.4 billion** net income for Q2 2025. Importantly, Morgan Stanley has been aggressively returning capital to shareholders via buybacks, which reduces the share count and boosts EPS. As of April 30, 2025, the firm had approximately **1.604 billion common shares outstanding** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542125000343/ms-20250331.htm#:~:text=As%20of%20April%2030%2C%202025%2C,01%20per%20share%2C%20outstanding)) (down from ~1.65 billion a year earlier). This means earnings are spread across fewer shares. Combining the higher net income and lower share count, we forecast **EPS** of roughly **$2.10** for Q2 2025. This would be an increase from the $1.82 EPS reported in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Pre,%2455.24)), reflecting double-digit growth driven by both improved profits and share repurchases.

- **Free Cash Flow:** Banks do not explicitly report “free cash flow” each quarter, but Morgan Stanley’s strong earnings and modest capital expenditure needs allow it to convert a large portion of profits into free cash. We estimate **free cash flow** of about **$4.0 billion** for Q2 2025. This assumes Morgan Stanley’s net income (plus non-cash charges like depreciation) is largely available for equity holders, given relatively low capex requirements. The firm’s ability to **accrete $1.5 billion of capital in Q2 2024 while still returning capital to shareholders** ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240715048014/en/Morgan-Stanley-Second-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=,16)) illustrates its robust cash generation. We expect a similar pattern in Q2 2025, enabling significant cash available for dividends and buybacks (in line with the bank’s ongoing capital return plans).

The table below summarizes our Q2 2025 forecasts for Morgan Stanley:

| Company         | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS  |
|-----------------|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Morgan Stanley  | 2025 | 2       | 16,500,000,000  | 5,300,000,000  | 4,400,000,000    | 3,400,000,000   | 4,000,000,000    | 2.10 |

Each of these projections is grounded in publicly available data and recent trends (up to July 2, 2025). They represent an analyst’s informed expectations for Morgan Stanley’s Q2 2025 performance, assuming continued strength in trading and wealth management, a gradual rebound in investment banking activity, and effective cost management.

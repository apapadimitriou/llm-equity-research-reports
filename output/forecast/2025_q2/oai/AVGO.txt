## Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) – Q2 2025 Forecast

Broadcom’s second fiscal quarter of 2025 is expected to show robust growth driven by its semiconductor and software businesses. The company guided Q2 FY2025 revenues of roughly **$14.9 billion** – about a 19% year-over-year increase ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=40%20percent%20of%20revenue%20,1)) – on continued **strong demand for AI chips and contributions from the VMware acquisition** ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,growth%20in%20AI%20semiconductor%20revenue)). This would equate to **~$15.0 billion in revenue**, up from $12.5 billion in Q2 last year. Broadcom indicated that AI-related sales alone would be around **$4.4 billion** in the quarter ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=year,solutions%20for%20AI%20data%20centers)), underscoring AI and cloud as key growth drivers.

**Profitability** is expected to remain very high. Broadcom projected an **Adjusted EBITDA margin** of about **66%** for Q2 ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,1)), which yields approximately **$9.9–10.0 billion in EBITDA** for the quarter. However, due to large amortization of acquired intangibles and other expenses from recent acquisitions, **GAAP operating income** and **net income** margins will be considerably lower. We forecast **GAAP operating income** of roughly **$5.8 billion** and **net income** around **$5.0 billion** for Q2. This represents a dramatic improvement from the year-ago Q2 GAAP profit of only **$2.12 billion** ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,)) (when merger-related amortization sharply reduced earnings). 

Broadcom’s cash generation is expected to be strong as well. The company consistently converts a large portion of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF); for example, Q1 FY2025 free cash flow was about **40% of revenue** ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,EBITDA%20guidance%20of%20approximately%2066)). In Q2, with higher earnings and stable capital spending, we anticipate FCF on the order of **$6.4 billion** (over 40% of sales). Finally, based on the net income projection (~$5.0B) and Broadcom’s post-split share count (≈4.8 billion diluted shares), **earnings per share** for Q2 FY2025 is estimated at **approximately $1.05**, a significant jump from about **$0.44** in the prior-year quarter ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=%7C%20%2B44%20%20%7C%20,0.48)).

| Company       | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |

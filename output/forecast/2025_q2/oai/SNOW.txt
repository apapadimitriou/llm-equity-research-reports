# Snowflake Inc. – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

**Forecast Summary:** The table below presents our projections for Snowflake’s financial performance in the second quarter of 2025 (calendar Q2 2025, which aligns with Snowflake’s fiscal Q2 2026, ending around July 2025). All figures are on a GAAP basis and expressed as absolute dollar amounts (no abbreviations or currency symbols). We base these forecasts on Snowflake’s reported historical results and publicly issued guidance up to August 13, 2025, combined with our independent analysis.

| Company         | Year | Quarter | Revenue           | EBITDA           | Operating Income    | Net Income        | Free Cash Flow    | EPS    |
|-----------------|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Snowflake Inc.  | 2025 | 2       | 1,090,000,000     | -300,000,000     | -350,000,000        | -340,000,000      | 80,000,000        | -1.02  |

**Key Assumptions and Rationale:**

- **Revenue:** We project Q2 2025 revenue of approximately **$1.09 billion**, about 25% higher year-over-year. Snowflake reported $868.8 million in revenue in the year-ago quarter ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,2)). The company’s guidance for product revenue in this quarter was $1.035–1.040 billion (25% YoY growth) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000094/fy2026q1earnings.htm#:~:text=,income%20per%20share%20attributable%20to)). Our forecast assumes Snowflake modestly exceeds its guidance, reflecting the company’s tendency to outperform conservative forecasts (as seen in Q1). This implies strong customer consumption trends and continued high retention (Q1 FY2026 net revenue retention was 124% ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=,year%20growth)) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=of%20fiscal%202026%2C%20ended%20April,30%2C%202025))). We also expect a slight contribution from professional services, resulting in total revenue around $1.09B.

- **Profitability (EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income):** Snowflake remains in an investment phase, so we anticipate a **GAAP operating loss** around **$350 million** for Q2. This is roughly in line with the $355.3 million operating loss in the prior-year quarter ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,7)), with a slight improvement as revenue growth outpaces operating expense growth. High stock-based compensation continues to weigh on GAAP profits – in Q1 FY2026, stock comp was about 40% of revenue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000094/fy2026q1earnings.htm#:~:text=Stock,)). However, Snowflake’s focus on cost discipline and slowing hiring should gradually improve margins. The company’s own outlook for Q2 FY2026 targets an ~8% **non-GAAP** operating margin ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000094/fy2026q1earnings.htm#:~:text=,income%20per%20share%20attributable%20to)), indicating improving core profitability after excluding non-cash expenses. We therefore forecast **EBITDA** (adding back depreciation/amortization to operating income) around **-$300 million** and a GAAP **net loss** around **$340 million**. This net loss is slightly wider than the $317.8 million loss a year ago ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=GAAP%20net%20loss%20%20,)), primarily due to growth in stock-based compensation and any investment losses, partially offset by higher interest income on Snowflake’s cash balance. We assume interest income near current levels and minimal tax expense, given Snowflake’s loss position.

- **Free Cash Flow:** We expect **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** to remain positive at roughly **$80 million** in Q2 2025, up from $58.8 million in the year-ago quarter ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,7)). Snowflake’s business model converts a portion of its growth into cash flow, aided by upfront customer payments and improving operating efficiency. In the prior year, Q2 FCF margin was about 7%. For this quarter we model a similar to slightly higher FCF margin (around 7–8% of revenue), consistent with Snowflake’s guidance for a full-year FY2026 adjusted FCF margin of 25% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000016/fy2025q4earnings.htm#:~:text=Product%20revenue%20%20,)). The increase in FCF is driven by higher scale and stable renewal activity, though tempered by the timing of cash collections (Q4 and Q1 are seasonally stronger for cash flows). Capital expenditures and capitalized software costs are assumed to remain at a modest level (in line with prior quarters), so the bulk of operating cash flow flows through to free cash flow.

- **Earnings Per Share:** We forecast **EPS** of approximately **-$1.02** for the quarter, versus a GAAP loss of $0.95 per share in the prior-year period ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=GAAP%20net%20loss%20per%20share,net%20loss%20per%20share%20attributable)). This estimate is based on the projected net loss above and an average diluted share count of roughly 330–335 million shares. Snowflake has been repurchasing shares (offsetting stock issuance); accordingly, we assume the share count remains around the level of recent quarters ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=GAAP%20net%20loss%20per%20share,)). The slight increase in loss per share year-over-year reflects the fact that GAAP net losses are still expanding modestly, as discussed, despite strong revenue growth. We note that on a non-GAAP basis (excluding stock-based comp and other one-time items), Snowflake is profitable – but GAAP EPS will continue to show a loss until those non-cash expenses moderate.

Overall, our Q2 2025 forecasts assume Snowflake will demonstrate solid revenue growth in line with guidance and continued improvements in underlying (non-GAAP) profitability, while GAAP earnings remain negative due to heavy stock-based compensation. We will look for management’s report (scheduled around late August 2025) to compare against these estimates, paying close attention to any updates on consumption trends, profitability metrics, and cash flow trajectory. Our projections are based solely on information available up to August 13, 2025, including Snowflake’s 10-Q filings, press releases, and guidance statements ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000094/fy2026q1earnings.htm#:~:text=,income%20per%20share%20attributable%20to)) ([investors.snowflake.com](https://investors.snowflake.com/news/news-details/2024/Snowflake-Reports-Financial-Results-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?os=avDavDXHup&ref=app#:~:text=Operating%20income%20%28loss%29%20%20,7)), and reflect independent analysis of those public sources.

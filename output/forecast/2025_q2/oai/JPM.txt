# JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Recent Performance and Baseline 
JPMorgan Chase entered Q2 2025 with strong momentum from prior quarters. In Q1 2025, the bank posted **revenue of $45.3 billion** (8% year-over-year growth) and **net income of $14.6 billion** (9% growth) ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20reported%20an%208,This%20sharp)). This performance was fueled by booming fee income – noninterest revenue jumped 17%, with Markets (trading) revenue up 21% and investment banking fees up 12% ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=%2445,pressured%20by%20a%20substantial%2075)). However, credit costs have been rising: provision for credit losses was **$3.3 billion** in Q1 (up 75% YoY) ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=generating%20businesses%2C%20with%20noninterest%20revenue,outlook%20shifts%20and%20specific%20credit)), reflecting a more cautious economic outlook. 

The year-ago quarter (Q2 2024) provides a high baseline due to one-time gains. JPMorgan reported **$50.99 billion** in managed revenue for Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=Markets%28c%29%20%20,14)), boosted by a **$7.9 billion** gain from exchanging Visa shares ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=Visa%20shares%3A%20On%20April%208%2C,period%20ended%20June%2030%2C%202024)). This gain inflated net income to **$18.1 billion** (or $6.12 per share) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%2418,contributions%20to%20the%20Firm%27s%20Foundation)). Excluding the Visa gain (and a related $1.0 billion charitable donation expense ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=Visa%20shares%3A%20On%20April%208%2C,period%20ended%20June%2030%2C%202024))), core Q2 2024 net income was about **$13.1 billion** ( ~$4.40 EPS) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%2418,contributions%20to%20the%20Firm%27s%20Foundation)). This normalized prior-year base is important for comparison, as our Q2 2025 forecasts assume no similar one-off benefits.

## Key Factors Affecting Q2 2025 Outlook
**Net Interest Income (NII):** JPMorgan’s NII – its largest revenue component – is expected to remain solid but not surge. In May 2024 the bank raised its 2024 NII forecast to **$91 billion** (from ~$90B) on the view that interest rates would stay higher for longer ([www.ndtvprofit.com](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/jpmorgan-lifts-full-year-nii-guidance-ahead-of-investor-day#:~:text=The%20company%20now%20expects%20to,it%20published%20guidance%20in%20January)). The Federal Reserve was anticipated to cut rates only marginally in late 2024, supporting continued high interest income. Indeed, Q1 2024 NII was up 11% YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000315/a1q24erfexhibit991narrative.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%2413,excluding%20First%20Republic)), and Q2 2024 still grew 4% YoY to **$22.9 billion** ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=match%20at%20L214%20Net%20revenue,related%20net%20interest%20income)). By Q1 2025, however, management noted signs of “normalization” – NII had **declined 4% sequentially** and deposit margins were under pressure ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000315/a1q24erfexhibit991narrative.htm#:~:text=return%20profile%2C%20without%20compromising%20our,significant%20number%20of%20new%20client)). Looking ahead, JPMorgan expects NII to flatten out as deposit costs catch up and rate cuts eventually loom ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000315/a1q24erfexhibit991narrative.htm#:~:text=return%20profile%2C%20without%20compromising%20our,significant%20number%20of%20new%20client)). We therefore project Q2 2025 NII to be roughly flat versus a year ago (around the mid-$22 billion range), similar to Q1 2025 levels. Modest loan growth and a stabilizing deposit base (average deposits were up 2% YoY in Q1 2025 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-1Q25-Earnings-Press-Release-49597576/#:~:text=,YoY))) should help offset continued deposit repricing. Overall, we anticipate **stable interest income** in Q2, rather than significant growth, in line with management’s guidance. 

**Fee and Markets Revenue:** JPMorgan’s noninterest revenue is poised to **grow modestly** on an underlying basis. Capital markets activity has been rebounding from the trough of 2022–2023. In Q2 2024, investment banking fees were up over 50% year-over-year as equity and debt issuance picked up ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-earnings-q2-2024.html#:~:text=Skip%20Navigation%20Key%20Points%20,topping%20the%20consensus%20estimate%20of)), and trading results were strong (Markets revenue grew ~10% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=NIR%20excluding%20Markets%28c%29%20%20,14)). That spike sets a higher comparison base for Q2 2025, so we do not expect another huge jump. However, the **improving deal pipeline** and solid trading performance seen in early 2025 should continue to support fees. In Q1 2025, management noted record trading in equities and healthier investment banking activity ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=%2445,pressured%20by%20a%20substantial%2075)). **Equity and bond market conditions in Q2 2025 remained generally favorable**, so JPMorgan’s trading desks likely delivered robust (if not record) results. We therefore assume moderate YoY growth in noninterest revenue (excluding last year’s Visa gain). Areas like card income and asset management fees are also contributing, thanks to consumer spending and higher asset prices (client investment assets were up 7% YoY in Q1) ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-1Q25-Earnings-Press-Release-49597576/#:~:text=,YoY)). Our forecast envisions **total managed revenue around $45–46 billion** for Q2 2025, representing mid to high single-digit growth over the *underlying* year-ago revenue (approximately $42.3B excluding the Visa gain). 

**Expenses:** JPMorgan has been investing in technology, talent, and growth initiatives, while also absorbing acquisitions like First Republic. Underlying operating expenses rose ~9% YoY in Q2 2024 (excluding the Visa donation) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=Noninterest%20expense%20was%20%2423,related%20compensation%20and%20growth%20in)), and were **$23.7 billion** including that one-time item. We project Q2 2025 expenses in the mid-$24 billion range, reflecting high-single-digit growth. Inflationary pressures on salaries and continued hiring (headcount was up ~4% YoY in mid-2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=317%2C371%C2%A0%20%20,))) contribute to expense growth. That said, efficiency should remain decent – JPMorgan’s cost-to-revenue “overhead ratio” was ~52% in Q1 2025 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-1Q25-Earnings-Press-Release-49597576/#:~:text=,offs%20and%20a%20%24973)). We expect a similar ratio in Q2 2025 (around 53%), assuming no large unusual costs. This implies **operating expense near $24–25 billion** for the quarter.

**Credit Costs:** The bank has proactively built reserves as the credit cycle normalizes from unusually low loss levels. In Q2 2024, provision for credit losses was **$3.1 billion** ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=,YoY%2C%20flat%20QoQ)), up slightly from the prior year. By Q1 2025, quarterly provision had risen to **$3.3 billion** ([www.panabee.com](https://www.panabee.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-q1-quarterly-earnings-2025#:~:text=generating%20businesses%2C%20with%20noninterest%20revenue,outlook%20shifts%20and%20specific%20credit)), including nearly $1 billion in reserve build. Management signaled that credit costs will continue “normalizing” upward amid macro uncertainties ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000315/a1q24erfexhibit991narrative.htm#:~:text=return%20profile%2C%20without%20compromising%20our,significant%20number%20of%20new%20client)). We anticipate JPMorgan will maintain a sizable provision in Q2 2025 – roughly **$3.5 billion** in our model – to cover loan growth and any deterioration in credit quality. Actual net charge-offs have been rising (e.g. card loan losses increased as consumer credit normalizes) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=The%20provision%20for%20credit%20losses,primarily%20in%20Card%20Services%2C%20and)). A reserve build in Q2 2025 would bolster JPM’s defenses, though it weighs on operating profit. We assume credit costs remain elevated but not dramatically higher than Q1’s level, barring any major economic shock by late June.

**Shares Outstanding:** JPMorgan has been returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. The firm repurchased about $2 billion of common stock in Q1 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000315/a1q24erfexhibit991narrative.htm#:~:text=CAPITAL%20DISTRIBUTIONS)). We expect the share count to decline slightly by Q2. For EPS forecasts, we use an estimated **2.85 billion diluted shares**, a bit lower than the ~2.89 billion average in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000453/jpm-20240630.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%3A%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Basic%20%20,2%2C960.5)).

## Q2 2025 Forecast Summary 
Taking the above factors into account, we forecast **solid core earnings growth** for JPMorgan in Q2 2025 versus the normalized year-ago quarter. **Revenue** is projected at about **$45.5 billion**, up roughly 7% from Q2 2024’s core revenue (and essentially flat sequentially from Q1 2025). This reflects stable net interest income and a modest uptick in fees and other income. We expect **operating profit** to improve year-on-year, but at a more moderate pace given higher loan loss provisions. Our forecast yields an **operating income (pre-tax)** around **$17–18 billion**. After an estimated $3.8B of taxes (aprox. 21% effective rate), we project **net income** of roughly **$14 billion** for the quarter – about 7–8% above the $13.1B underlying profit in Q2 last year. **EPS** is forecast at approximately **$5.00**, up from the $4.40 core EPS a year ago (not comparable to the $6.12 reported with one-offs) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-2Q24-Earnings-Press-Release-47371053/#:~:text=Net%20income%20was%20%2418,contributions%20to%20the%20Firm%27s%20Foundation)). We also anticipate strong **free cash flow** generation on the order of **$13+ billion** in Q2. Banks do not report “free cash flow” explicitly, but given JPMorgan’s earnings and relatively modest capital expenditure needs, operating cash flow should roughly track net income. (We note that loan growth or changes in deposits can swing actual cash flow in banking; absent unusual movements, JPM’s **cash generation should remain robust**, enabling continued dividends and buybacks.)

The table below summarizes our forecasts for JPMorgan’s Q2 2025 results:

| Company               | Year | Quarter | Revenue           | EBITDA            | Operating Income   | Net Income        | Free Cash Flow    | EPS   |
|-----------------------|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| JPMorgan Chase & Co.  | 2025 | 2       | 45,500,000,000    | 21,500,000,000    | 17,000,000,000     | 14,000,000,000    | 13,000,000,000    | 5.00  |

**Note:** Figures are in USD. Revenue, EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income, and Free Cash Flow are expressed in full dollars (not millions). Quarter “2” denotes Q2. EBITDA for a bank is approximated here as earnings before taxes + interest + depreciation/amortization; we have used pre-provision profit plus an add-back for depreciation as a proxy. Free cash flow is projected as cash generated from operations minus capital expenditures, which for banks is roughly net income (adjusted for non-cash items and loan/deposit changes). These forecasts are based on information available up to July 1, 2025 and assume no further extraordinary items or economic shocks in the quarter.

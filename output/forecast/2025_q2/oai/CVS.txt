# CVS Health Corp – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

**Revenue:** We project CVS Health’s Q2 2025 revenue at approximately **$98.5 billion**. This represents a high-single-digit increase year-over-year from the $91.2 billion in Q2 2024 ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,0%20billion)). Last year’s Q2 saw only 2.6% growth as strong gains in the Health Care Benefits (insurance) and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness (retail pharmacy) segments were partly offset by a decline in the Health Services segment ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20increased%202.6,to%20the%20decrease%20in%20adjusted)). The Health Services unit (pharmacy benefits and provider services) was impacted by the loss of a major client in 2024 ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20decreased%208.8,mix%2C%20increased%20contributions%20from%20the)), which suppressed overall revenue growth. In Q2 2025 that headwind has fully annualized, and we anticipate **broad-based growth across all segments**. The insurance segment should continue expanding – Q1 2025 insurance revenues were up ~8% driven by Medicare and commercial membership growth ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20increased%208.0,for%20the%202025%20payment%20year)) – and pharmacy retail sales are benefiting from higher prescription volumes and new specialty drugs. Additionally, acquisitions like Signify Health and Oak Street Health (completed in 2023) now contribute for the full quarter, bolstering Health Services revenues ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20decreased%208.8,mix%2C%20increased%20contributions%20from%20the)). Overall, with these tailwinds and no new large contract losses, Q2 2025 is expected to show significantly stronger top-line growth than the prior-year period.

**Profitability (EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income, EPS):** We forecast a substantial improvement in profitability for Q2 2025 versus a year ago. In Q2 2024, CVS’s operating income and earnings were depressed by **elevated medical cost trends and an unfavorable Medicare Advantage star rating** that hurt its insurance margins ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=Second%20quarter%C2%A0GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of,within%20the%20Medicare%20product%20line)). By contrast, 2025’s star ratings improved, leading to better reimbursement and lower medical cost ratios ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20increased%208.0,for%20the%202025%20payment%20year)). In Q1 2025 CVS already saw operating income jump ~49% year-over-year (on a comparable adjusted basis) as the insurance segment’s performance rebounded ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenues%20increased%207.0,These%20increases%20were%20partially)). We expect this trend to continue in Q2. Our **Operating Income** forecast is about **$3.7 billion**, up from $3.0 billion GAAP operating profit in Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Financial%20Results%20Summary%20,3%2C045)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Continue%20Reading)). This improvement reflects healthier insurance underwriting results (due to more moderate utilization and higher 2025 star bonuses) and growth in the pharmacy and healthcare services businesses, along with the absence of last year’s one-time charges. We anticipate **EBITDA** of roughly **$4.9 billion** for the quarter, adding back roughly $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization to our operating income estimate (vs. about $4.2 billion EBITDA in Q2 2024, based on that quarter’s D&A of ~$1.15 billion) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,270)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,effects%20from%20acquisitions%3A)). After accounting for interest expense on CVS’s debt (which rose in 2024 due to debt-funded acquisitions) and a normalized effective tax rate, we project **Net Income** of approximately **$2.1 billion** for Q2 2025, about 20% higher than the $1.77 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Adjusted%20operating%20income%20,%28146%29)). Consequently, **EPS** (GAAP) is expected to increase to around **$1.66** per share, compared to $1.41 in the prior-year quarter ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,0%20billion)). This anticipated earnings growth underscores the improved operating environment in 2025, while we remain mindful of potential cost pressures and integration expenses that CVS management has cautiously flagged ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Company%20updated%20its%20full,the%20potential%20for%20macro%20headwinds)) ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,5%20billion)). 

**Free Cash Flow:** CVS Health’s cash generation in Q2 2025 should remain solid. The company’s operations are highly cash-generative, though cash flow is typically **front-loaded in the first half** of the year due to the timing of insurance premiums and claim payments ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,0%20billion)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Accounts%20payable%20and%20pharmacy%20claims,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%207%2C992)). In the first half of 2024, CVS produced $8.0 billion of operating cash flow ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,0%20billion)), with a particularly strong contribution in Q1. In Q1 2025, net cash from operating activities was $4.6 billion ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=First%20Quarter%20Financial%20Highlights)), and CVS raised its full-year 2025 cash flow guidance to about $7.0 billion from $6.5 billion, reflecting confidence in underlying cash generation ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS-AND-UPDATES-FULL-YEAR-2025-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,5%20billion)). For Q2 2025, we expect operating cash flow to moderate relative to Q1 (as medical cost payouts catch up from earlier in the year), but still remain positive. After factoring in roughly **$0.7 billion in capital expenditures** (CVS’s capex was $1.34 billion in the first half of 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-health-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-and-revises-full-year-2024-guidance-302216498.html#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20investments%20%20,%283%2C719%29)), indicating about $0.7 billion per quarter on average), we project **Free Cash Flow** around **$1.6 billion** for Q2 2025. This level of FCF assumes CVS continues to generate healthy cash from its retail and PBM businesses and improved cash earnings from the insurance segment, while funding its store improvements, technology, and integration of recent acquisitions. The table below summarizes our Q2 2025 forecasts for CVS Health Corp:

| Company          | Year | Quarter | Revenue          | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |

# Forecast for State Street Corporation – Q2 2025 Financial Metrics

## Revenue and Fee Income  
State Street’s revenue is expected to grow modestly in Q2 2025, building on prior trends. In Q2 2024, the bank achieved **3% year-over-year revenue growth** to **$3.19 billion** on the back of higher fee revenues ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=contributed%20to%20higher%20fee%20revenues,to%20%244.42%20trillion%2C%20driven)). Assets under management (AUM) surged to a record **$4.42 trillion** that quarter (up 16% year-on-year), which boosted fee income ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=contributed%20to%20higher%20fee%20revenues,to%20%244.42%20trillion%2C%20driven)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=revenue%20growth%2C%20with%20total%20quarterly,Despite)). Coming into 2025, momentum has improved: **Q1 2025 total revenue rose 5%** year-on-year (with fee revenue up 6%) as markets and client activity picked up ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/State-Street-1Q25-Press-Release-49646640/#:~:text=STATE%20STREET%20REPORTS%20FIRST%20QUARTER,04)). Management’s guidance for the full year 2025 calls for **fee revenue to increase ~3–5%** and **net interest income (NII) to remain roughly flat** versus 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/state-street-stt-q1-2025-earnings-call#:~:text=match%20at%20L349%20supportive%20from,with%20our%20prior%20guide%20and)). Given this outlook, we project Q2 2025 revenue will rise in the low single digits year-over-year. This implies **total revenue around $3.3 billion** in Q2 2025, assuming steady asset servicing wins and resilient market valuations support continued fee growth.  

## Expenses and Operating Income  
State Street has been focusing on expense discipline to drive operating leverage. In Q2 2024, the firm’s **net profit slipped ~7% to $711 million** as rising costs outpaced revenue gains ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=by%20a%20robust%20rally%20in,to%20%24735%20million%2C%20attributed%20to)). However, recent results show improved cost control – for example, **Q1 2025 expenses fell 3%** year-on-year (or rose ~3% excluding a prior-year one-time FDIC charge) ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/State-Street-1Q25-Press-Release-49646640/#:~:text=EXPENSES%20DOWN%203,NOTABLES%28a)). Management achieved **positive operating leverage** in Q1 by keeping expense growth below revenue growth ([in.marketscreener.com](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/State-Street-1Q25-Press-Release-49646640/#:~:text=EXPENSES%20DOWN%203,NOTABLES%28a)), and we expect a similar approach in Q2. We assume operating expenses in Q2 2025 will increase only mildly (~3% year-on-year), despite inflationary pressures, due to ongoing efficiency initiatives. This cost discipline, combined with modest revenue growth, should expand margins. We forecast **operating income (pre-tax)** of roughly **$920 million** for Q2 2025, an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s level (mid-$800 millions by our estimate). In short, higher fee revenue and careful cost management are expected to lift State Street’s operating profit in Q2.  

## Net Income, EPS, and Free Cash Flow  
Reflecting the factors above, we project **Q2 2025 net income** of about **$740 million** for State Street, a mid-single-digit increase from the **$711 million** earned in Q2 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=by%20a%20robust%20rally%20in,to%20%24735%20million%2C%20attributed%20to)). This earnings growth, though modest, is aided by the absence of last year’s unusual expense spikes and a stable revenue environment. Additionally, **share repurchases** are amplifying earnings per share. State Street’s capital return plan targets **returning ~80% of earnings to shareholders** via buybacks and dividends ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/state-street-stt-q1-2025-earnings-call#:~:text=that%20we%20expect%20a%20progressive,shareholders%2C%20subject%20to%20market%20conditions)). The company’s share count has been steadily declining, which boosts EPS. We expect **Q2 2025 EPS** to reach approximately **2.50** (dollars per share), up markedly from roughly $2.10 in the prior-year quarter (estimated from Q2 2024 profit and share count) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/state-street-posts-higher-aum-revenue-beats-estimates-higher-fees-2024-07-16/#:~:text=by%20a%20robust%20rally%20in,to%20%24735%20million%2C%20attributed%20to)). Lastly, **free cash flow** generation should remain strong. Depreciation and amortization expense is about **$800+ million per year** (over $200 million per quarter) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000111/stt-20241231.htm#:~:text=use%20assets,million%20and%20%24842%20million%2C%20respectively)), and capital expenditures have been elevated (over **$900 million in 2024** on technology and a new headquarters) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000111/stt-20241231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L11385%20Purchases%20of,12%2C738)). However, we anticipate capex will moderate in 2025. As a result, **Q2 2025 free cash flow is forecast around $720 million**, roughly in line with net income. This assumes operating cash flows from the business can comfortably fund ongoing investments. The table below summarizes our forecasts for Q2 2025:

| Company                   | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow  | EPS  |
|---------------------------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------------:|----------------:|------|
| State Street Corporation  | 2025 | 2       | 3,330,000,000 | 1,050,000,000 | 920,000,000      | 740,000,000   | 720,000,000     | 2.50 |

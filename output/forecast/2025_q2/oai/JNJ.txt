# Johnson & Johnson – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

Johnson & Johnson’s **Q2 2025 revenue** is projected at roughly **$23.5 billion**, about 4–5% higher than Q2 2024’s $22.4 billion ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%202024%20Second,due)). This uptick reflects robust performance in the pharmaceuticals and medtech segments, plus contributions from recent acquisitions. Key growth drivers include oncology therapeutics (e.g. *Darzalex* for multiple myeloma, which saw ~20% YoY sales growth in Q1 2025 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q1-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=DARZALEX%20%20,2.2%20%20%7C))) and new neuroscience revenue from *Caplyta* (lumateperone). J&J **completed its $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies (maker of Caplyta) in April 2025** ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Closes-Landmark-Intra-Cellular-Therapies-Inc--Acquisition-to-Solidify-Neuroscience-Leadership/default.aspx#:~:text=NEW%20BRUNSWICK%2C%20N.J.,Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20Innovative%20Medicine)) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Closes-Landmark-Intra-Cellular-Therapies-Inc--Acquisition-to-Solidify-Neuroscience-Leadership/default.aspx#:~:text=04%2F02%2F2025)), so Q2 2025 will include Caplyta sales (FY2024 sales $680 million, +47% YoY ([ir.intracellulartherapies.com](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-10#:~:text=Fourth%20quarter%202024%20CAPLYTA%20net,the%20same%20period%20in%202023))) for the first time. Likewise, the **Shockwave Medical** acquisition (closed May 31, 2024 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Completes-Acquisition-of-Shockwave-Medical/default.aspx#:~:text=NEW%20BRUNSWICK%2C%20N.J.,a%20business%20unit%20within%20Johnson))) adds a full quarter of cardiovascular device revenue in Q2 2025 versus a minimal contribution last year. These factors should more than **offset declining immunology sales from Stelara**, J&J’s psoriasis drug now facing biosimilar competition – Stelara’s sales dropped ~33% YoY in Q1 2025 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q1-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=STELARA%20%20,1.4%20%20%7C)) and a similar decline is expected in Q2. Overall, strong oncology and new product momentum, plus the expanded medtech portfolio, are forecast to drive solid top-line growth in Q2 2025.

Profitability is also expected to improve. **EBITDA** and **Operating Income** for Q2 2025 are forecast at about **$8.9 billion** and **$7.0 billion**, respectively. This reflects modest margin expansion and the absence of large one-time charges that weighed on prior-year results. In Q2 2024, J&J’s GAAP operating profits were dampened by special items (e.g. an IPR&D impairment and other one-time expenses) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx)) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20from%20Continuing%20Operations,)). In 2025, excluding routine amortization of new acquisition intangibles, the underlying operating margin should remain healthy. **Net Income** is projected around **$5.8 billion**, up significantly from the $4.7 billion reported in Q2 2024 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=Reported%20Sales%20%20,5.9)). This YoY increase is driven by higher sales and fewer special charges, partly offset by higher amortization expense from recent acquisitions. J&J’s **Free Cash Flow** in Q2 2025 is estimated near **$6.0 billion**, supported by strong cash earnings and working-capital discipline. (For context, J&J generated ~$19.8 billion of free cash flow in full-year 2024 ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow%20%28YTD%29,%2488%2C821)) ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=Reported%20Sales%20,Net%20Earnings)), and cash generation is expected to keep pace with earnings growth in 2025.) Finally, **EPS** (diluted) for Q2 2025 is forecast at approximately **$2.40**, a healthy increase from the $1.93 EPS in the year-ago quarter ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%202024%20Second,due)).

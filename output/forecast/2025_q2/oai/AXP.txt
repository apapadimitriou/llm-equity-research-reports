## Recent Performance and Baseline for Forecast  
American Express (AXP) has shown steady growth through 2024, providing a strong baseline for the 2025-Q2 forecast. In Q2 2024, the company achieved record revenue of **$16.3 billion** (up 8% year-over-year) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Second,continued%20strong%20card%20fee%20growth)), with net income of **$3.0 billion** (or **$4.15** per share) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=second,49%2C%20up%2021)). That quarter’s earnings benefited from a one-time after-tax gain of $479 million from the sale of Accertify ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=performance,89)) – excluding this, adjusted EPS was **$3.49**, up 21% YoY ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=second,49%2C%20up%2021)). Subsequent quarters saw continued revenue momentum: Q3 2024 revenue grew 8% YoY to **$16.6 billion** ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Reports-Third-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-of-3.49-and-Raises-Full-Year-2024-EPS-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=10%20,6%20Billion)) and Q4 2024 rose 9% to **$17.2 billion** ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20Net%20of%20Interest,%7C%20%2414.01)). Profit growth, however, moderated as the company ramped up investment and built credit reserves – Q3 2024 net income was roughly flat (+2% YoY) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Reports-Third-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-of-3.49-and-Raises-Full-Year-2024-EPS-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=FX,20)), while Q4 2024 net income grew 12% ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20Net%20of%20Interest,%7C%20%2414.01)). For the full year 2024, American Express delivered **$10.1 billion** in net income (EPS of **$14.01**, up 25% YoY) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=FY%202024%20Earnings%20Per%20Share,to%20%2414.01)).  

**2025 has started on a solid note:** In Q1 2025, revenue reached **$17.0 billion** (7% YoY growth) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20Net%20of%20Interest,9)), driven by higher card member spending, loan growth, and fee income ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=First,Member%20spending%2C%20and%20continued%20strong)). Net income was **$2.6 billion** for Q1 (up 6% YoY) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%20,%283)), and diluted EPS came in at **$3.64** (up 9% YoY) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%20,%283)). The faster EPS growth reflects ongoing share buybacks – average diluted shares were 702 million in Q1 2025, ~3% lower than a year earlier ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%20,%283)). Notably, expenses in Q1 rose 10% YoY ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Consolidated%20expenses%20were%20%2412,estimating%20future%20Membership%20Rewards%20redemptions)), partly because the prior-year quarter had a benefit from a reserve adjustment (lowering 2024 costs) and due to higher customer engagement and travel reward costs in 2025 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Consolidated%20expenses%20were%20%2412,estimating%20future%20Membership%20Rewards%20redemptions)). This context of revenue growth and increased spending sets the stage for forecasting Q2 2025.  

## Q2 2025 Forecast Assumptions  
**Revenue:** American Express management guided for **8%–10% revenue growth** in 2025 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=FY%202024%20Earnings%20Per%20Share,to%20%2414.01)) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=FY%202025%20Guidance%20for%20Revenue,50)), and the company maintained this outlook after Q1. We anticipate Q2 2025 revenue will be near the upper half of that range, given continued strong card member spending and high travel-related volumes in the spring/early summer period. Net interest income is also expected to rise, supported by growth in card member loans and higher yields in a still-favorable rate environment. In Q2 2024, AXP’s revenue was $16.33 billion ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Second,continued%20strong%20card%20fee%20growth)), and we project roughly **9% YoY growth** for Q2 2025. This yields an estimated **$17.8 billion** in revenue for 2025-Q2 – a record level reflecting robust consumer and business demand.  

**EBITDA and Operating Income:** As a financial services company, American Express’s EBITDA is approximated by adding back depreciation/amortization to operating profit (which for AXP is essentially pre-tax income, since “Total revenues net of interest expense” already accounts for funding costs). In Q2 2024, underlying pre-tax income was about $3.26 billion (excluding the one-time gain) – a ~20% pretax margin on revenue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=performance,89)). Given anticipated operating leverage from revenue growth outpacing core expense growth, we expect **operating income (EBIT)** around **$3.6 billion** in Q2 2025. This represents solid growth on an underlying basis, even though it would be slightly below the $3.79 billion pretax profit reported in Q2 2024 that included the one-time gain ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm)). Key drivers are steady top-line gains and disciplined expense management. In Q1, the company kept marketing spend flat and saw only a modest 1% total expense increase in Q2 2024 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Second,continued%20strong%20card%20fee%20growth)); however, customer engagement costs (rewards, services) have been rising with spend volumes ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Delivers-Strong-First-Quarter-Results-With-Revenue-of-17-0-Billion-up-7-or-8-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Consolidated%20expenses%20were%20%2412,estimating%20future%20Membership%20Rewards%20redemptions)). For Q2 2025 we assume **mid-single-digit growth in operating expenses**, balancing continued investment in growth with cost control. We also model a slight increase in credit loss provisions given loan growth and normalization of credit metrics – e.g. Q2 2024 provisions were $1.27B ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Second,continued%20strong%20card%20fee%20growth)), and we assume roughly $1.4B for Q2 2025. Adding back an estimated ~$400 million in depreciation/amortization (similar to recent quarters), **EBITDA** is forecast at about **$4.0 billion** for the quarter.  

**Net Income and EPS:** With ~$3.6B in pretax income forecast, and assuming an effective tax rate in the ~22% range (in line with recent quarters) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L598%20benefits%20primarily,ended%20June%C2%A030%2C%202024%20and%202023)), **net income** is projected to be roughly **$2.8 billion** for Q2 2025. This would be a decrease versus the reported $3.0B in Q2 2024 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=second,49%2C%20up%2021)), but importantly last year’s figure included the large one-time gain. Excluding that, the forecast represents a healthy year-over-year increase in underlying profitability. The ongoing share repurchase program (over **$3.0 billion** spent on buybacks in the first half of 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=Proceeds%20from%20long,%281%2C349%29))) has reduced the share count, amplifying per-share earnings growth. We anticipate average diluted shares in Q2 2025 to be near **700 million** (down from ~717 million in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm)) due to buybacks). As a result, **EPS** for 2025-Q2 is forecast at approximately **$4.00**. This would compare favorably to the prior-year’s adjusted EPS of $3.49 (GAAP $4.15) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Raises-Full-Year-Earnings-Per-Share-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=second,49%2C%20up%2021)), showcasing double-digit growth on a normalized basis and keeping the company on track toward its full-year EPS goal of $15+ ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=FY%202024%20Earnings%20Per%20Share,to%20%2414.01)).  

**Free Cash Flow:** American Express’s **free cash flow (FCF)** can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, driven by changes in card loans, customer deposits, and working capital timing. In Q2 2024, the company saw exceptionally strong operating cash inflows – net cash from operating activities was $10.1 billion in the first half of 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=Adjustments%20to%20reconcile%20net%20income,800)), with Q2 alone contributing an outsized portion (FCF for Q2 2024 was about **$9.123 billion** after capex) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AXP/AXP/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,30%20%20%7C%2010%2C653.00)). That surge was partly due to timing benefits (e.g. **“higher net operating liabilities”** like payables/overdrafts) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20the%20net%20cash,the%20ordinary%20course%20of%20business)) and the Accertify sale proceeds. We expect Q2 2025 FCF to remain robust but normalize closer to the ongoing trend. Higher net income and strong cash earnings will contribute positively, while growth in card member loans (a use of cash) may moderate the operating cash flow. Capital expenditures have been around ~$0.9 billion for the first half of the year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=Net%20increase%20in%20loans%20and,12%2C516)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000052/axp-20240630.htm#:~:text=Purchase%20of%20premises%20and%20equipment%2C,7%2C966)), so roughly $0.5B in Q2. Taking these factors together, we project **Free Cash Flow of approximately $8.0 billion** for Q2 2025. This assumes American Express continues to generate substantial cash from its business, albeit a bit lower than the prior-year’s unusually high level.

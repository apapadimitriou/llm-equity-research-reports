## Amgen (AMGN) – Forecast for 2025 Q2 Financial Metrics

Amgen is expected to deliver solid year-over-year growth in **2025 Q2**, building on momentum from new product launches and the integration of Horizon Therapeutics’ portfolio. In the first quarter of 2025, Amgen’s revenues grew 9% (to about $8.1 billion) amid strong volume gains ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,cdon)). The second quarter of 2024 saw an unusually high 20% revenue jump (to $8.4 billion) due to the Horizon acquisition boost ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,ekko%29%2C%20BLINCYTO%5E%7B%C2%AE)). For 2025, Amgen guided full-year revenues of **$34.3–$35.7 billion**, implying mid-single-digit growth ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202025%2C,the%20Company%20expects)). We expect **2025 Q2 revenue** around **$9.1 billion**, roughly 8% higher year-on-year. This reflects sustained volume-driven growth across Amgen’s broad drug portfolio (with many products posting double-digit gains ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=3,trbw%29%2C%20KRYSTEXXA%5E%7B%C2%AE%7D%20%28pegloticase))), partly offset by continued erosion in mature products’ pricing (e.g. Enbrel). The anticipated biosimilar competition for key bone-health drugs (Prolia/Xgeva) is likely to impact the **second half** of 2025 rather than Q2 ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)) ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial/#:~:text=the%20fourth%20quarter%20and%208,erosion%20driven%20by%20biosimilar%20competition)), so Q2 should still show robust sales momentum.

**Profitability** in Q2 2025 is forecast to improve markedly versus the prior year. In Q2 2024, GAAP operating income was **$1.9 billion** (23.7% margin) ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=assets%20and%20incremental%20expenses%20from,2)), down from the previous year due to heavy amortization of newly acquired intangibles and other Horizon-related expenses. Those costs have now annualized, and Amgen has been realizing cost synergies and slower expense growth. We project **GAAP operating income** of about **$2.5 billion** for 2025 Q2, implying a healthier operating margin in the high-20s. Similarly, **EBITDA** (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) should rise significantly year-over-year given higher revenues and improved margins. (For reference, Amgen’s full-year 2024 EBITDA was $13.36 billion ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1347%20Depreciation%20and,13%2C356)), a ~40% margin, but Q2 2024 EBITDA was depressed by Horizon amortization and one-time costs.) We expect Q2 2025 EBITDA near **$3.5–3.6 billion**, reflecting margin expansion from cost discipline and the absence of last year’s one-time integration charges.

**Net income and EPS** are forecast to increase substantially in Q2 2025. GAAP EPS in Q2 2024 was only **$1.38** ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=including%20TEPEZZA%5E%7B%C2%AE%7D%20%28teprotumumab,97%2C%20driven%20by%20higher%20operating)), as amortization and acquisition expenses eroded profitability. By contrast, Q2 2025 will not bear comparable charges and will benefit from higher operating income. We estimate **GAAP net income** around **$1.35 billion**, yielding **EPS** of approximately **$2.50**. This nearly **80%** jump in EPS vs. the prior-year quarter is driven by core business growth and much lower expense drag. It’s worth noting that Amgen’s GAAP EPS can be volatile due to mark-to-market investment gains or losses (e.g. its stake in BeiGene); however, absent any major swings in Q2, the underlying earnings power should align with our forecast range. The share count is assumed roughly constant (~540 million diluted shares ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Free%20Cash%20Flow%20%20,5))).

Finally, we anticipate a **free cash flow (FCF)** improvement in Q2 2025. In Q2 2024, FCF was **$2.2 billion**, down from $3.8 billion a year earlier, because Amgen paid certain federal taxes in Q2 2024 that in 2023 were paid in Q4 ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=non,payments%20were%20made%20in%20Q2)). This timing issue hurt last year’s Q2 cash flow. In Q1 2025, Amgen already saw FCF rebound to $1.0 billion (versus $0.5 billion in Q1 2024) as a prior tax deposit did not recur ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=non,items%20and%20higher%20capital%20expenditures)). We expect **Q2 2025 free cash flow** of roughly **$2.5 billion**, assuming more normalized tax payment timing and the quarter’s stronger earnings. This outlook for FCF could vary if any tax payments deferred from 2024 land in Q2 2025, but overall the cash generation should be solid given higher profits and disciplined capital spending.

| Company    | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|-----------|------|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|

**Key Takeaways:** Amgen’s **2025 Q2** is expected to show healthy top-line growth and significantly higher profitability compared to the difficult quarter a year ago. Strong product demand (across cholesterol, oncology, inflammation, and rare disease therapies) and the waning of Horizon acquisition expenses should drive improvements in **revenue**, **operating income**, and **EPS**. Free cash flow is also projected to strengthen as one-off tax timing impacts normalize. These forecasts reflect public information up through July 22, 2025 and our analysis of Amgen’s trends and guidance, without reliance on any post-Q2 results. Overall, Amgen appears on track for a much stronger Q2 this year, supporting its full-year growth outlook ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202025%2C,the%20Company%20expects)) and continued investment in innovation.

# Microsoft 2025 Q2 Forecast (April–June 2025)

Microsoft’s financial momentum in early 2025 has been strong, driven by booming cloud services and AI demand. In the January–March 2025 quarter, Microsoft’s revenue reached $70.1 billion (up 13% year-over-year) with net income of $25.8 billion (up 18% YoY) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=In%20the%20January,44%20billion)). This growth was fueled by its cloud and AI businesses, which saw revenue of $26.8 billion (+21% YoY) in that quarter ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=year,productivity%2C%20cut%20costs%2C%20and%20grow)). Building on these trends and management’s guidance, we forecast robust results for the April–June 2025 period (Q2 2025). Key factors influencing our projections include:

- **Cloud & AI Growth:** Azure’s growth is accelerating. In the March quarter, Azure revenue grew 33% YoY, and management **forecast ~34%–35% growth for the upcoming quarter** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=Microsoft%20reported%20stronger,for%20the%20next%20quarter%2C%20led)). This suggests continued strong demand for cloud services. Indeed, Microsoft’s CFO guided Intelligent Cloud segment revenue of ~$28.8 billion (20%–22% YoY growth in constant currency) for Q2 ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=January%20price%20increase,in%20constant)). Commercial bookings (a forward-looking indicator) jumped 18% last quarter ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=forecast%20of%2034%25,contributed%20to%20growth%2C%20Azure%E2%80%99s%20performance)), indicating a healthy pipeline of future cloud business.

- **Productivity & Software:** The Productivity and Business Processes segment (Office, LinkedIn, Dynamics) is expected to sustain solid growth. Management projected this segment’s Q2 revenue at about $32.2 billion, up roughly 11%–12% YoY in constant currency ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=In%20Productivity%20and%20Business%20Processes,continued%20ARPU%20growth%20thru%20E5)). Steady Office 365 subscription gains and price increases are supporting revenue growth in the low teens, similar to last quarter’s trends.

- **Personal Computing Stabilizing:** The More Personal Computing segment (Windows, devices, search, and gaming) is forecast around $12.6 billion for the quarter ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=And%20in%20Enterprise%20and%20partner,We)). Windows OEM sales are likely to decline mid to high single digits (reflecting a still-recovering PC market), but this is offset by growth in other areas like search advertising (projected mid-teens growth) and Xbox content (mid-single-digit growth) ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=And%20in%20Enterprise%20and%20partner,We)). Overall, we expect this segment to be roughly flat year-over-year, neither a major drag nor boost to total revenue.

- **Margins & Profitability:** Despite massive investments in AI infrastructure, Microsoft’s cost management remains disciplined. Last quarter, operating income was $32.0 billion, up from $27.6 billion a year earlier ([www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/income-statements#:~:text=,%28971)) – an indication of strong operating leverage. For Q2, Microsoft guided cost of goods sold to rise ~19%–20% (due to cloud infrastructure depreciation) but operating expenses to increase only ~5% ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=Now%20back%20to%20company%20guidance,year%20FY25)). This suggests that **operating margins should stay robust**. We anticipate only a slight dip in operating margin versus the prior quarter due to revenue mix and higher depreciation. Net income is forecast to grow in line with operating profit. We assume an effective tax rate ~19% ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=match%20at%20L409%20And%20lastly%2C,signals%20we%20see%20for%20our)), yielding healthy net margins in the mid-30s%.

- **Cash Flow and Investments:** Microsoft’s capital expenditures have surged as it scales up data centers for AI. Capex in the March quarter jumped 53% YoY to $21.4 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ai-shift-bolsters-cloud-demand-2025-04-30/#:~:text=value.%20Commercial%20bookings%20grew%2018,lived%20assets%20like%20chips)), and similar heavy spending continued into Q2 (CapEx was **77% higher YoY in the June 2024 quarter** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-approves-new-60-billion-share-buyback-2024-09-16/#:~:text=this%20fiscal%20year%2C%20Microsoft%20indicated,Investors%20are%20pressuring%20tech)) and is increasing sequentially into this quarter ([mlq.ai](https://mlq.ai/stocks/4338.HK/earnings-call-transcript/Q3-2025#:~:text=And%20now%2C%20capital%20expenditures,Next%20to))). This **elevated CapEx will temper free cash flow** in the short term. Microsoft’s operating cash flow remains very strong (over $37 billion last quarter, thanks to growing cloud bookings and upfront payments), but we expect Q2 free cash flow to be somewhat lower than the prior quarter due to higher capital spending. The company’s ability to convert earnings to cash remains excellent, but year-over-year FCF growth will likely be muted or slightly down as these investments are funded.

Taking all these factors into account – double-digit revenue gains led by cloud, high profitability, and large ongoing investments – we project the following key metrics for Microsoft’s 2025 Q2 (quarter ending June 30, 2025). All figures are expressed as full dollar amounts (not in millions or billions):

| Company               | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA          | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow    | EPS   |
|-----------------------|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Microsoft Corporation | 2025 | 2       | 75,000,000,000  | 42,000,000,000  | 33,000,000,000   | 26,200,000,000  | 14,000,000,000   | 3.53  |

**Forecast Highlights:** We anticipate **revenue of about $75 billion** for Q2 2025, driven by continued Azure and cloud services strength, as well as solid growth in software and subscriptions. This represents a mid-teens percentage increase year-over-year (consistent with management’s segment outlook and slightly above their guidance range). **Operating income** is forecast around $33 billion, reflecting a strong ~44% operating margin. We expect **net income** near $26.2 billion, with EPS approximately **$3.53** (up from $3.46 in the prior quarter ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c9702a96b50e943b0ed48bca980630c#:~:text=In%20the%20January,44%20billion))). Finally, we project **free cash flow** on the order of $14 billion for the quarter – a sizable figure, though somewhat constrained by the stepped-up capital expenditures to support long-term cloud and AI growth. Overall, Microsoft is on track to deliver another quarter of robust growth in revenue and profits, balancing its aggressive investment in AI infrastructure with continued strong cash generation and profitability.

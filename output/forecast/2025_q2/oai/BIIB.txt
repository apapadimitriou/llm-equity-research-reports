# Biogen Inc. Q2 2025 Forecast Overview

As of mid-July 2025, Biogen’s business is in transition with new product launches offsetting declines in its legacy portfolio. In Q1 2025, Biogen’s revenue grew about 6% year-over-year to $2.43 billion ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biogen-q1-results-top-estimates-lowers-fy25-adj-eps-outlook#:~:text=per%20share%20for%20the%20quarter,estimates%20typically%20exclude%20special%20items)), driven by **rare disease drugs** (like Spinraza and the newly acquired Skyclarys) and **Alzheimer’s therapy Leqembi**, even as the **multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise declined** by 11% ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=pipeline,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)) ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=Alongside%20Skyclarys%2C%20Biogen%E2%80%99s%20rare%20disease,selling%20drug%20in%20Q1%202025)). We expect this trend to continue into Q2 2025. Biogen’s Q2 2024 revenue was $2.465 billion ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Q2%20%E2%80%9924%20Q2%20%E2%80%9923%20%E2%96%B3,%E2%80%94)), essentially flat from Q2 2023. For Q2 2025, we forecast a modest revenue increase as growth in new products slightly outweighs the erosion in MS drug sales. However, one-time expenses and ongoing investments are likely to pressure profitability in the quarter.

## Revenue Forecast

Biogen’s **MS product revenue** (e.g. **Tecfidera**, **Tysabri**) has been declining due to generics and competition (down 5% in Q2 2024 ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Multiple%20sclerosis%20,4)) and down 11% in Q1 2025 ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=pipeline,the%20same%20period%20last%20year))). We project MS revenues will fall by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year in Q2 2025. Conversely, the **rare disease portfolio** (Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy and Skyclarys for Friedreich’s ataxia) is growing robustly. In Q1 2025, Spinraza sales jumped to $423.9 million from $341.3 million the year prior ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=Alongside%20Skyclarys%2C%20Biogen%E2%80%99s%20rare%20disease,selling%20drug%20in%20Q1%202025)), and Skyclarys contributed $124 million ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=One%20of%20those%20assets%20is,due%20to%20Medicare%20discount%20dynamics)). We expect rare disease sales in Q2 2025 to continue double-digit growth from the $534 million level of Q2 2024 ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Multiple%20sclerosis%20,3)). 

Meanwhile, **Leqembi (Alzheimer’s drug)** is ramping up quickly. Global sales of Leqembi were $40 million in Q2 2024 ([www.biopharmadive.com](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-earnings-leqembi-sales-lilly-kisunla-alzheimers/723023/#:~:text=Sales%20of%20Biogen%E2%80%99s%20drug%2C%20Leqembi%2C,of%20information%2C%20according%20to%20Viehbacher)), rose to $67 million in Q3 2024 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/biogen-biib-earnings-q3-2024.html#:~:text=Still%2C%20uptake%20of%20Leqembi%20has,S)), and reached $96 million in Q1 2025 ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=Biogen%20splits%20revenue%20from%20Leqembi,EU)). Biogen splits these sales with partner Eisai, so Biogen’s Q2 2024 “contract/other” revenue of $121 million ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=%24534%20%24438%2022,1)) included roughly $20 million from Leqembi. By Q2 2025, we anticipate Leqembi’s contribution will be significantly higher (Eisai’s forecast was ~$360 million in Leqembi revenue for Apr 2024–Mar 2025 ([www.biopharmadive.com](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biogen-earnings-leqembi-sales-lilly-kisunla-alzheimers/723023/#:~:text=Biogen%E2%80%99s%20development%20partner%20Eisai%2C%20which,integrated%20healthcare%20systems%20adopt%20Leqembi))). We assume Biogen’s share of Leqembi in Q2 2025 roughly doubles year-over-year, helping **contract and royalty revenue** rebound. In addition, Biogen’s **biosimilars** segment (which had $198 million sales in Q2 2024 ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=%241%2C150%20%241%2C209%20%285%29,%2832))) should see mid-single-digit growth, as suggested by steady demand ([www.biospectrumasia.com](https://www.biospectrumasia.com/company-results/83/25587/biogen-reports-q4-and-full-year-2024-results-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges.html#:~:text=patient%20base%20since%20the%20end,of%202023)).

Taking these factors together, our **Q2 2025 revenue forecast is slightly above Q2 2024’s $2.465 billion** ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Q2%20%E2%80%9924%20Q2%20%E2%80%9923%20%E2%96%B3,%E2%80%94)). Growth in **rare disease and new products** is expected to offset declines in MS and mature products, yielding an estimated **$2.48 billion** for Q2 2025. This represents roughly flat to low-single-digit percentage growth year-over-year.

## EBITDA and Operating Income Forecast

We project **EBITDA** and **operating income** will be **lower** in Q2 2025 compared to the prior year, despite roughly stable revenue. Biogen improved its operating margins in 2024 through cost-cutting (e.g. the “Fit for Growth” program) ([www.biospectrumasia.com](https://www.biospectrumasia.com/company-results/83/25587/biogen-reports-q4-and-full-year-2024-results-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges.html#:~:text=Biogen%E2%80%99s%20key%20expense%20analysis%20for,certain%20segments%20faced%20competitive%20pressures)) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=match%20at%20L245%20,SG%26A%20includes%20higher%20operational%20spending)). However, in 2025 the company is reinvesting in R&D and product launches. In particular, Biogen paid a **$165 million upfront licensing fee to Stoke Therapeutics** in Q2 2025 (for an ASO therapy collaboration), which management flagged as impacting 2025 earnings ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biogen-q1-results-top-estimates-lowers-fy25-adj-eps-outlook#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%20to%20fiscal%202025%2C,and%20more%20favorable%20foreign%20exchange)). We expect this **one-time R&D expense** to reduce Q2 operating profit by about $165 million versus the prior year.

In Q2 2024, Biogen’s GAAP operating margin was around *28%* (GAAP diluted EPS was $4.00 ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Q2%20%E2%80%9924%20Q2%20%E2%80%9923%20%E2%96%B3,%E2%80%94)), implying roughly $584 million net income and higher operating income before tax). By contrast, Q2 2025 operating costs will rise due to the Stoke payment and ongoing commercial investments (e.g. **Leqembi launch costs, new rare disease sales teams**), partially offset by continued savings from cost-cutting initiatives ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=,SG%26A%20includes%20higher%20operational%20spending)). We therefore forecast **operating income of approximately $530 million** in Q2 2025. Adding back depreciation and amortization (Biogen has significant amortization of acquired intangibles from deals like the $7.3B Reata acquisition ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=time))), we estimate **EBITDA around $700 million** for the quarter. This reflects a mid-20s EBITDA margin, slightly lower than the prior year due to the R&D charge.

## Net Income and EPS Forecast

Biogen’s GAAP **net income and EPS** in Q2 2025 are expected to drop versus last year’s levels. In Q2 2024, Biogen reported GAAP net income of roughly $584 million (GAAP EPS of **$4.00** ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Q2%20%E2%80%9924%20Q2%20%E2%80%9923%20%E2%96%B3,%E2%80%94))). Given our anticipated lower operating profit and similar tax rate (~15% effective tax in 2024 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=match%20at%20L275%20,and%2014.6))), we forecast Q2 2025 **net income around $420 million**. This yields an **EPS** forecast of approximately **$2.85** per share for Q2 2025, using about 146–147 million diluted shares (consistent with recent quarters ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biogen-q1-results-top-estimates-lowers-fy25-adj-eps-outlook#:~:text=%28RTTNews%29%20,year%20quarter))). The decline in EPS year-over-year is mainly due to the one-off R&D expense and ongoing MS revenue erosion. Excluding the Stoke deal cost, Biogen’s underlying earnings would likely be closer to flat, as new product contributions help stabilize operating profits. Nevertheless, **GAAP EPS is projected to be ~30% lower** than Q2 2024’s $4.00 ([www.1stoncology.com](https://www.1stoncology.com/blog/biogen-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-resultsraises-full-year-2024-financial-guidance-second-quarter-2024-total-revenue-of-2-5-billion-gaap-diluted-eps-of-4-00non-gaap-diluted-eps-of-5-28123464524/#:~:text=Q2%20%E2%80%9924%20Q2%20%E2%80%9923%20%E2%96%B3,%E2%80%94)).

It’s worth noting that Biogen’s **non-GAAP (adjusted)** EPS trends may show a different pattern. The company’s adjusted EPS excludes certain items like amortization and investment gains/losses. Biogen’s full-year 2025 guidance (issued in February) was $15.25–$16.25 non-GAAP EPS ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=Full%20year%202025%20financial%20guidance%3A,25)), later revised down to $14.50–$15.50 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biogen-q1-results-top-estimates-lowers-fy25-adj-eps-outlook#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%20to%20fiscal%202025%2C,and%20more%20favorable%20foreign%20exchange)) after accounting for the Stoke deal. Our GAAP EPS forecast of ~$2.85 for Q2 suggests that, on an adjusted basis, Biogen could still be on track for its full-year target once one-time costs are normalized. 

## Free Cash Flow Forecast

We expect Biogen to continue generating healthy **free cash flow (FCF)** in Q2 2025, albeit slightly lower than the prior year. In Q2 2024, Biogen’s net cash from operations was **$626 million** and FCF was **$592 million** after $34 million of capital expenditures ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875045/000087504524000022/exhibit991-q22024pressrele.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Second%20quarter%202024%20net%20cash,less%20capital%20expenditures%2C%20was%20%24592%C2%A0million)). In Q2 2025, cash flow will be impacted by the $165 million collaboration payment (a cash R&D outflow) and potentially by working capital needs for new product launches (e.g. building Leqembi inventory and receivables). Offsetting this, Biogen’s core operations remain highly cash-generative with strong margins. We forecast **operating cash flow around $550–$570 million** and **capital expenditures around $40 million** for the quarter. This results in an estimated **free cash flow of roughly $510–$530 million** for Q2 2025. Our projection of about **$520 million FCF** represents a moderate decline from the $592 million in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875045/000087504524000022/exhibit991-q22024pressrele.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Second%20quarter%202024%20net%20cash,less%20capital%20expenditures%2C%20was%20%24592%C2%A0million)), aligning with the expected dip in quarterly earnings. Biogen’s solid FCF will continue to support its strategic investments and shareholder returns (the company historically has used cash for share buybacks and acquisitions).

Finally, we summarize our Q2 2025 forecasts for Biogen Inc. in the table below:

| Company      | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS   |
|-------------|------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Biogen Inc. | 2025 | 2       | 2,480,000,000  | 700,000,000   | 530,000,000      | 420,000,000  | 520,000,000    | 2.85  |

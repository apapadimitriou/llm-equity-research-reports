## PNC Financial Services Group 2025-Q2 Forecast

**Overview:** PNC entered 2025 with strong momentum, reporting solid Q1 results and expressing optimism for the year. Management expects *“record net interest income and solid positive operating leverage in 2025”* ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=activity%2C%20expenses%20remained%20well,positive%20operating%20leverage%20in%202025)). The high interest-rate environment and continued loan growth are forecast to lift net interest income (NII) in Q2, while noninterest revenue sees a modest rebound from seasonal softness in Q1. Expenses are projected to remain *“stable”* ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20revenue%20to%20be%20up,to%203)), supporting positive operating leverage as revenue rises faster than costs. Credit quality remains sound, but provision for credit losses is anticipated to be somewhat higher year-over-year given macroeconomic factors. Below is our forecast for PNC’s 2025 Q2 financials, based on management guidance and recent trends:

- **Revenue:** We project revenue of about $5.6 billion, up roughly 2% quarter-over-quarter and ~5% year-over-year. This is driven by a 1–2% increase in NII (helped by **one extra day** in Q2 and slight net interest margin expansion) and a 1–3% uptick in fee income ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Average%20loans%20to%20be%20up,approximately%201)) as capital markets and treasury management fees recover from Q1’s seasonal dip. Other noninterest income is assumed around the mid-point of guidance ($150–$200 million) ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Other%20noninterest%20income%20to%20be,150%20million%20to%20%24200%20million)), reflecting more normalized Visa-related gains/losses after Q1’s negative adjustment. These factors combine for a mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth, consistent with PNC’s target of *“total revenue up 1% to 3%”* sequentially ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Other%20noninterest%20income%20to%20be,150%20million%20to%20%24200%20million)).

- **EBITDA:** In banking terms, we consider pretax pre-provision earnings plus depreciation as a proxy. We expect **EBITDA** around $2.3–$2.4 billion. This reflects higher NII (aided by continued fixed-rate asset re-pricing and easing funding costs) ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=Income%20Statement%20%E2%96%AA%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Net%20interest,slowdown%20in%20capital%20markets%20activity)) and steady fee income versus Q1, against roughly flat operating expenses. PNC’s net interest margin likely ticked up slightly from Q1’s 2.78% ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=driven%20by%20two%20fewer%20days,Other%20noninterest%20income%20of%20%24137)) toward ~2.80%, given management’s outlook for ongoing margin expansion and loan growth. Robust cost discipline means *“noninterest expense to be stable”* ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20revenue%20to%20be%20up,to%203)), so most incremental revenue should translate into EBITDA growth.  

- **Operating Income:** We forecast **operating income (pre-tax)** near $1.95 billion for Q2. This is higher than Q1’s $1.846 billion ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=Provision%20for%20credit%20losses%20,)) due to revenue gains and flat expenses, partially offset by a higher loan loss provision. PNC guided net charge-offs of around **$300 million** ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-021752/pnc-20250331.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20revenue%20to%20be%20up,to%203)) (vs. $205 million in Q1), implying a similar level for provision expense. Even with this prudent reserve build for potential credit stress, PNC should generate double-digit growth in pre-tax income year-over-year. The bank generated positive operating leverage in Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-of-1-5-billion-3-39-diluted-eps-302197955.html#:~:text=Noninterest%20expense%20%20,754%20million%20substantially%20offset%20by)), and we anticipate a similar dynamic in Q2 2025 given management’s focus on expense control and revenue growth.

- **Net Income:** After taxes (~19% effective rate, in line with recent quarters ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-of-1-5-billion-3-39-diluted-eps-302197955.html#:~:text=,the%20second%20and%20first%20quarter)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-6-billion-3-85-diluted-eps-302506673.html#:~:text=by%20lower%20private%20equity%20revenue,second%20quarter%20and%20first%20quarter))) and preferred dividends, **net income** is projected around $1.58 billion. This represents an increase from $1.477 billion a year ago ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-of-1-5-billion-3-39-diluted-eps-302197955.html#:~:text=Provision%20for%20credit%20losses%20,)), reflecting higher NII and fee revenue. Credit costs are higher than the unusually low levels of early 2024, but credit quality remains *“stable”* with strong reserves and only a modest uptick in charge-offs ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-6-billion-3-85-diluted-eps-302506673.html#:~:text=%E2%96%AA%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Average%20deposits%20grew%20%242,%E2%96%AA%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Maintained%20strong%20capital%20position)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-6-billion-3-85-diluted-eps-302506673.html#:~:text=Accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income%20,%7C%2012.16)). PNC’s return on equity is expected to stay healthy (~12%), benefiting from share repurchases in Q1–Q2 and the improved earnings. 

- **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** We estimate **FCF** (approximated as cash earnings minus capital expenditures) at roughly $1.6 billion for the quarter. Banks’ free cash flow is not as straightforward due to working capital (loan/deposit) swings, but PNC’s core cash generation is strong. Net income plus non-cash charges (e.g. ~$150 million in depreciation) provides over $1.7 billion of operating cash. After funding any capital projects (branch investments, technology upgrades, etc.), PNC should still produce around $1.6 billion available for dividends and buybacks. In fact, PNC returned about $0.8 billion to shareholders in Q1 through dividends and repurchases ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=,March%2031%2C%202025%20was%20108)), and it announced a higher dividend of $1.70 per share for Q3 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-6-billion-3-85-diluted-eps-302506673.html#:~:text=Strong%20loan%20growth%3B%204,operating%20leverage%3B%20stable%20credit%20quality)), underscoring confidence in cash generation.

- **EPS:** We forecast **EPS** of approximately **$3.75** for Q2. This is up from $3.39 in 2Q24 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pnc-reports-second-quarter-2024-net-income-of-1-5-billion-3-39-diluted-eps-302197955.html#:~:text=,36)), driven by higher net income and a slight reduction in shares outstanding. PNC’s ongoing buyback program (about $0.2 billion repurchased in Q1 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=,March%2031%2C%202025%20was%20108)), with similar levels expected in Q2) has trimmed the share count, amplifying EPS growth. Our EPS estimate implies roughly 20% sequential growth over Q1’s $3.51 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/655/pnc-reports-first-quarter-2025-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=,10)), which aligns with the anticipated earnings rebound from Q1’s seasonal lows and aligns with the upper single-digit to low double-digit year-over-year EPS increase.

# Recent Performance and Baseline Trends

**Meta’s Q2 2024 Results:** Meta Platforms had a strong second quarter in 2024, with revenue of $39.07 billion (up 22% year-over-year) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increased%20by%2010%25%20year,47%20billion)). Cost discipline and rebounding advertising demand drove a sharp increase in profitability: operating income was $14.85 billion (a 58% jump vs. Q2 2023) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%201%2C641)), and net income reached $13.47 billion – a 73% increase year-over-year ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=%7C%2016%C2%A0,73)). This translated to diluted EPS of $5.16 for Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=%7C%2016%C2%A0,73)). The strong results were powered by **ad volume and pricing** improvements, as ad impressions grew 10% and the average price per ad rose 10% in that quarter ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=,22%20billion%2C%20an)). Free cash flow in Q2 2024 was solid at $10.90 billion ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increase%20of%207%25%20year,90%20billion)), even as capital expenditures rose to $8.47 billion in the quarter ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increase%20of%207%25%20year,90%20billion)).

**Meta’s Q1 2025 Momentum:** The company carried positive momentum into 2025. In Q1 2025, Meta’s revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $42.31 billion ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=Meta%20reported%20revenue%20of%20%2442,to%20data%20compiled%20by%20LSEG)). Advertising demand remained robust – **average ad prices** were 10% higher than a year prior, offsetting a more modest 5% growth in ad impressions ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,year)). Meta’s extensive cost reduction efforts in 2023 (including layoffs) and ongoing efficiency focus led to **improved margins**. Q1 2025 operating income was $17.56 billion (41% margin vs. 38% a year earlier) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=%7C%209%C2%A0,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%201%2C814)), up 27% year-on-year. Net income jumped 35% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, with diluted EPS of $6.43 ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,43)). This outsized earnings growth reflects both revenue gains and slower expense growth (Q1 costs rose just 9% YoY) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,27)) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Costs%20and%20expenses%20%20,%7C)). The company’s heavy share repurchases (e.g. $13.4 billion bought back in Q1 2025) have also reduced the share count, boosting EPS growth ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,securities%20%E2%80%93%20Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents)).  

However, **free cash flow** in Q1 2025 declined to $10.33 billion from $12.53 billion in Q1 2024 ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=from%20operating%20activities%20was%20%2424,2025%2C%20an%20increase%20of%2011)) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%2012%2C531)). This drop was due to a sharp rise in capital expenditures as Meta invests in AI-related infrastructure. Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditure budget to **$64–72 billion** (from a prior $60–65 billion) to accelerate data center buildout for AI and its core apps ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=Shares%20of%20the%20company%20were,in%20extended%20trading)) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx?os=___&ref=app#:~:text=We%20anticipate%20our%20full%20year,2025%20will%20continue%20to%20be)). Higher capex is weighing on free cash generation in the short term.

# Q2 2025 Outlook and Assumptions

**Revenue Growth Expectations:** For Q2 2025, Meta’s management guided revenue in a range of **$42.5–45.5 billion** ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=We%20expect%20second%20quarter%202025,based%20on%20current%20exchange%20rates)). This implies continued double-digit growth (~9% to 16% YoY increase from the $39.07 billion in Q2 2024). Management noted a modest 1% foreign exchange tailwind to growth in Q2 ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=We%20expect%20second%20quarter%202025,based%20on%20current%20exchange%20rates)). We anticipate Meta will land **toward the upper half of this range**, given the strong Q1 performance and ongoing improvements in monetization. Continued strength in ad pricing and steady user engagement should drive a healthy year-over-year revenue gain. In Q1 2025 Meta’s ad pricing was up 10% ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,year)) – we expect a similar trend in Q2 as advertisers benefit from Meta’s AI-enhanced targeting and conversion tools. Ad impression growth may remain mid-single-digit (reflecting high user penetration and time spent), but **combined with pricing** it should yield low-to-mid teens percentage revenue growth. 

External factors present some risk: Meta’s CFO cautioned that economic uncertainty makes forecasting challenging ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=billion%2C%20compared%20with%20an%20average,01%20billion)). Indeed, a smaller rival, Snap, withheld formal Q2 guidance citing macro-economic uncertainty and regulatory changes impacting ads ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=match%20at%20L88%20A%20day,business%2C%C2%A0causing%20its%20shares%20to%20crater)). Nonetheless, Meta’s broad advertiser base and investments in AI-driven recommendations likely help it **outperform smaller peers**. Considering these factors, our Q2 2025 revenue forecast is **near the high end of guidance**, implying approximately mid-teens percentage growth year-over-year.

**Profitability and Margin:** We project **operating income** will rise significantly in Q2 2025 on the back of higher revenue and moderate expense growth. Meta has kept a tight rein on costs – the company actually **lowered its full-year 2025 expense outlook** to $113–118 billion (from $114–119 billion) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=We%20expect%20full%20year%202025,119%20billion)), reflecting efficiency gains. In Q2 2024, total costs grew only 7% YoY ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=,27%20billion)); we assume Q2 2025 expenses continue to grow at a high-single-digit percentage rate. This means costs in Q2 2025 will likely be around ~$26–27 billion (versus $24.22 billion in Q2 2024) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=,27%20billion)). With revenue expanding faster than costs, **operating margin** should improve slightly from the 38% margin of Q2 last year ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=%7C%2058%C2%A0,)). We expect an operating margin in the ~40–41% range for Q2 2025, similar to Q1’s level, yielding robust operating profit growth.

For **EBITDA**, we add back depreciation and amortization to operating income. Depreciation has been rising as Meta’s capital investments from prior years come online (Q1 2025 D&A was $3.90 billion vs $3.37 billion in Q1 2024) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,3%2C562)). We project Q2 2025 D&A around $4.2 billion (up from $3.64 billion in Q2 2024) ([investor.fb.com](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?_bhlid=ff7dab54409eb3386597a9fb60bea50cb7f1ae93#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,5%2C147)). This leads to a healthy increase in EBITDA year-over-year, reflecting the higher operating income plus added non-cash expense.

**Net Income and EPS:** Meta’s pre-tax profits will also benefit from increased interest income on its large cash reserves, partially offsetting any rising costs. In Q1, Meta’s other income (mostly interest) was about $0.8 billion, which boosted net income ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=%7C%209%C2%A0,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%201%2C814)) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,43)). We assume a similar contribution in Q2. Meta’s effective tax rate was 11% in Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=Provision%20for%20income%20taxes%20,73)) and around 13% in Q1 2025 ([investor.fb.com](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?ref=upstract.com#:~:text=Effective%20tax%20rate%20%20,)). For Q2 2025 we use a tax rate near the mid-teens (management guided 12–15% for the full year) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=match%20at%20L91%20Absent%20any,15)). The result is a **net income** forecast in the mid-$16 billion range – a substantial increase from $13.47 billion a year ago ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=%7C%2016%C2%A0,73)). 

Earnings per share will be enhanced by Meta’s aggressive buybacks. With the company repurchasing shares (over $13 billion in Q1 alone) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,securities%20%E2%80%93%20Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents)), the diluted share count keeps shrinking. We estimate the average diluted shares outstanding in Q2 2025 will be a few percent lower than a year prior, amplifying the EPS growth. Our net income projection translates to **EPS in the mid-$6 range**, up from $5.16 in Q2 last year ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=%7C%2016%C2%A0,73)). This reflects strong double-digit growth in earnings driven by both higher revenue and higher margins.

**Free Cash Flow:** We anticipate **free cash flow (FCF)** will come in lower than the prior year, given Meta’s ramped-up capital spending. In Q2 2024, FCF was $10.90 billion ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increase%20of%207%25%20year,90%20billion)). Since then, Meta has dramatically increased its capital expenditures to fuel AI infrastructure. In Q1 2025, FCF was down ~17% year-over-year despite higher profits, because capex more than doubled (capex was $13.7 billion in Q1 2025 vs ~$6.7 billion in Q1 2024) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=from%20operating%20activities%20was%20%2424,2025%2C%20an%20increase%20of%2011)) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%2012%2C531)). We expect a similar trend in Q2. Meta’s own outlook indicates 2025 capex will **far exceed 2024 levels** ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=Shares%20of%20the%20company%20were,in%20extended%20trading)). Q2 2025 capital expenditures will likely be on the order of ~$14 billion or more (versus $8.47 billion in Q2 2024) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increase%20of%207%25%20year,90%20billion)). Operating cash flow should rise on higher earnings, but not enough to fully offset the capex surge. Therefore, we project Q2 2025 FCF will decline year-on-year, ending up around the high single-digit billions of dollars. This still represents healthy cash generation, but lower than the prior-year quarter due to Meta’s heavy reinvestment in growth.

# Forecast Summary for Meta Platforms – 2025 Q2

The table below summarizes our forecasts for Meta Platforms in **2025 Q2**. All figures are forecasts for the quarter (three months ending June 30, 2025), expressed in full dollar amounts (not in millions or billions):

| Company        | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA          | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow  | EPS   |
|---------------|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Meta Platforms | 2025 | 2       | 45,000,000,000  | 22,700,000,000  | 18,500,000,000   | 16,500,000,000  | 9,000,000,000   | 6.40  |

**Key drivers:** This forecast reflects **~15% YoY revenue growth** (to ~$45 billion) driven by higher ad prices and steady user engagement ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,year)), with operating expenses rising at a slower pace (~9–10% YoY) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=,27%20billion)). As a result, we expect operating and net income to increase by over 20% compared to Q2 2024. EBITDA growth is similarly robust after adding back approximately $4+ billion of depreciation. Diluted EPS is projected at about $6.40 for Q2 2025, boosted by the higher earnings and share buybacks. Free cash flow is forecast around $9 billion for the quarter, somewhat lower than a year ago ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211512.html#:~:text=increase%20of%207%25%20year,90%20billion)) due to significantly greater capital expenditure investments ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-beats-estimates-for-firstquarter-revenue-4014515#:~:text=Shares%20of%20the%20company%20were,in%20extended%20trading)). Overall, Meta is poised for a strong quarter of revenue and profit growth, while strategically reinvesting cash into its technological infrastructure for long-term expansion.

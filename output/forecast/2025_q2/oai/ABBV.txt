# AbbVie Inc. – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

**Overview:** AbbVie is navigating the loss of exclusivity for its flagship drug Humira by leveraging strong growth in newer products ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/abbvie-forecasts-2025-profit-above-estimates-driven-by-newer-immunology-drugs-2025-01-31/#:~:text=AbbVie%20has%20projected%20higher,noted%20that%20the%20company%20expects)). Management has expressed confidence that 2025 revenues will exceed prior peak levels (pre-Humira LOE) given the momentum of its diversified portfolio ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-01-31-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=approvals%20and%20promising%20data%2C%20and,Humira%20loss%20of%20exclusivity)). Our Q2 2025 forecast reflects modest top-line growth driven by immunology and neuroscience franchises, stable operating margins, and improved cash flow generation as one-time expenses normalize.

## Revenue Forecast (Q2 2025)  
We project **Q2 2025 revenue of ~$15.2 billion**, a mid-single-digit increase from the $14.462 billion reported in Q2 2024 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Delivers%20Second,Percent%20on%20an%20Operational%20Basis)). This growth is fueled by robust sales of **Skyrizi** and **Rinvoq** – AbbVie’s newer immunology drugs – which are more than offsetting Humira’s decline ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,percent%20on%20an%20operational%20basis)). In Q1 2025, **Skyrizi** revenue jumped 70% YoY to $3.43 B and **Rinvoq** rose 57% to $1.72 B ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,percent%20on%20an%20operational%20basis)), while **Humira** fell ~50% due to biosimilars ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=match%20at%20L67%20,percent%20on%20an%20operational%20basis)). We expect a similar dynamic in Q2, with continued double-digit growth in Skyrizi/Rinvoq and positive contributions from neuroscience (e.g. Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic) and oncology (including new product **Elahere**) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,282%20billion%2C%20an)) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,9)). The **Aesthetics** segment (Allergan’s Botox Cosmetic, Juvederm) likely remains roughly flat to slightly up, as AbbVie indicated an improving outlook for that business from 2025 onward ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-01-31-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=,Rate%20from%202025%20through%202029)). Overall, strong new product uptake and operational momentum (8.4% YoY total sales gain in Q1 2025) support our revenue growth assumption for Q2 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Delivers%20First,Percent%20on%20an%20Operational%20Basis)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/abbvie-lifts-profit-forecast-strong-sales-newer-immunology-drugs-2025-04-25/#:~:text=quarter%20sales%20of%20its%20newer,hundreds%20of%20millions%20of%20dollars)).

## EBITDA & Operating Income  
We forecast **EBITDA of approximately $6.5 billion** for Q2 2025, reflecting steady margins on higher sales. In Q2 2024, AbbVie’s GAAP operating earnings were $3.998 billion ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=,959)). After adding back non-cash charges – notably ~$1.95 billion of **intangible asset amortization** in that quarter ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=Intangible%20asset%20amortization%20%20,145)) – the **underlying EBITDA exceeded $6.0 billion**. For Q2 2025, we anticipate a slightly higher operating profit of about **$4.3 billion**, as revenue growth and efficiencies offset Humira’s higher-margin mix loss. AbbVie’s **gross margin** remains strong (70% on a GAAP basis in Q1 2025) and SG&A/R&D expense ratios are being held in check ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,The)). Intangible amortization will still weigh on GAAP operating income (~$2.0 B similar to Q2 2024) but is excluded in our EBITDA figure ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=Intangible%20asset%20amortization%20%20,145)). On balance, we expect **operating income** to rise modestly year-on-year and EBITDA to expand to around **$6.5 B**, maintaining an EBITDA margin in the low-40s percentage range.

## Net Income & EPS  
AbbVie’s GAAP earnings are suppressed by large amortization and one-time charges, but we see improvement in Q2 2025. In Q2 2024 GAAP **net income** was only $1.37 B (EPS $0.77) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=Income%20tax%20expense%20%20,3)) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=Diluted%20earnings%20per%20share%20attributable,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%201.26)), due to heavy **acquired R&D and milestone expenses** (~$0.52 per share impact) and contingent liability adjustments that quarter ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Reports%20Second,Acquired%20IPR%26D%20and%20Milestones%20Expense)). For Q2 2025, we assume **fewer one-time charges** – AbbVie’s Q1 2025 incurred $248 MM in milestone R&D expense ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,9%2C512%20Operating%20earnings)) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=Acquired%20IPR%26D%20and%20milestones%20,2%2C798)), but no similar large Q2 charge is known as of mid-July. This should result in higher reported earnings. We forecast **GAAP net income around $1.8 B** for Q2 2025, which yields **EPS of roughly $0.95** (vs. $0.77 in Q2 last year) based on ~1.77 B shares. Key factors are the increased operating profit and slightly lower **interest expense** coverage (interest costs rose in early 2025 with higher debt and rates ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,586))). It’s worth noting that excluding non-cash amortization and special items, AbbVie’s **adjusted EPS** is much higher – e.g. $2.65 in Q2 2024 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-07-25-AbbVie-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results#:~:text=Diluted%20earnings%20per%20share%20attributable,%24%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%205.37)) – but our $0.95 EPS forecast is for GAAP EPS, anticipating a lighter drag from one-time expenses this quarter.

## Free Cash Flow  
We expect AbbVie’s **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** to rebound in Q2 2025 to about **$4.5 billion**. AbbVie consistently converts a large portion of its earnings to cash – for context, annual free cash flow was $22.1 B in 2023 and $17.8 B in 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/free-cash-flow#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)). The dip in 2024 FCF reflected Humira’s profit decline and higher milestone payouts. In Q1 2025, operating cash flow dropped ~60% YoY (to $1.64 B) due to seasonal working capital and one-time outflows ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/cash-flow-from-operating-activities#:~:text=,decline%20from%202022)), but we anticipate a **strong recovery in Q2** as those effects normalize. Non-cash expenses like amortization (roughly $2 B quarterly) will boost operating cash flow relative to GAAP net income, and capital expenditures remain modest (around $1 B per year) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/cash-flow-capital-expenditure/ABBV#:~:text=,What%20is%20AbbVie)). Therefore, with Q2 earnings improving and less cash tied up in working capital, we project FCF in the mid-single-digit billions. This **~$4.5 B FCF** forecast for Q2 2025 underscores AbbVie’s robust cash-generating ability, providing ample capacity to fund dividends, debt repayment, and pipeline investments.

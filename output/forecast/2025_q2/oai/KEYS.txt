# Keysight Technologies 2025-Q2 Forecast

## Revenue Outlook for Q2 2025  
Keysight’s revenue is expected to **increase mid-single digits year-over-year** in fiscal Q2 2025. The company returned to growth in Q1 2025 with $1.30 billion in revenue (up from $1.26 billion in Q1 2024) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=First%20Quarter%20Financial%20Summary)), signaling a *“gradual recovery in 2025”* amid improving demand ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=our%20view%20of%20a%20gradual,term%20value)). For Q2, management guided revenue between **$1.27–$1.29 billion** ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Outlook)), which would be ~5% above the $1.22 billion achieved in Q2 2024 ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Second%20Quarter%20Financial%20Summary)). Given that **Q1 results came in above the high end of guidance** ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Q1%20results%20above%20high%20end,pipeline%20drives%20return%20to%20growth)), we project Q2 revenue near the upper end of the range, around **$1.30 billion**. This growth will likely be driven by the **Communications Solutions Group (CSG)** segment, buoyed by 5G and aerospace/defense demand. CSG revenue is anticipated to rise by high-single-digit percentages year-on-year ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=)). Meanwhile, the **Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG)** segment should see a modest uptick (low- to mid-single-digit growth), as improving semiconductor and general electronics demand offset weakness in automotive markets ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,EISG)). Overall, a healthier order funnel and stable macro environment support a **~6–7% YOY revenue increase** for Q2 2025, to roughly **$1.30 billion**.

## EBITDA & Operating Income  
We expect **operating profitability to improve significantly** in Q2 2025 versus the prior year. In Q2 2024, Keysight’s revenue decline and acquisition-related costs compressed margins – GAAP operating income was only $177 million on $1.216 billion revenue (≈14.5% operating margin) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=,14)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=Income%20before%20taxes%20%20,692)). Since then, Keysight has streamlined costs (selling/general expense was flat year-over-year in Q1) and absorbed one-time integration charges from a major 2024 acquisition. With Q2 2025 revenue rebounding, **we forecast GAAP operating income around $200 million** (mid-15% margin), reflecting better fixed-cost leverage and slightly lower intangible amortization. Notably, Q2 2024 included about **$37 million of acquisition-related amortization** (about $0.21 per share) and other one-time costs ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=Amortization%20of%20acquisition,0.47)) that won’t weigh as heavily this year. Adding back depreciation and amortization, **EBITDA is projected near $270 million** for Q2 2025. This implies an EBITDA margin of roughly 21%, up from the prior-year quarter (when EBITDA was ~$245 million, ~20% margin). Overall, stronger sales and stable R&D/SG&A expenses should **lift both operating income and EBITDA** versus last year’s subdued levels.

## Net Income & EPS  
**Net earnings are expected to rebound strongly** in Q2 2025. The year-ago quarter saw GAAP net income plunge to $126 million (EPS $0.72) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)), as Keysight absorbed integration costs and higher amortization from acquisitions. By contrast, Q2 2025 should benefit from revenue growth and improved margins, as well as a lower share count. **Excluding any unusual gains or losses**, we project **net income around $170 million**, roughly **35% higher** than Q2 last year. This equates to approximately **$1.00 in GAAP earnings per share**, assuming ~173–174 million diluted shares. Keysight’s effective tax rate is fairly low (the company uses ~14% for non-GAAP estimates) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Outlook)), so most operating profit gains should flow to the bottom line. It’s worth noting that last year’s Q2 profit was unusually weak not only year-over-year but even compared to Q2 2023 (when net income was $283 million) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)). The forecasted ~$170 million net income in Q2 2025 represents a recovery toward a more normal earnings level, though **still below all-time highs**. We emphasize that this EPS outlook assumes no major one-time items – Keysight’s results can occasionally be influenced by non-operational gains (e.g. investment fair-value gains) or charges, but absent those, **EPS should land around $0.95–$1.00** for the quarter.

## Free Cash Flow  
**Free cash flow (FCF)** is expected to **surge in Q2 2025** versus the prior year’s period. In Q2 2024, FCF fell to just **$74 million** ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=,66%20billion)) (down from $370 million in Q2 2023), due in part to a large working-capital swing and acquisition/integration payments that quarter. This was an anomaly, as Keysight’s cash generation is typically much stronger – for instance, **Q1 2025 FCF was $346 million, up from $281 million in Q1 2024** ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,06%20billion)). We anticipate a **return to robust cash generation in Q2 2025**, thanks to higher earnings and normalization of cash timing. Customer demand stabilization means less need to build inventory, and receivables collections from the Q1 sales uptick should boost operating cash flow. Keysight also tends to see lower employee bonus and payroll outflows after Q1, further helping Q2 cash. Given these factors, **our forecast calls for around $400 million in free cash flow** for Q2 2025. This would be a dramatic improvement from last year’s trough, and roughly in line with the FCF levels Keysight achieved in healthier market conditions (for example, Q2 2023’s FCF was $370 million) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx?activity_id=4444584#:~:text=,66%20billion)). In short, **we expect Keysight to convert a large portion of its Q2 profits into free cash** as working-capital headwinds abate.

# S&P Global (SPGI) – Q2 2025 Forecast and Analysis

## Revenue Forecast (2025 Q2)  
S&P Global’s revenue for Q2 2025 is projected at **$3,730,000,000**, reflecting roughly 5% growth year-over-year. This moderate increase is in line with management’s full-year 2025 revenue growth guidance of 4%–6% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=,%2417.25)). In the prior year Q2 2024, S&P Global achieved revenue of $3.55 billion (a 14% YoY jump) amid robust demand for ratings and data services ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-raises-annual-profit-forecast-demand-analytics-products-2024-07-30/#:~:text=year%2C%20up%20from%20the%20previous,12%20per%20share%2C%20the)). Given the strong first-quarter 2025 performance (8% YoY revenue growth to $3.777 billion) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20reported%20first,to%20%244.37)), we anticipate continued growth in Q2 2025 driven by steady demand across its divisions. The Ratings segment, in particular, is expected to contribute meaningfully – although Q2 2024 set a high base (Ratings revenue was $1.14 billion in that quarter) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-raises-annual-profit-forecast-demand-analytics-products-2024-07-30/#:~:text=year%2C%20up%20from%20the%20previous,12%20per%20share%2C%20the)), debt issuance activity in mid-2025 should remain solid. Other segments like Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights are likely to see mid-single-digit percentage gains, consistent with recent trends ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-lifts-annual-profit-forecast-demand-analytics-products-2024-10-24/#:~:text=revenue%20of%20its%20market%20intelligence,recently%20agreed%20to%20pay%20%2420)). This forecast assumes no major economic disruptions and reflects S&P Global’s essential role in volatile markets, where demand for its data and analytics remains strong ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-global-first-quarter-profit-beats-estimates-strong-product-demand-2024-04-25/#:~:text=2024,increase%20in%20revenue%2C%20reaching)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-forecasts-annual-profit-above-estimates-strong-demand-its-offerings-2025-02-11/#:~:text=increase%20in%20revenue%20across%20its,48%20per%20share)).

## EBITDA & Operating Income Forecast  
We forecast **EBITDA of approximately $1,890,000,000** for Q2 2025. This is derived from an expected **Operating Income of about $1,550,000,000** and adding back roughly $340 million in depreciation and amortization. In Q2 2024, S&P Global’s GAAP operating profit margin was 40.9% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20second%20quarter%20reported,primarily%20due%20to)) – unusually high due to the absence of a one-time loss that hurt Q2 2023 results. For Q2 2025, we assume the GAAP operating margin will remain in the low-40s (~41–42%), consistent with the company’s improving profitability (Q1 2025 GAAP margin was 41.8% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20first,our%20Ratings%20and%20Indices%20divisions))). This yields our $1.55 billion operating income forecast. We then add non-cash charges to arrive at EBITDA: S&P Global incurs significant **deal-related amortization** (approx. $1.13 billion for full-year 2024) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Deal,22.5)), which is about $280 million per quarter, plus an estimated $60 million in other depreciation. These add-backs align with the Q2 2024 levels (e.g. ~$268 million intangible amortization in Q2 2024) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=amortization%20of%20intangibles%20from%20acquisitions,June%C2%A030%2C%202024%20and%202023%2C%20respectively)). The result is an EBITDA margin around 50.5%, similar to the 50.7% adjusted operating margin the company reported in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20second%20quarter%20reported,primarily%20due%20to)). This reflects continued **cost discipline and integration synergies** after the IHS Markit merger, as well as operating leverage from revenue growth.

## Net Income & EPS Forecast  
For Q2 2025 we project **Net Income of about $1,150,000,000**, which yields **EPS of approximately $3.78** for the quarter. This assumes interest expense and tax rates in line with guidance and recent results. S&P Global’s interest costs are relatively stable (around $310 million annual run-rate) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Operating%20profit%20margin%20%20,%2417.25)), so we expect roughly $75–80 million in Q2 interest expense. Applying a ~22% effective tax rate (consistent with the company’s 21%–22% GAAP tax guidance) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Operating%20profit%20margin%20%20,%2417.25)) to pre-tax income, net income comes out to ~$1.15 billion. We also factor in the impact of share buybacks: S&P Global executed significant share repurchases in the past year (including a $1.5 billion accelerated buyback in mid-2024 ([www.biia.com](https://www.biia.com/sp-global-q2-2024-revenue-up-14/#:~:text=30,60)) and an additional $650 million program in early 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-global-forecasts-annual-profit-above-estimates-strong-demand-its-offerings-2025-02-11/#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20has%20projected%20its,in%20premarket%20trading))). These buybacks have reduced the diluted share count, amplifying EPS growth. Our EPS forecast of ~$3.78 represents a healthy increase from the $3.23 GAAP EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20reported%20second%20quarter,to%20%244.04)), primarily driven by higher earnings and fewer shares outstanding. (For reference, **adjusted** EPS in Q2 2024 was $4.04 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=increased%2098,to%20%244.04)); we expect Q2 2025 adjusted EPS to be in the mid-$4 range, consistent with the company’s full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $16.75–$17.25 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Interest%20expense%2C%20net%20%20,%2417.25)).)

## Free Cash Flow Forecast  
We anticipate **Free Cash Flow of roughly $1,530,000,000** in Q2 2025. S&P Global’s free cash flow is defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures and distributions to minority interest holders (primarily the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture share). In Q2 2024 free cash flow was $1.464 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Cash%20provided%20by%20operating%20activities,)), benefiting from a rebound in working capital after seasonal outflows in Q1. For Q2 2025, we expect a similar or slightly higher FCF. The company’s full-year 2025 outlook calls for $5.4–$5.6 billion in free cash flow ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000122/spgi1q2025-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20above%2C,5.9)), and Q2 is typically one of the strongest quarters for cash generation. We assume operating cash flow around $1.6 billion for the quarter (vs. $1.556 billion in Q2 2024) supported by higher earnings and some release of working capital. Capital expenditures are estimated at ~$40 million (consistent with increased tech investments; Q2 2024 capex was $32 million) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Cash%20provided%20by%20operating%20activities,)). We also project about $80 million in dividends to noncontrolling interests, slightly above the $60 million paid in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404024000146/spgi2q2024-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20expenditures%20%20,2%2C315)) given growth in the Indices business. The resulting free cash flow aligns with S&P Global’s trend of robust cash generation, underpinned by its high-margin, subscription-oriented businesses. This ample FCF will continue to fund shareholder returns (buybacks and dividends) and strategic investments.

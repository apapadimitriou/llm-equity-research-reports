## Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) – Q2 2025 Forecast

Alphabet Inc. is expected to continue its solid growth trajectory in **Q2 2025**, driven by strength in its core advertising business (Search and YouTube) and robust expansion in its Cloud segment. In **Q1 2025**, Alphabet’s revenue grew **12%** year-over-year to $90.2 billion, with operating income rising to $30.6 billion and net income reaching $34.5 billion (up 46% YoY) ([9to5google.com](https://9to5google.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-q1-2025-earnings/#:~:text=Revenue%20is%20up%2012,in%20net%20income%20last%20quarter)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20operating%20income%20increased%2020,2%20percentage%20points%20to%2034)). This strong Q1 performance – including an operating margin of **34%** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20operating%20income%20increased%2020,2%20percentage%20points%20to%2034)) – reflects improved efficiency and cost discipline following prior restructuring. We anticipate that these trends continued into Q2, underpinned by steady advertiser demand and ongoing Cloud momentum. (In Q2 2024, Alphabet had revenue of $84.7 billion, up 14%, and net income of $23.6 billion ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/alphabet-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-revenue-growth-and-ai-advancements#:~:text=,44%20in%20Q2%202023)), providing a favorable year-ago baseline for growth.)

**Revenue:** We project **double-digit revenue growth** for Q2 2025, approximately **11–12%** YoY. This implies revenue around **$95 billion** for the quarter. Ongoing strength in Google’s ad platforms (search ads, YouTube) and ~30%+ growth in Google Cloud services (as seen in Q1 2025) likely drove this increase. Our forecast assumes stable ad pricing and volume, plus continued recovery in advertiser spending. We also factor in modest contributions from newer business lines (e.g. YouTube subscriptions and Pixel devices) which have been growing.  

**Profitability:** **Operating Income** is expected to rise at a slightly faster pace than revenue on improved margins. Alphabet’s cost controls and efficiency initiatives have been a focus for the new CFO ([www.cfodive.com](https://www.cfodive.com/news/alphabet-cfo-efficiencies-cost-generativeai-google-capex/731494/#:~:text=Anat%20Ashkenazi%20is%20prioritizing%20cost,GenAI%20and%20other%20growth%20areas)), and with Google Cloud now profitable, we anticipate an operating margin in the mid-30s (%) for Q2 2025. We forecast Q2 operating profit around **$32 billion**, up from $27.4 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/alphabet-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-revenue-growth-and-ai-advancements#:~:text=,44%20in%20Q2%202023)). Adding back depreciation and amortization, we estimate **EBITDA** near **$37 billion** for the quarter. This represents a healthy EBITDA margin ~39%, reflecting the high-margin advertising business and improved expense discipline (e.g. slower headcount growth and infrastructure optimization).

**Net Income and EPS:** We project **Net Income** of roughly **$27 billion** in Q2 2025, translating to an **EPS** of about **$2.15**. This assumes Alphabet’s effective tax rate and other income/expenses are in a normal range (unlike Q1, which saw a large boost from unrealized investment gains ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,2.81))). Our net income forecast is higher than the $23.6 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/alphabet-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-revenue-growth-and-ai-advancements#:~:text=,44%20in%20Q2%202023)), thanks to higher operating profit and additional interest income on Alphabet’s substantial cash reserves. The EPS increase also benefits from ongoing share repurchases keeping the diluted share count relatively flat or slightly lower. 

**Free Cash Flow:** We expect **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** to come in around **$15 billion** for Q2 2025. Alphabet’s operating cash flow is robust – Q2 2024 saw $26.6 billion cash from operations ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=,132%2C601)) – and should improve with higher earnings in Q2 2025. However, **capital expenditures** are also rising significantly as Alphabet invests in data centers and AI infrastructure. The CFO has signaled a substantial increase in capex to ~$75 billion for 2025 ([www.cfodive.com](https://www.cfodive.com/news/alphabet-cfo-says-capex-reach-ai-push-grows/739355/#:~:text=capex%20to%20be%20in%20the,AI%20efforts%20and%20core%20business)), and indeed Q4 2024 alone saw about $14 billion in capex ([www.cfodive.com](https://www.cfodive.com/news/alphabet-cfo-says-capex-reach-ai-push-grows/739355/#:~:text=Alphabet%E2%80%99s%20total%20capex%20in%20the,data%20centers%2C%20Ashkenazi%20told%20investors)). We expect Q2 2025 capex in the high-teens of billions, which will moderate free cash flow growth. Our $15 billion FCF forecast is slightly above the $13.5 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=,132%2C601)), balancing higher cash earnings against heavier investment spending this quarter.

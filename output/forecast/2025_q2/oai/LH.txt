# Labcorp (LH) – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

Labcorp Inc. (LH) has transitioned into a pure-play laboratory diagnostics company following the mid-2023 spin-off of its clinical development (CRO) business, Fortrea ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=The%20change%20in%20Other%2C%20net,are%20included%20in%20operating%20income)). The company’s **Q1 2025** results showed solid base-business growth (revenue up 5.3% year-on-year) and management reaffirmed a robust **2025 full-year outlook**, targeting ~7–8% revenue growth and improved profitability ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2025-first-quarter-results#:~:text=,25%20billion)). Key growth drivers include strong demand for routine and specialty testing as patients resume healthcare deferred during the pandemic ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/labcorp-beats-quarterly-estimates-diagnostic-test-demand-2024-10-24/#:~:text=demand%20www,pandemic%2C%20diagnostic%20checkups%20have%20increased)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/labcorp-beats-q2-profit-revenue-estimates-demand-health-tests-2024-08-01/#:~:text=health%20tests%20www,to)), plus contributions from acquisitions (e.g. genetic test assets from Invitae in 2024) which add roughly ~1% to top-line growth ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=%2A%20Updated%20Full,00%20billion%2C%20includes%C2%A0Invitae%20cash)). Below we outline our **Q2 2025** forecasts for Revenue, EBITDA, Operating Income, Net Income, Free Cash Flow, and EPS, along with the assumptions behind these estimates.

## Revenue Outlook for Q2 2025  
Labcorp’s **Q2 2024 revenue was $3.22 billion**, up 6.2% year-on-year ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,in%20organic%20revenue%20was%20driven)), reflecting organic volume increases (~3.8%) and acquisition contributions (~2.5%) ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,in%20organic%20revenue%20was%20driven)). For **Q2 2025**, we project revenue in the mid-to-high single digits above last year’s level, driven by sustained strong demand for diagnostic testing and continued post-pandemic volume recovery ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/labcorp-beats-quarterly-estimates-diagnostic-test-demand-2024-10-24/#:~:text=demand%20www,pandemic%2C%20diagnostic%20checkups%20have%20increased)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/labcorp-beats-q2-profit-revenue-estimates-demand-health-tests-2024-08-01/#:~:text=health%20tests%20www,to)). The company’s full-year 2025 guidance calls for ~7.4% midpoint revenue growth ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=%2A%20Full,2)), and notably **Q1 2025 delivered 6.0% growth in the base business (organic + acquisitions)** ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2025-first-quarter-results#:~:text=Organic,between%20the%20Base%20Business%20and)). We expect **Q2 2025 revenue** to rise around 7% year-over-year. This incorporates organic growth from new test launches and hospital lab partnership wins, plus incremental sales from 2024 acquisitions (e.g. the Invitae genetics assets, which closed in Aug 2024) ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=,in%20Southwest%20Florida%20to)). Our forecast is approximately **$3.45 billion** for Q2 2025 revenue, which would keep Labcorp on track with its annual growth plan.

## Profitability: EBITDA and Operating Income  
Labcorp has been pursuing cost efficiencies (the “LaunchPad” initiative) to expand margins ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=same%20period%20in%202023,was%20driven%20by%20demand%20and)), even as it invests in new capabilities. In **Q2 2024**, the company achieved an operating margin of 9.2% (GAAP operating income $294.8 million) ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=Operating%20income%20for%20the%20quarter,0%20million%20during%20the)), a slight improvement from 8.8% a year prior. On an adjusted basis (excluding one-time items and amortization), operating margin was ~14.9%, essentially flat year-on-year ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=same%20period%20in%202023,was%20driven%20by%20demand%20and)). For **Q2 2025**, we anticipate **operating income will improve modestly** to roughly **9.5% of sales**, driven by higher testing volumes and ongoing efficiency gains ([www2.labcorp.com](https://www2.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=strengthened%20our%20presence%20in%20key,of%20patients%20around%20the%20world)). However, continued amortization of intangibles from recent acquisitions will temper GAAP margin expansion (Labcorp’s Q2 2024 amortization was $62 million, which increased from the prior year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=Selling%2C%20general%20and%20administrative%20expenses,596.1))). We project **Operating Income of about $330 million** for Q2 2025, up roughly 12% year-on-year. 

Adding back depreciation and amortization, **EBITDA** is expected to be on the order of **$480–$500 million** for the quarter. This assumes depreciation and amortization in the ~$170 million range (slightly higher than last year’s ~$156 million in Q2, given new assets) and reflects a roughly stable EBITDA margin around 14–15%. Overall, our EBITDA forecast (~$500 million) aligns with mid-single-digit growth from the prior year, consistent with Labcorp’s emphasis on **margin expansion in 2025** ([www2.labcorp.com](https://www2.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=strengthened%20our%20presence%20in%20key,of%20patients%20around%20the%20world)) alongside top-line growth.

## Net Income and EPS  
Labcorp’s **net income from continuing operations in Q2 2024 was $205.6 million** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=Earnings%20from%20continuing%20operations%20,401.8)) (GAAP), which yielded diluted EPS of $2.43 ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=,42)). That GAAP earnings figure included some favorable one-time gains, such as ~$22.9 million in Fortrea transition service fees recorded as other income ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=Other%2C%20net%20%20,)), as well as ongoing acquisition-related amortization expenses that depressed operating profit. Looking ahead to **Q2 2025**, we expect net profit to increase modestly on higher operating income, while assuming no repeat of the prior-year one-time gains (the Fortrea transition fees likely ended by mid-2024). 

Interest expense should be slightly lower or stable (Labcorp had ~$47 million interest cost in Q2 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=Other%20income%20%28expense%29%3A%20%20,113.7)), which could ease if strong cash flows were used to repay debt). We assume a ~23–24% effective tax rate consistent with recent quarters ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920148/000092014824000099/lh-20240630.htm#:~:text=Earnings%20from%20continuing%20operations%20before,402.4)). Additionally, share buybacks are likely to enhance EPS: the company expanded its repurchase authorization by $1 billion in mid-2024 ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=,tests%20in%20specialty%20testing%20areas)) and has been actively retiring shares. Given these factors, we forecast **Q2 2025 net income around $220 million**, and **diluted EPS of approximately $2.70**. This represents a high-single to low-double-digit percentage increase in EPS versus the $2.43 reported in the year-ago quarter ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=,42)), primarily driven by revenue growth and a lower share count. Our EPS estimate is in line with management’s improved full-year 2025 adjusted EPS outlook (midpoint ~$16.05 for the year) ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2025-first-quarter-results#:~:text=,25%20billion)) when accounting for the usual Q4 weighting of Labcorp’s earnings.

## Free Cash Flow  
Labcorp’s business model is cash-generative, and the company expected **$1.1–$1.25 billion of free cash flow (FCF) in 2025** ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=%2A%20Full,2)), up from about $1.10 billion achieved in 2024 ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=,7%20million)). In **Q2 2024**, free cash flow from continuing operations was **$432.9 million**, a sharp increase from just $58 million in Q2 2023 ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=result%2C%20free%20cash%20flow%20from,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)). That jump was partly due to working capital normalization after the Fortrea spin and the timing of certain payments. Typically, Labcorp’s cash flow is seasonally weakest in Q1 (due to annual payouts and working capital builds) and strongest in Q4 ([www.labcorp.com](https://www.labcorp.com/labcorp-announces-2024-second-quarter-results#:~:text=result%2C%20free%20cash%20flow%20from,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)), with Q2 and Q3 in between. Given the expected higher earnings in Q2 2025 and no significant one-time uses of cash, we project **Q2 2025 free cash flow around $450 million**. This slight increase over the prior-year quarter reflects improved operating profit and disciplined capital spending. It keeps the company on pace to meet its full-year FCF target, with the second half (especially Q4) providing the remainder.

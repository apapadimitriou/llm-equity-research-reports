# Wells Fargo Q2 2025 Forecast

As of July 1, 2025, we base our Q2 2025 forecasts on Wells Fargo’s recent performance and publicly available guidance. In the first quarter of 2025, Wells Fargo saw a slight revenue decline (down ~3% year-over-year) due to lower net interest income, but managed to grow net income by 6% ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=In%20the%20three,benefits%20and%20debt%20security%20losses)) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=In%20the%20three,benefits%20and%20debt%20security%20losses)). This was achieved through higher fee-based revenue and cost controls – non-interest income was stable and expenses actually fell about 3% year-over-year in Q1 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2775378/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges?mobile=true#:~:text=,million%20from%20the%20fourth%20quarter)). In Q2 2024, Wells Fargo’s revenue was $20.689 billion with net income of $4.9 billion ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=1)), and management noted fee growth offsetting interest margin pressure ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=Charlie%20Scharf%2C%20CEO%20of%20Wells,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=,trading%2C%20and%20investment%20banking%20fees)). We expect these trends to continue or improve in Q2 2025.

## Key Drivers for Q2 2025

- **Net Interest Income (NII):** Rising interest rates in 2022-2023 had boosted banks’ interest income, but by 2024 higher deposit costs were squeezing margins ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,interest%20rates%20on%20funding%20costs)). Wells Fargo’s NII fell ~9% in Q2 2024 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,interest%20rates%20on%20funding%20costs)) and 6% in Q1 2025 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=included%20discrete%20tax%20benefits%20and,debt%20security%20losses)) year-over-year. However, the bank guided that full-year 2025 NII would be **1–3% higher than 2024** ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wells-fargo-q4-net-income-rises-revenue-down-slightly-issues-2025-outlook#:~:text=For%202025%2C%20Wells%20Fargo%20anticipates,a%20sustainable%20ROTCE%20of%2015)), implying the downward trend is reversing. We project Q2 2025 NII to stabilize or rise slightly versus the $11.92 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,interest%20rates%20on%20funding%20costs)). This assumes funding cost pressures have eased and loan growth or repricing adds some interest income. 

- **Fee Income:** Wells Fargo’s diversified fee-based businesses (investment banking, trading, wealth management, etc.) have been performing well. In Q2 2024, non-interest income was robust, contributing to a slight increase in total revenue year-over-year despite weaker NII ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=1)). Q1 2025 saw fee revenue roughly flat year-over-year ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2775378/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges?mobile=true#:~:text=,million%20from%20the%20fourth%20quarter)), but with growth in areas like credit card and wealth management fees ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2775378/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges?mobile=true#:~:text=,compared%20with%20a%20year)). For Q2 2025, we expect solid fee income similar to last year’s strong result. Even if capital markets activity is only stable, continued strength in advisory, brokerage, and card fees should help keep total **Revenue** modestly above the year-ago quarter.

- **Expenses:** Management has been focused on efficiency. Non-interest expense in Q1 2025 was down 3% from a year prior ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2775378/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges?mobile=true#:~:text=,growth%20from%20the%20fourth%20quarter)), reflecting cost-cutting (including workforce reductions) and lower operating losses. In Q2 2024, expenses were a bit elevated (up ~2% YoY) at $13.3 billion ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=1)), partly due to investments and inflation. We anticipate Q2 2025 **expenses** will be flat or slightly lower year-over-year, as ongoing efficiency efforts (headcount down ~20% since 2020 ([yourbusinessgazette.com](https://yourbusinessgazette.com/2024/10/13/earnings-call-wells-fargo-reports-solid-q3-with-5-1-billion-net-income/#:~:text=Bullish%20Highlights))) offset any growth in compensation or tech investments. This improvement in the cost base should boost operating margins.

- **Credit Costs:** The credit quality has been relatively benign. Wells Fargo’s provision for credit losses was $1.24 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=,713%20billion%20in%20Q2%202023)), which was actually lower than the year before as credit trends normalized post-pandemic. In Q1 2025 the provision was even lower, about $932 million ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=first%20quarter)), with stable credit metrics and a small reduction in loan loss reserves. Given a somewhat uncertain economic outlook, we assume Q2 2025 **provisions** tick up slightly from Q1 – roughly around $1.0–1.1 billion – but still near the prior-year level (and well below early-cycle highs). This means credit costs remain manageable and not a major drag on earnings.

- **Capital & Share Count:** Wells Fargo has been returning significant capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. In the first half of 2024 alone, the bank repurchased over $12 billion of stock ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2024-earnings.html#:~:text=to%20%2420,quarter)), and it continued buybacks into 2025 (e.g. $3.5 billion worth in Q1 2025, about 44.5 million shares ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=economic%20environment%20in%202025%2C%20but,timing%20of%20the%20policy%20changes))). This has materially reduced the share count, boosting **EPS** growth beyond net income growth. For example, diluted EPS in Q1 2025 was up 16% YoY while net income was up 6% ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2775378/wells-fargo-co-wfc-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-eps-growth-amid-revenue-challenges?mobile=true#:~:text=,million%20from%20the%20fourth%20quarter)), thanks to share repurchases. We expect further buybacks in Q2 2025 to have reduced the share count versus Q2 2024 by around 5%. This magnifies EPS for the quarter.

## Forecast Summary for 2025-Q2

Combining the above factors, we project **Revenue** for Q2 2025 to increase slightly (roughly 1% year-over-year). Modestly higher NII (as interest margins begin to stabilize) along with sustained fee income should yield revenue around $20.9 billion for the quarter, up from $20.69 billion a year ago ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=1)). With flat-to-down expenses and similar credit provisions, **Operating Income** (pre-tax profit) is set to improve more substantially. We forecast operating profit around $6.75 billion, up from an estimated ~$6.16 billion in Q2 last year (which was revenue $20.69B minus $13.29B expenses minus $1.24B provisions). 

After estimated taxes, Q2 2025 **Net Income** is forecast at approximately **$5.4 billion**, about a 10% increase from the $4.9 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=2,EPS)). The earnings growth is driven by a slightly higher top line and better efficiency (cost ratio improvement). Finally, factoring in the reduced share count, we anticipate **EPS** (earnings per share) to show a stronger gain – on the order of  Fifteen to Twenty percent growth year-over-year. Our EPS forecast for Q2 2025 is **around $1.55** per share (vs. $1.33 in Q2 2024 ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/wells-fargo-reports-q2-2024-earnings-net-income-of-4-9-billion#:~:text=2,EPS))). We summarize our projections in the table below.

| Company      | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|-------------|------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Wells Fargo | 2025 | 2       | 20,900,000,000 | 8,750,000,000 | 6,750,000,000    | 5,400,000,000  | 6,000,000,000    | 1.56  |

This forecast reflects our independent analysis of Wells Fargo’s public financial data and trends. **Revenue** is expected to be slightly higher than last year’s quarter due to stabilizing interest income and solid fees. We forecast **EBITDA** and **Operating Income** to improve as expense cuts take hold. **Net Income** should grow about 10%, and with continued buybacks, **EPS** could rise well into the double digits percentage-wise, showcasing the bank’s enhanced profitability and capital return in Q2 2025. All figures are in absolute dollars (not in millions/billions) for clarity per the requested format.

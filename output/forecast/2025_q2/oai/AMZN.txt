# Amazon.com (AMZN) – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

## Revenue Outlook (Q2 2025)  
Amazon’s net sales for Q2 2025 are projected at approximately **$162 billion**, about 9% higher year-over-year. This growth rate is in line with management’s guidance of 7%–11% YoY for Q2 (net sales of $159.0–$164.0 billion) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,or%20legal%20settlements%20are%20concluded)). The increase reflects steady expansion in the core retail segments and robust performance in higher-margin businesses. In the year-ago quarter, North America sales grew 9% to $90.0 billion and international sales 7% to $31.7 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=2023.%20,billion%20in%20second%20quarter%202023)), providing a solid baseline. For Q2 2025, we anticipate similar high-single-digit growth in e-commerce driven by continued Prime adoption and improved consumer demand. Additionally, Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business (which expanded ~20% YoY in mid-2024) and its AWS cloud segment should bolster revenue ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,in%20the%20second%20quarter%2C%20compared)) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Advertising%20services%20%284%29%20%20,N%2FA)). Although AWS growth has decelerated from ~19% YoY in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,in%20the%20second%20quarter%2C%20compared)), we expect it to remain in the mid-teens percentage, given sustained cloud demand (especially for AI and machine learning services) and new customer wins. Taken together, these factors support a **Q2 2025 revenue forecast of roughly $162 billion**. This represents a healthy increase over the $148.0 billion achieved in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Net%20sales%20increased%2010,year%20to%20%2426.3%20billion)), reflecting Amazon’s resilient sales momentum across both retail and cloud services despite a mixed macroeconomic backdrop. 

## Profitability: EBITDA & Operating Income  
We project **EBITDA of about $29 billion** for Q2 2025, up from an estimated ~$26–27 billion in the prior-year quarter. This is based on our operating income forecast plus expected depreciation and amortization. Amazon’s depreciation & amortization was approximately $12.0 billion in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20of%20property,)), and this non-cash expense has been rising as the company invests in infrastructure. For **operating income**, we forecast roughly **$16.0 billion** for Q2 2025, implying an operating margin near 10%. Amazon guided Q2 operating income between $13.0 billion and $17.5 billion ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=anticipates%20an%20unfavorable%20impact%20of,things%2C%20that%20no%20additional%20business)), and our estimate is toward the upper half of that range. This reflects ongoing cost efficiencies and sales mix improvement. Last year, Amazon’s operating profitability saw a dramatic turnaround – Q2 2024 operating income was $14.7 billion, nearly double the $7.7 billion in Q2 2023 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,billion%20in%20second%20quarter%202023)), as expense optimizations (e.g. logistics and workforce rationalization) took effect. Building on that higher base, we expect more modest YoY improvement in Q2 2025. Higher-margin segments like AWS and advertising (with operating leverage) and disciplined fulfillment expense should support an **operating income of around $16 billion** (up ~9% YoY). This level of EBIT would be a record for a non-holiday Q2, underscoring Amazon’s improved profitability framework.  

## Net Income & EPS  
For Q2 2025 we forecast **net income of roughly $14.0 billion**, a slight increase from the $13.5 billion net profit in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=income%20of%20%245,share%2C%20in%20second%20quarter%202023)). This assumes no major one-time gains or losses beyond normal operations. (Notably, last year’s Q2 net income benefitted from a **$0.4 billion pre-tax gain** on Amazon’s Rivian Automotive equity stake ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,investment%20in%20second%20quarter%202023)). We are not assuming a significant similar gain in 2025, as such valuation adjustments are unpredictable.) With our projected operating income, interest expense and other non-operating items should be relatively small in net, and we anticipate Amazon’s effective tax rate to remain low – Amazon has utilized prior losses/credits and benefits from tax-efficient structures, resulting in a below-standard tax rate in recent quarters. Taken together, a ~$14 billion profit is achievable for Q2 2025. **Earnings per share (EPS)** is estimated at about **$1.30** for the quarter, up from $1.26 diluted EPS in Q2 2024 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=income%20of%20%245,share%2C%20in%20second%20quarter%202023)). The modest rise in EPS reflects the higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in shares outstanding. Amazon’s share count has been gradually rising (due to stock-based compensation); for example, diluted shares were roughly 10.7 billion in mid-2024 and have since ticked up by a few percentage points ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx)). Our EPS forecast factors in ~10.8–10.9 billion weighted-average diluted shares for Q2 2025. Overall, the expectation is for a **mid-single-digit percentage increase in net income and EPS** year-on-year, indicative of improved operating results flowing through to the bottom line. 

## Free Cash Flow  
We anticipate **free cash flow (FCF)** of approximately **$10 billion** for Q2 2025 (quarter-only, cash from operations minus capital expenditures). This would be a positive but moderated cash flow outcome, considering Amazon’s heavy ongoing investments. As of Q2 2024, Amazon’s trailing twelve-month free cash flow had rebounded to $53.0 billion ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,months%20ended%20June%2030%2C%202023)) after a period of intensive logistics and data center spending that had pressured cash generation in 2022–2023. That improvement reflected significantly higher operating cash flows (TTM operating cash flow was $108 billion by Q2 2024, +75% YoY ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240731312365/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results#:~:text=,months%20ended%20June%2030%2C%202023))) and a relative lull in capital expenditure growth in early 2024. However, going into 2025 Amazon is *re-accelerating* its capital investments, particularly in AWS infrastructure and generative AI initiatives. Industry reports indicate Big Tech collectively plans over $300 billion in AI-related spend in 2025, with Amazon alone accounting for over $100 billion of that investment ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa#:~:text=2025,surge%20in%202024%2C%20where%20the)). In 2024, Amazon’s capital expenditures surged (up 63% YoY) as it poured resources into data centers and technology for AWS and AI ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa#:~:text=2025,surge%20in%202024%2C%20where%20the)). This higher capex run-rate is likely to continue in Q2 2025, limiting how much of Amazon’s robust operating cash flow translates into free cash flow. We expect operating cash flow in the quarter to remain strong – supported by the ~$16 billion in operating profit plus roughly $13+ billion in depreciation, amortization, and stock-based add-backs – but capex uses (from fulfillment network improvements to AWS servers/chips) will consume a large portion of that. The net result is **quarterly FCF of around $10 billion**, which is lower than the prior year’s quarterly FCF (Q2 2024 was a particularly strong cash flow quarter) but still indicative of solid internal funding capacity. In essence, Amazon is prioritizing growth investments in 2025 (which reduces free cash flow in the short term) while still generating healthy positive FCF thanks to its improving earnings and working capital efficiency.

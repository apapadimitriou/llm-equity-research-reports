## Arista Networks Q2 2025 Forecast

Arista Networks delivered strong growth in the first quarter of 2025, surpassing $2.0 billion in revenue (up 27.6% year-on-year) ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024)). This momentum is expected to continue into Q2 2025. The company’s own guidance for Q2 2025 is for approximately $2.1 billion in revenue ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,2025%2C%20we%20expect)), which represents roughly 24% growth over the $1.690 billion achieved in Q2 2024 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2024/Arista-Networks-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)). This growth is fueled by robust demand from cloud and AI networking customers – Arista has benefited from an **“AI boom”** driving strong orders for its data center switching gear ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/arista-networks-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-above-estimates-ai-boom-2024-07-30/#:~:text=2024,The%20company%27s%20competitor%20Juniper)). 

Profitability remains a highlight for Arista. Gross margins are expected to remain around 63% (non-GAAP) in Q2 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,2025%2C%20we%20expect)), and the company guided to a non-GAAP operating margin of about 46% ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,2025%2C%20we%20expect)). Taking into account typical stock-based compensation and other GAAP expenses, we forecast a **GAAP operating income** in the mid-$800 million range for Q2 2025. (For reference, GAAP operating margin was 42.8% in Q1 2025 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx)); our Q2 forecast assumes a similar ~41%–42% GAAP operating margin on $2.1 billion revenue.) This yields an **operating income** estimate of about **$860 million** for Q2. Adding back modest depreciation and amortization (which were only ~$14 million in Q1 2025 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Adjustments%20to%20reconcile%20net%20income,))), we project **EBITDA** around **$875 million** for the quarter.

Net income is expected to rise substantially year-on-year. Given Arista’s operating income and additional interest income from its large cash holdings (other income was $96 million in Q1 2025 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20operating%20expenses%20%20,722.8))), **pre-tax income** should approach ~$960 million in Q2. Assuming an effective tax rate in the mid-teens (Arista’s tax rate was ~15% in recent quarters), we forecast **GAAP net income** around **$820 million** for Q2 2025. This would be roughly 23% higher than the $665.4 million GAAP net profit in Q2 2024 ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2024/Arista-Networks-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Non,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202023)). With an estimated ~1.27 billion diluted shares (Q1 2025 had 1.279 billion diluted shares ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=GAAP%20diluted%20net%20income%20per,43.8)), and the company has been executing share buybacks), that net income translates to **EPS** (earnings per share) of approximately **$0.65** for Q2 2025. 

Finally, Arista’s **free cash flow** is anticipated to remain very robust. The company historically converts a large portion of earnings into cash – for example, operating cash flow in the first half of 2024 was $1.503 billion, well above the $1.303 billion in net income for that period ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2024/Arista-Networks-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,)). In Q1 2025, Arista’s operating cash flow was $641.7 million despite a significant build-up in accounts receivable and inventory ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Changes%20in%20operating%20assets%20and,513.8)), and capital expenditures were only $28.4 million ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Proceeds%20from%20maturities%20of%20marketable,)). In Q2, some of that working capital is likely to normalize as receivables are collected, boosting cash flow. We project **free cash flow** on the order of **$900 million** for Q2 2025, assuming operating cash generation improves with revenue growth and capex remains relatively modest (the company is investing in a new campus building, but quarterly capex is still low relative to revenue ([investors.arista.com](https://investors.arista.com/Communications/Press-Releases-and-Events/Press-Release-Detail/2025/Arista-Networks-Inc--Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Proceeds%20from%20maturities%20of%20marketable,))). 

All the above projections are summarized in the table below. These figures represent our forecasts for Arista’s **2025 Q2** financial metrics, based on public information available as of July 22, 2025 and Arista’s own guidance and trends:

# Visa 2025-Q2 Financial Forecast (Quarter Ended June 30, 2025)

## Performance Trends and Outlook  
**Recent Results:** Visa delivered strong results in the comparable period last year (fiscal Q3 2024), with net revenue of $8.9 billion (up 10% YoY) and GAAP net income of $4.9 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000040/q32024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20net%20income%20of%20%244,8B)). More recently, in fiscal Q2 2025 (Jan–Mar 2025), Visa’s net revenues grew 9% YoY to $9.6 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=,the%20rest%20of%20the%20fiscal)), supported by resilient consumer spending and robust payment volumes. U.S. payment volume grew ~8% in Q2, and **cross-border** volumes (a key driver of international fees) jumped 13% YoY ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=For%20constant%20dollar%20cross%20border,we%20are%20not%20economic%20forecasters)), reflecting continued strength in travel and e-commerce. These trends underscore Visa’s strong positioning, with management noting *“resilience in consumer spending”* despite macro uncertainties ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=The%20potential%20impacts%20from%20tariffs,Q4%20twenty%20twenty%20four%20levels)).

**Guidance & Assumptions:** Looking ahead to the April–June 2025 quarter (fiscal Q3 2025), Visa’s management guided for **“low double-digit”** YoY net revenue growth, essentially in line with the ~9–11% growth seen in Q2 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=result%20of%20some%20client%20performance,Moving%20to%20operating%20expenses)). This outlook assumes continued healthy payment volumes and moderating (but still strong) cross-border activity into the summer travel season. Visa’s operating expenses are expected to rise at a similar **low-double-digit** pace ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=As%20we%20had%20some%20timing,expect%20a%20minimal%20benefit%20to)), implying that operating margins should remain roughly stable. Non-operating income will include a one-time ~$150 million benefit from a tax-related interest reversal ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=those%20to%20occur%20in%20the,EPS%20growth%20in%20the%20third)), and the effective tax rate is forecast around 17.0–17.5% (slightly lower than ~18.6% a year ago) ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=the%20low%20double%20digits%2C%20relatively,EPS%20growth%20in%20the%20third)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000040/q32024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Client%20incentives%20%20,)). Taken together, these factors point to solid profit growth for the quarter.

**Earnings & Cash Flow Impacts:** Net income is projected to increase moderately year-on-year (mid-teens growth on an adjusted basis) as revenue gains are partially offset by higher client incentive payments and operating costs. Importantly, Visa’s aggressive share repurchase program will boost EPS by reducing the share count – for example, Visa bought back ~13 million shares in the March quarter for $4.5 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20three%20months%20ended,repurchases%20as%20of%20March%C2%A031%2C%202025)), and continued buybacks are expected. Management indicated **“high teens”** growth in adjusted EPS for Q3 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=includes%20a%20benefit%20from%20the,growth%20in%20the%20third%20quarter)), which we reflect in our forecast. Visa’s **free cash flow** generation should remain very robust, supported by its high profit margins and low capital needs. Historically, fiscal Q3 has seen exceptionally strong free cash flow (e.g. ~$12 billion in Q3 2024) as operating cash inflows often exceed accounting earnings ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/V/visa/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,30%20%20%7C%2012%2C298.00)). However, we anticipate FCF will be slightly lower than last year’s peak, given higher cash outlays for client incentives (rebates and partnership deals) in the second half of FY2025. Even so, free cash flow around ~$9–10 billion is likely, easily covering dividends and buybacks. 

## Forecasted Financials for 2025-Q2 (Visa Inc.)  
The table below summarizes our projections for Visa’s **2025 Q2** (fiscal Q3 2025) results, compared to the year-ago quarter. All figures are in USD and are presented as full nominal amounts (no millions/billions shorthand), aligning with Visa’s financial reporting format.

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow   | EPS   |
|---------|------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Visa    | 2025 | 2       | 9,800,000,000  | 6,830,000,000 | 6,540,000,000    | 5,550,000,000 | 9,500,000,000   | 2.85  |

**Key Drivers:** We expect **Revenue** around $9.8 billion for the quarter, up roughly 10% YoY, driven by sustained growth in payment volumes and double-digit cross-border transaction expansion ([www.akcier.com](https://www.akcier.com/news/visa-reports-strong-fiscal-third-quarter-2024-results#:~:text=The%20company%20saw%20net%20revenue,to%20Visa%27s%20international%20transaction%20revenue)). **EBITDA** and **Operating Income** should rise in tandem – Visa’s high operating leverage means incremental revenues largely translate to profit. We forecast operating income near $6.5 billion, maintaining an operating margin in the mid-60s (%) range. **Net Income** is projected at about $5.55 billion, reflecting the operating growth plus the $150M non-operating gain and a slight tax rate improvement. **Free Cash Flow** is forecast around $9.5 billion; Visa’s Q3 cash flow has historically far exceeded net income ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/V/visa/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,30%20%20%7C%2012%2C298.00)) due to timing of client incentives and settlement-related flows, though higher incentive payments this year may temper it slightly. Finally, **EPS** is estimated at approximately **$2.85**, a robust increase from the $2.40 GAAP EPS in the year-ago quarter ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000040/q32024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Visa%20Reports%20Fiscal%20Third%20Quarter,dollar%20basis)). This EPS growth benefits not only from higher profits but also from ongoing share buybacks reducing the share count (enhancing EPS growth relative to net income). Overall, Visa’s **2025-Q2** is expected to show healthy double-digit growth across key metrics, underscoring the company’s resilience and strong cash-generating capability in a steady consumer spending environment ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=USD%20%20%7C%20,%282)) ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-visa-q2-2025-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-3680954#:~:text=together%2C%20we%20expect%20third%20quarter,Moving%20to%20operating%20expenses)).

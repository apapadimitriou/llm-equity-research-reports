# Eli Lilly Q2 2025 Forecast

Eli Lilly and Company is expected to deliver another quarter of robust growth in **2025 Q2**, driven by surging demand for its diabetes and obesity treatments. In the prior year’s Q2, Lilly’s revenue jumped 36% (46% excluding a one-time asset sale) to $11.30 billion ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=Second,and)), propelled by its incretin therapies (Mounjaro and Zepbound) and other growth products. More recently, **2025 Q1** revenue surged 45% year-over-year to $12.73 billion ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=,0%20billion)), indicating strong momentum heading into Q2. Management has reiterated full-year 2025 revenue guidance of **$58–61 billion**, about **32%** growth vs. 2024 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=2025%20Financial%20Guidance%20The%20company,as%20Zepbound%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Jaypirca%2C%20Ebglyss)) ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=obesity%20and%20diabetes%20Phase%203,0%20billion)), implying a significant step-up in the remaining quarters. We expect **Q2 2025 revenue** around **$15.56 billion**, roughly **38%** higher than Q2 last year, reflecting continued volume gains from Mounjaro and the U.S. launch ramp of Zepbound ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=Strong%20performance%20by%20the%20company%27s,vials%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)), partially offset by modest price declines as patient discount programs normalize ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=Higher%20realized%20prices%20were%20primarily,offset%20by%20lower%20Trulicity%20sales)). Robust demand and improved production capacity have alleviated supply constraints, enabling Lilly to better meet surging orders in this quarter ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=Strong%20performance%20by%20the%20company%27s,vials%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks)).

Lilly’s **profitability** in Q2 2025 should expand markedly due to operating leverage and fewer one-time costs. In Q1 2025, operating expenses grew much slower than sales – for instance, R&D spend rose only 8% year-on-year ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=In%20Q1%202025%2C%20research%20and,stage%20portfolio)) – leading to higher margins. We anticipate a similar trend in Q2. Last year’s Q2 included **$154.3 million** of acquired in-process R&D expense and a **$435.0 million** litigation charge ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=In%20Q2%202024%2C%20the%20company,1%20million%20in%20Q2%202023)), which weighed on operating income. With no comparable charges disclosed for Q2 2025, Lilly’s **operating margin** is set to improve significantly. We forecast **EBITDA** and **operating income** to roughly double year-over-year. Strong sales and moderating cost growth likely push **operating income** to around **$6.5 billion** for the quarter, up from roughly $3.6 billion a year ago (excluding last year’s one-offs). After accounting for a typical mid-teens effective tax rate (15–16% in prior periods ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=higher%20net%20interest%20expenses))) and net other expense (e.g. investment losses) of ~$200 million, we project **net income** about **$5.5 billion** for Q2 2025 — nearly **85%** higher than the $2.97 billion earned in Q2 2024 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=rate%20reflects%20the%20impact%20of,sale%20of%20rights%20for%20Baqsimi)). This equates to an **EPS** near **$6.10**, a sharp increase from the $3.28 reported in the year-ago quarter ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=rate%20reflects%20the%20impact%20of,sale%20of%20rights%20for%20Baqsimi)). The jump in per-share earnings underscores Lilly’s explosive revenue growth and improved margins, absent last year’s transitory charges.

Finally, we expect **free cash flow** to strengthen in Q2 2025, though it will be tempered by Lilly’s aggressive investment program. Higher profits should boost operating cash generation, but Lilly continues to pour capital into new production facilities and R&D pipeline expansion. The company recently outlined major manufacturing investments (e.g. a **$5.3 billion** API plant expansion in Indiana) to support Tirzepatide production ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-q2-2024-financial-results-raises-full-year-revenue#:~:text=,informing%20the%20public%20about%20potentially)), and it announced acquisitions of several biotech firms in 2023–2025 to augment its pipeline ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-second-quarter-2023-financial-results-highlights/#:~:text=of%20mirikizumab%20in%20the%20EU,09%20of%20acquired%20IPR%26D%20charges)). These initiatives entail substantial capital outlays. We project **free cash flow** around **$4.5 billion** for Q2, reflecting strong cash earnings offset by heavy capital expenditures on new plants and capacity expansion. Overall, Eli Lilly is on track for a record quarter, with unprecedented sales driving high earnings growth, while still funding its long-term growth through reinvestment.

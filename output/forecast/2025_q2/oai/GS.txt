## Goldman Sachs (GS) – Q2 2025 Financial Forecast

Goldman Sachs is expected to deliver higher revenue in **2Q 2025** compared to the prior year, supported by a healthier deal pipeline and active trading environment. We project **net revenues** of about **$13.5 billion** for the quarter, roughly 6% higher year-on-year (2Q 2024 was $12.73 billion ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-07-15-q2-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20July%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93%C2%A0The,ROE%29%20was))). This reflects improved performance in investment banking and trading versus last year, though a moderation from the exceptionally strong 1Q 2025 level of $15.06 billion ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-04-14-q1-results#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2014%2C%202025,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202025)). Management commentary suggests that while the deal pipeline remains robust (with a 30% rise in large transactions year-to-date) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-says-deal-outlook-is-good-timing-is-uncertain-2025-05-29/#:~:text=banking%20sector%E2%80%99s%20prospects%2C%20despite%20uncertainties,Liberation%20Day.%20Waldron)), overall activity in 2Q has lagged behind 1Q ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-says-deal-outlook-is-good-timing-is-uncertain-2025-05-29/#:~:text=%24500%20million%29%20year,Liberation%20Day.%20Waldron)). The operating backdrop in early 2Q 2025 was “markedly different” from 1Q ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-04-14-q1-results#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20Chairman%20and%20CEO,%E2%80%9D)) – pointing to some uncertainty – but increased market volatility likely bolstered client trading volumes. Taken together, these factors should yield solid revenue growth on a year-over-year basis.

On the cost side, Goldman Sachs has been disciplined. **Operating expenses** in 2Q 2024 were $8.53 billion (essentially flat vs. 2Q 2023) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312524178830/d839513dex991.htm#:~:text=Operating%20Expenses)), and in 1Q 2025 they rose about 5% year-on-year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=Operating%20expenses%20were%20%249,The%20increase%20in%20operating%20expenses)). We assume a similar modest expense increase for 2Q 2025 as the firm continues efficiency efforts. This implies an **operating income** (pre-tax profit) around **$4.3 billion**, up from approximately $3.9 billion in the prior-year quarter ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312524178830/d839513dex991.htm#:~:text=Total%20operating%20expenses%20%20,)). Adding back roughly **$0.5 billion** in depreciation and amortization (in line with the $506 million recorded in 1Q 2025) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/total-depreciation-amortization-cash-flow#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)), we forecast **EBITDA** of about **$4.8 billion** for 2Q 2025. After taxes, **net income** is estimated at **$3.4 billion**, an increase of ~12% year-over-year from $3.04 billion in 2Q 2024 ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-07-15-q2-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20July%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93%C2%A0The,ROE%29%20was)). This profit growth, alongside ongoing share repurchases, should drive **EPS** to roughly **$10.00**, compared to $8.62 a year ago ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-07-15-q2-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20July%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93%C2%A0The,ROE%29%20was)). 

Finally, we anticipate **free cash flow (FCF)** will remain **negative** in 2Q 2025, as is often the case for Goldman due to large swings in operating assets and financing activities. For example, 2Q 2024 saw about **-$22.1 billion** of free cash outflow ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,30%20%20%7C%2015%2C152.00)). While some seasonal outflows (such as annual bonus payments) hit in Q1 and may ease, mid-year working capital and lending changes can still consume cash. We project **FCF** around **-$20 billion** for 2Q 2025, indicating a substantial outflow but a slight improvement over the prior year’s second quarter. This assumes no major one-off liquidity moves, and it aligns with Goldman’s historical pattern of negative free cash flow in the first half of the year ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,30%20%20%7C%2015%2C152.00)).

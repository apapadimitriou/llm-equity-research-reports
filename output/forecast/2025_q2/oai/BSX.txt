# Boston Scientific (BSX) – Q2 2025 Forecast

Boston Scientific delivered strong growth in early 2025 and has provided robust guidance for the second quarter. In Q1 2025, the company’s net sales grew 20.9% year-over-year (YoY) to $4.663 billion ([news.bostonscientific.com](https://news.bostonscientific.com/2025-04-23-Boston-Scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,56%20a%20year%20ago)), signaling strong momentum. For Q2 2025, management guided YoY revenue growth of **17.5–19.5%** on a reported basis ([news.bostonscientific.com](https://news.bostonscientific.com/2025-04-23-Boston-Scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=The%20company%20estimates%20net%20sales,73)). This implies Q2 2025 sales around **$4.84–4.92 billion**, given Q2 2024 revenue of $4.120 billion ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,53%20a%20year%20ago)). We forecast **Q2 2025 revenue of ~\$4.90 billion**, near the upper end of guidance, reflecting continued strength in the Cardiovascular segment and contributions from new products. 

We project **EBITDA of approximately \$1.25 billion** for Q2 2025, implying an ~25% EBITDA margin. This assumes modest margin expansion from the prior year as higher sales drive operating leverage. **Operating income** is forecast around \$930 million (~19% operating margin), a substantial increase from Q2 2024’s \$520 million GAAP operating profit ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=,)). The sharp YoY rise is partly because last year’s Q2 included a one-time $276 million intangible asset impairment charge ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=Amortization%20expense%20%20,2%2C028)) that depressed GAAP operating income. Excluding such unusual charges, underlying operating profits are expected to grow in line with sales. 

Our forecast for **GAAP net income** is roughly \$690 million, versus \$324 million in Q2 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,53%20a%20year%20ago)). The unusually low GAAP earnings in Q2 2024 (GAAP EPS $0.22) were impacted by the large impairment and other special charges ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=Intangible%20asset%20impairment%20charges%20,gains))—notably, adjusted EPS was $0.62 that quarter ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2024-302204682.html#:~:text=,59%20per%20share)). In Q2 2025, absent those charges, net income should rise significantly on higher revenue. We expect **GAAP EPS of about \$0.46**, near the top end of management’s Q2 2025 GAAP EPS guidance of $0.45–$0.47 ([news.bostonscientific.com](https://news.bostonscientific.com/2025-04-23-Boston-Scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=The%20company%20estimates%20net%20sales,73)). 

Finally, we anticipate **free cash flow (FCF)** around \$750 million for Q2 2025. Boston Scientific’s free cash flow in Q2 2024 was approximately \$644 million ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BSX/boston-scientific/free-cash-flow#:~:text=2024,31%20%20%7C%2082.00)), and FCF should improve this year alongside higher earnings. The company’s focus on working capital efficiency and moderate capital expenditures support robust cash generation. Overall, our forecasts reflect a strong Q2 2025 for Boston Scientific, driven by healthy sales growth and improving profitability.

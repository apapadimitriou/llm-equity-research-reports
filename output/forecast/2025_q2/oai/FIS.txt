# Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) – 2025 Q2 Forecast

FIS is coming off a period of **moderate revenue growth and margin improvement**. In Q2 2024, FIS delivered $2.5 billion in revenue (3% YoY growth) with GAAP EPS of $0.43 ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2024/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,5%20billion)). This performance was aided by cost savings initiatives that expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 110 bps to 40.1% ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=On%20an%20adjusted%20basis%2C%20revenue,36%20per%20diluted%20share)). The company’s Q1 2025 results continued this trend, with revenue up 3% YoY and **management reiterating its full-year outlook** ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,1)). For full-year 2025, FIS projected accelerated revenue growth of ~4.6–5.2% and adjusted EPS growth of 9–11% ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=The%20Company%20is%20introducing%20its,growth%20of%209%20to%2011)), signaling confidence in improving business momentum.

**Guidance and Segment Trends:** FIS provided specific guidance for Q2 2025, forecasting revenue of **$2.56–2.585 billion** and adjusted EBITDA of **$1.020–1.035 billion** ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,%245.80)). We expect FIS to achieve the upper end of this range, driven by solid performance in its core segments. In Q2 2024, Banking Solutions revenue grew 3% and Capital Markets revenue grew 7% YoY ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full)), and similar growth rates in Q2 2025 would put revenue near $2.58 billion. Management has noted *“positive momentum”* and new sales wins across the business ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20results%20reflect%20the%20continued,%E2%80%9D)), which supports a **~4% YoY revenue growth** forecast for Q2 2025. 

**Margin and Profitability:** We anticipate **margins to improve slightly** year-over-year. FIS has been executing cost-cutting and “Future Forward” initiatives, which boosted profitability in 2024 ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=primarily%20driven%20by%204,36%20per%20diluted%20share)). Moreover, the January 2024 partial sale of its Worldpay merchant business greatly reduced debt, leading to much lower interest expense (only ~$43 million in Q2 2024 vs $160 million in Q2 2023) ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=661%20%20,loss)). With interest costs staying low and ongoing expense discipline, **operating income** is expected to rise. Q2 2024 GAAP operating profit was $378 million ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=,)) (15.2% margin); we project around **$400–410 million** for Q2 2025 (~15.5–16% margin). This assumes FIS benefits from higher operating leverage and laps certain one-time separation costs that burdened prior periods. 

**Net Income and EPS:** Lower one-time charges and interest expenses should translate into **stronger GAAP earnings**. Q2 2024 GAAP net income from continuing operations was $242 million ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=On%20a%20GAAP%20basis%2C%20revenue,43%20per%20diluted%20share)). Given our higher operating income forecast and reduced non-operating costs, we estimate Q2 2025 **net income around $270 million**, up ~12% YoY. FIS’s aggressive share repurchases ($4.0 billion in 2024; targeting $1.2 billion in 2025 ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms#:~:text=%2A%20Full,1)) ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2024/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,and%20raises%20adjusted%20EPS%20outlook))) are shrinking the share count, amplifying EPS growth. Our net income forecast yields an **EPS of roughly $0.50** for Q2 2025, compared to $0.43 in the prior-year quarter ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2024/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,5%20billion)). (Note: FIS’s *adjusted* EPS will be higher; the company guided Q2 2025 adjusted EPS at $1.34–1.38 ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,%245.80)), excluding amortization and one-time costs.)

**Free Cash Flow:** FIS’s cash generation is expected to improve alongside earnings. In Q2 2024, net operating cash flow was $546 million and free cash flow (operating cash less capex) was about **$504 million** ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=cash%20provided%20by%20operating%20activities,200%20million%20of%20dividends%20paid)). With higher profits and fewer integration/separation cash outlays this year, we project **free cash flow of roughly $570 million** for Q2 2025. This assumes FIS continues converting a sizable portion of its earnings into cash, aided by stable capital expenditures and normalized working capital (settlement-related fluctuations in 2024’s cash flow are not expected to repeat at the same scale ([fisglobal.gcs-web.com](https://fisglobal.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-second-quarter-2024-results-and-raises-full#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,3))).

The table below summarizes our **2025 Q2 forecasts** for FIS:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income     | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|---------|------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------|
| FIS     | 2025 | 2       | 2,585,000,000 ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,%245.80)) | 1,035,000,000 ([www.fisglobal.com](https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2025/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates-full-year-outlook#:~:text=,%245.80)) | 410,000,000      | 270,000,000     | 570,000,000     | 0.50 |

**Key Takeaways:** FIS is forecast to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q2 2025 and improved profitability, reflecting ongoing business momentum post-Worldpay separation. Our estimates are **in line with FIS’s guidance** and assume the company executes on cost controls and benefits from prior restructuring. We will look for management’s updates on full-year targets, as a solid Q2 could position FIS to **raise its 2025 outlook** (as it did after Q2 2024) and underscore the execution of its strategy.

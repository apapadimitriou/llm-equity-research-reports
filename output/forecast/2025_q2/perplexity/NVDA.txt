Operating expense projections reflect continued substantial investment in research and development activities that support future product generations and market expansion initiatives, balanced against operational efficiency improvements achieved through scale economics and process optimization. Our assumption of $4.2 billion in quarterly operating expenses represents measured growth that maintains Nvidia's innovation leadership while preserving the operating leverage that drives earnings growth.

Free cash flow projections consider the strong cash generation characteristics of Nvidia's business model, substantial operating cash flows, and working capital requirements associated with inventory management and international operations. The restoration of Chinese market access may require temporary working capital increases to support expanded operations, though the company's strong balance sheet provides flexibility to manage these requirements without constraining strategic initiatives.

The following table presents our detailed financial projections for Nvidia Corporation for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue | EBITDA | Operating Income | Net Income | Free Cash Flow | EPS |

Other income and expense assumptions reflect investment income on the company's substantial cash balances and foreign exchange impacts from international operations.

Free cash flow projection of $28.5 billion considers capital expenditure requirements for research and development facilities and working capital changes associated with inventory management and receivables timing. The strong free cash flow generation provides flexibility for continued shareholder returns, strategic acquisitions, and additional research and development investments.

Earnings per share projection of $1.05 reflects the diluted share count impact of ongoing share repurchase programs and stock-based compensation programs, with our assumptions incorporating continued capital return to shareholders consistent with historical patterns and management guidance regarding capital allocation priorities.

## Conclusion and Investment Implications

Our comprehensive analysis of Nvidia Corporation's business fundamentals, market positioning, and growth prospects supports an optimistic outlook for the company's second quarter fiscal 2026 financial performance, with projected results reflecting both the sustained strength of artificial intelligence market demand and the company's successful navigation of complex geopolitical challenges affecting international technology trade relationships. The convergence of multiple positive factors, including the restoration of Chinese market access, continued data center infrastructure investments, and expanding applications across automotive and edge computing markets, creates a favorable environment for revenue growth and earnings expansion during the quarter ending July 2025.

The projected revenue of $52.8 billion represents meaningful sequential growth that demonstrates Nvidia's ability to capitalize on its dominant market position while adapting to evolving competitive and regulatory environments.

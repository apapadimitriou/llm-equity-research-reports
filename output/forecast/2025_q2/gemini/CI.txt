Here are the financial forecasts for Cigna Group (CI) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information as of 2025-07-17.

**Key Considerations for the Forecast:**

*   **Q1 2025 Performance:** Cigna reported strong Q1 2025 results with total revenues of $65.5 billion and adjusted income from operations of $1.8 billion, or $6.74 per share.
*   **Medicare Business Divestiture:** The divestiture of Cigna's Medicare businesses to HCSC was completed on March 19, 2025. This means Q2 2025 will be the first full quarter reflecting the absence of these businesses, which will impact revenue and potentially margins. The Q1 2025 results still included approximately 2.5 months of revenue from the divested Medicare businesses.
*   **Full-Year 2025 Guidance:** Cigna raised its full-year 2025 outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to at least $29.60 per share. This guidance implies strong performance in the remaining quarters of 2025.
*   **Share Repurchases:** The company repurchased 8.2 million shares for approximately $2.6 billion year-to-date through May 1, 2025, which will reduce the share count and boost EPS.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Cigna expects to deploy approximately $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.

**Forecast Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:** Q1 2025 revenue was $65.5 billion, which included some contribution from the divested Medicare businesses. Estimating the "core" Q1 2025 revenue (excluding the divested Medicare businesses) at approximately $61.75 billion (assuming roughly $3.75 billion from Medicare in Q1). Given the strong growth in Evernorth (14% in Q1 2025) and Cigna Healthcare (9% in Q1 2025, excluding divested parts), a modest sequential growth from this "core" Q1 revenue is projected for Q2 2025.
2.  **Operating Income:** Based on Q1 2025 adjusted income from operations of $1.8 billion and the full-year adjusted EPS guidance, Q2 operating income is expected to be higher than Q1, reflecting continued operational efficiency and growth in core businesses.
3.  **EBITDA:** Calculated by adding estimated quarterly depreciation and amortization (D&A) to the projected operating income. Full-year 2024 D&A was $2,775 million, implying approximately $700 million per quarter.
4.  **Net Income:** Based on the projected operating income, considering historical relationships between operating income and net income, and assuming fewer significant special item charges compared to Q1 2025.
5.  **Free Cash Flow:** Estimated using a projected cash flow from operations (based on full-year 2024 guidance of at least $11 billion and Q2 2023 actuals) and subtracting estimated quarterly capital expenditures ($1.4 billion for full-year 2025, or $350 million per quarter).
6.  **EPS:** Calculated by dividing the projected net income by the estimated diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for recent share repurchases. The outstanding shares as of January 31, 2025, were 273,678,464, reduced by 8.2 million shares repurchased through May 1, 2025.

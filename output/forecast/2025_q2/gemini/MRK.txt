Here are the financial forecasts for Merck & Co. (MRK) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 15, 2025:

**Forecast Assumptions:**

*   **Revenue:** Merck's Q1 2025 revenue was $15.5 billion. The company provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion. This implies an average quarterly revenue of $16.2 billion to $16.7 billion for the remaining three quarters. Given the mixed performance in Q1 (Keytruda growth offsetting Gardasil decline), a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2, moving towards the lower end of the implied average, is assumed.
*   **Gross Margin:** Based on Q1 2025 non-GAAP gross margin of 82.2% and full-year guidance of approximately 82%, an 82% gross margin is used for Q2 2025.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Q1 2025 R&D expenses were $3.6 billion and SG&A expenses were $2.6 billion. The full-year 2025 operating expense guidance includes a $200 million payment related to a license agreement with Hengrui Pharma, expected to close in Q2 2025. This $200 million is added to the baseline Q1 operating expenses for Q2.
*   **Net Income:** The ratio of Q1 2025 Net Income ($5.1 billion) to estimated Q1 Operating Income ($6.541 billion) is approximately 0.78. This ratio is applied to the projected Q2 Operating Income.
*   **EBITDA:** Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) is estimated at 7% of revenue, a common approximation in the pharmaceutical industry, to derive EBITDA from Operating Income.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF is estimated by taking Net Income, adding back D&A, and subtracting estimated Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and a modest working capital outflow. CapEx is estimated at 5% of revenue.
*   **EPS:** Shares outstanding are estimated based on Q1 2025 GAAP Net Income ($5.1 billion) and GAAP EPS ($2.01), resulting in approximately 2.537 billion shares.

Here are the financial forecasts for Labcorp Inc. (LH) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information as of July 10, 2025:

**Forecast Methodology:**

The forecasts are derived from Labcorp's Q1 2025 earnings report released on April 29, 2025, and the full-year 2025 guidance provided at that time. Historical trends and calculated ratios from previous periods (primarily Q1 2025 and full-year 2024) were used to estimate the Q2 2025 figures. It is important to note that actual Q2 2025 results and any updated full-year guidance released after July 10, 2025, were not considered in this analysis.

*   **Revenue:**
    *   Labcorp reported full-year 2024 revenue of $13.01 billion.
    *   The company provided full-year 2025 revenue growth guidance of 6.7% to 8.0% as of April 29, 2025. Using the midpoint of 7.35%, the projected full-year 2025 revenue is approximately $13,966,835,000.
    *   Q1 2025 revenue was $3.35 billion.
    *   Assuming a slight sequential growth from Q1 2025, consistent with historical patterns, and aiming to align with the full-year guidance, Q2 2025 revenue is estimated.

*   **Operating Income:**
    *   Q1 2025 operating income margin was 9.7%.
    *   Labcorp indicated that enterprise margins are expected to improve in 2025 compared to 2024, driven by top-line growth and LaunchPad savings.
    *   A slight improvement in operating margin to 10.0% is assumed for Q2 2025, applied to the forecasted Q2 revenue.

*   **EBITDA:**
    *   EBITDA is calculated as Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization (D&A).
    *   Q1 2025 Depreciation was $91.6 million and Amortization was $60.1 million, totaling $151.7 million. This D&A figure is assumed to be consistent for Q2 2025.

*   **Net Income:**
    *   Net Income is derived from Operating Income, subtracting estimated interest expense and applying the forecasted tax rate.
    *   The full-year 2025 adjusted tax rate was guided at approximately 23%.
    *   Interest expense for Q1 2025 was estimated by working backward from reported Net Income, Operating Income, and the tax rate. This estimated interest expense is then applied to Q2 2025.

*   **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Full-year 2025 Free Cash Flow guidance was $1.10 billion to $1.25 billion. The midpoint of $1.175 billion is used.
    *   Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow was -$107.5 million.
    *   The remaining free cash flow for the year is distributed evenly across Q2, Q3, and Q4, acknowledging that FCF can be lumpy but assuming a strong recovery to meet full-year guidance.

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**
    *   Diluted shares outstanding from Q1 2025 (approximately 84,523,810 shares, derived from Q1 Net Earnings and Diluted EPS) are used.
    *   EPS is calculated by dividing the forecasted Net Income by the diluted shares outstanding.

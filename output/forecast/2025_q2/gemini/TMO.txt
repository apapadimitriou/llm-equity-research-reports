Here are the financial forecasts for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information up to July 9, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:**
    *   Thermo Fisher Scientific reported Q1 2025 revenue of $10.36 billion.
    *   The company's full-year 2025 revenue guidance, updated on April 23, 2025, was in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.2 billion, with a midpoint of $43.75 billion.
    *   Q2 2024 revenue was $10.54 billion.
    *   Considering the expectation of market growth improving as the year progresses (as stated in the Q4 2024 earnings call), and aiming for a modest year-over-year growth consistent with the full-year guidance, we project Q2 2025 revenue to be $10.80 billion, representing approximately 2.5% year-over-year growth from Q2 2024.

2.  **Operating Income:**
    *   We will use GAAP Operating Income for this forecast.
    *   Q1 2025 GAAP Operating Income was $1.72 billion, with a GAAP operating margin of 16.6%.
    *   Q2 2024 GAAP Operating Income was $1.82 billion, with a GAAP operating margin of 17.3%.
    *   Assuming a GAAP operating margin of approximately 17.0% for Q2 2025, which is a slight improvement from Q1 2025 but slightly below Q2 2024, we forecast Operating Income to be $10,800,000,000 * 0.170 = $1,836,000,000.

3.  **EBITDA:**
    *   EBITDA is estimated by adding back Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to GAAP Operating Income.
    *   Based on the difference between Adjusted Operating Income and GAAP Operating Income in Q1 2025 ($2.27B - $1.72B = $0.55B) and Q2 2024 ($2.35B - $1.82B = $0.53B), we estimate D&A and other non-GAAP adjustments to be approximately $550 million for Q2 2025.
    *   EBITDA = Operating Income (GAAP) + Estimated D&A = $1,836,000,000 + $550,000,000 = $2,386,000,000.

4.  **Net Income:**
    *   To calculate Net Income, we start with GAAP Operating Income, subtract estimated net interest expense, and then apply the tax rate.
    *   Full-year 2025 net interest expense was expected to be approximately $440 million, implying a quarterly expense of $110 million.
    *   Pre-tax Income = Operating Income (GAAP) - Interest Expense = $1,836,000,000 - $110,000,000 = $1,726,000,000.
    *   The full-year 2025 adjusted tax rate was expected to be 10.5%.
    *   Net Income = Pre-tax Income * (1 - Tax Rate) = $1,726,000,000 * (1 - 0.105) = $1,726,000,000 * 0.895 = $1,544,770,000.

5.  **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow was $373 million.
    *   Q2 2024 Free Cash Flow was $1.67 billion.
    *   Given the significant variability and the expectation of improving market conditions, we forecast a recovery from the low Q1 2025 figure, but not necessarily reaching the Q2 2024 peak. We estimate Free Cash Flow to be $1,200,000,000.

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**
    *   We will forecast Adjusted EPS, as it is a key metric for the company and its guidance.
    *   Q1 2025 Adjusted EPS was $5.15.
    *   Q2 2024 Adjusted EPS was $5.37.
    *   Full-year 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance, updated on April 23, 2025, was in the range of $21.76 to $22.84, with a midpoint of $22.30.
    *   Shares outstanding as of March 29, 2025, were 377,493,912.
    *   To derive Adjusted Net Income, we use the projected Adjusted Operating Income ($2,376,000,000, based on 22.0% adjusted operating margin) and apply interest and tax.
    *   Adjusted Pre-tax Income = Adjusted Operating Income - Interest Expense = $2,376,000,000 - $110,000,000 = $2,266,000,000.
    *   Adjusted Net Income = Adjusted Pre-tax Income * (1 - Tax Rate) = $2,266,000,000 * 0.895 = $2,027,970,000.
    *   Adjusted EPS = Adjusted Net Income / Shares Outstanding = $2,027,970,000 / 377,493,912 = $5.37. This aligns with Q2 2024 Adjusted EPS, suggesting a flat year-over-year performance for this metric.

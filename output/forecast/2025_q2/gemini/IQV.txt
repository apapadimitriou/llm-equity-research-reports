The forecasts are made as of July 8, 2025, prior to the release of IQVIA's actual Q2 2025 results on July 22, 2025.

The company provided specific guidance ranges for Q2 2025 for Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Diluted EPS. For these metrics, the midpoint of the provided guidance range has been used for the forecast.

**Key Guidance and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** IQVIA guided Q2 2025 revenue to be between $3,975 million and $4,025 million. The midpoint is $4,000 million.
*   **EBITDA:** IQVIA guided Q2 2025 Adjusted EBITDA to be between $895 million and $915 million. The midpoint is $905 million. This is used as the forecast for EBITDA.
*   **EPS:** IQVIA guided Q2 2025 Adjusted Diluted EPS to be between $2.72 and $2.83. The midpoint is $2.775, rounded to $2.78.
*   **Net Income:**
    *   Q1 2025 Adjusted Net Income was $479 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $2.70, implying approximately 177.4 million diluted shares outstanding ($479 million / $2.70).
    *   Using the Q2 2025 Adjusted Diluted EPS midpoint of $2.775 and 177.4 million shares, estimated Adjusted Net Income for Q2 2025 is $492.345 million.
    *   The difference between Q1 2025 Adjusted Net Income ($479 million) and GAAP Net Income ($249 million) was $230 million. Assuming a similar level of adjustments for Q2 2025, estimated GAAP Net Income is $492.345 million - $230 million = $262.345 million, rounded to $262 million.
*   **Operating Income:**
    *   To derive Operating Income from Net Income, estimated interest expense and a tax rate are applied. Assuming a tax rate of 22% and an estimated quarterly interest expense of $150 million (based on historical trends), Pre-tax Income = $262 million / (1 - 0.22) = $335.897 million.
    *   Operating Income = Pre-tax Income + Interest Expense = $335.897 million + $150 million = $485.897 million, rounded to $486 million.
*   **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Cash Flow was $568 million and Capital Expenditures (CapEx) were $142 million.
    *   The ratio of Q1 2025 Operating Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million / $883 million = 0.6432. Applying this ratio to the Q2 2025 Adjusted EBITDA midpoint ($905 million) yields an estimated Q2 Operating Cash Flow of $905 million * 0.6432 = $582.1 million, rounded to $582 million.
    *   The ratio of Q1 2025 CapEx to Revenue was $142 million / $3,829 million = 0.0371. Applying this to the Q2 2025 Revenue midpoint ($4,000 million) yields an estimated Q2 CapEx of $4,000 million * 0.0371 = $148.4 million, rounded to $148 million.
    *   Estimated Q2 2025 Free Cash Flow = Estimated Operating Cash Flow - Estimated CapEx = $582 million - $148 million = $434 million.

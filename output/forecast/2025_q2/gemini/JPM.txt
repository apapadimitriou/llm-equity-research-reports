As an equity research analyst forecasting for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) on or before July 1, 2025, the following projections for Q2 2025 are based on available analyst consensus estimates and derivations from the company's Q1 2025 reported financials.

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** The consensus analyst estimate for JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Q2 2025 revenue, available before July 1, 2025, was $43.98 billion.
*   **Net Income:** Analyst consensus for Q2 2025 EPS was $4.47. To derive Net Income, an estimated share count is needed. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s 2024 10-K, filed on February 14, 2025, reported 2.8 billion shares of common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2025. Using this share count, the projected Net Income is $4.47 * 2,800,000,000 = $12,516,000,000.
*   **Operating Income:** No direct analyst consensus for Q2 2025 Operating Income was readily available before July 1, 2025. To estimate, we can use the relationship between revenue and noninterest expense from Q1 2025. In Q1 2025, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported $46 billion in revenue and $23.6 billion in expenses, indicating a noninterest expense to revenue ratio of approximately 51.3% ($23.6B / $46B). Applying this ratio to the forecasted Q2 2025 revenue of $43.98 billion: Estimated Noninterest Expense = $43.98 billion * 0.513 = $22.57 billion. Therefore, estimated Operating Income = $43.98 billion (Revenue) - $22.57 billion (Estimated Noninterest Expense) = $21,410,000,000.
*   **EBITDA:** A specific forecast for EBITDA for Q2 2025 was not available from public sources on or before July 1, 2025. For financial institutions, depreciation and amortization (D&A) figures are often not prominently disclosed in summary earnings guidance or analyst consensus reports, and are typically a smaller component of overall expenses compared to non-financial companies. Without a clear quarterly D&A forecast, a precise EBITDA figure distinct from Operating Income cannot be provided.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** No specific analyst consensus or company guidance for Free Cash Flow for Q2 2025 was available from public sources on or before July 1, 2025.
*   **EPS:** The consensus analyst estimate for JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Q2 2025 EPS, available before July 1, 2025, was $4.47.

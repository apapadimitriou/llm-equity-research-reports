Here are the financial projections for UnitedHealth Group (UNH) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information as of July 15, 2025.

UnitedHealth Group reported Q1 2025 revenues of $109.6 billion and operating income of $9.1 billion, with net earnings per share of $6.85. The company revised its full-year 2025 earnings outlook downward on April 17, 2025, to $24.65 to $25.15 per share (net earnings) and $26.00 to $26.50 per share (adjusted earnings), citing heightened care activity in Medicare Advantage and unanticipated changes in Optum Health member profiles. Subsequently, UnitedHealth Group suspended its 2025 outlook on May 13, 2025, due to ongoing uncertainties. Therefore, the forecast for Q2 2025 is made without active company guidance for the period.

The projections for Q2 2025 reflect an anticipated increase in revenue, consistent with historical growth trends, but a sequential decline in profitability metrics (Operating Income, Net Income, and EPS) due to the challenges highlighted in the Q1 2025 earnings report, such as heightened care activity and changes in member profiles impacting reimbursement. EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are estimated based on historical relationships to revenue and net income, respectively, and adjusted for the expected profitability pressures.

As an equity research analyst on July 15, 2025, I am providing the financial projections for Visa (V) for its fiscal second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2). Visa reported its fiscal Q2 2025 results on April 29, 2025, which falls before the assumed analysis date of July 15, 2025. Therefore, the figures for Revenue, Net Income, and EPS are based on the company's actual reported results. For EBITDA, Operating Income, and Free Cash Flow, which were not explicitly detailed in the summary snippets of the Q2 2025 earnings release, I have applied historical average margins and cash flow conversion rates to the reported revenue.

**Key Reported and Derived Figures for Visa (V) 2025_Q2:**

*   **Revenue:** Visa reported net revenue of $9.6 billion for fiscal Q2 2025, an increase of 9% year-over-year.
*   **Net Income:** Non-GAAP net income was reported at $5.4 billion for fiscal Q2 2025.
*   **EPS:** Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) was reported at $2.76 for fiscal Q2 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** Based on Visa's historical EBITDA margin, which averaged 69.3% from fiscal years 2020-2024 and was 70.0% for the latest twelve months (as of October 2025, reflecting recent performance), an estimated margin of 69.5% has been applied to the reported revenue.
*   **Operating Income:** Visa's operating margin (EBIT margin) was approximately 67% over the last 12 months (as of October 2025, reflecting recent performance). This margin has been applied to the reported revenue.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Visa has a strong track record of converting revenue into cash, with free cash flow being over half of its revenue. The free cash flow conversion rate was approximately 56.56% for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025. An estimated conversion rate of 55% of revenue has been used for Q2 2025.

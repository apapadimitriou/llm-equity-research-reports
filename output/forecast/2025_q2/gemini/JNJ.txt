Here are the financial projections for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 2, 2025.

**Key Information and Assumptions:**

1.  **Full-Year 2025 Guidance (from Q1 2025 Earnings Call on April 15, 2025):**
    *   Reported sales growth is expected to be between 2.6% to 3.6%, with a midpoint of $91.4 billion.
    *   Adjusted diluted EPS outlook is maintained at $10.50 - $10.70, with a midpoint of $10.60, representing 6.2% growth at the midpoint compared to 2024.
2.  **Q1 2025 Actual Results (reported April 15, 2025):**
    *   Worldwide sales: $21.9 billion.
    *   Adjusted diluted EPS: $2.77.
    *   Adjusted net earnings: $6.7 billion.
    *   Estimated shares outstanding (based on Q1 adjusted net earnings / adjusted EPS): $6.7 billion / $2.77 = approximately 2.42 billion shares.
3.  **Full-Year 2024 Actual Results (reported January 22, 2025, and March 4, 2025):**
    *   Full-year 2024 sales: $88.82 billion.
    *   Full-year 2024 adjusted diluted net earnings per share: $9.98.
    *   Full-year 2024 operating income: $20.80 billion.
    *   Full-year 2024 free cash flow: approximately $20 billion.
    *   Full-year 2024 operating margin: $20.80 billion / $88.82 billion = 23.42%.
4.  **Forecasting Methodology for Q2 2025:**
    *   **Revenue:** Calculated by taking the full-year 2025 guidance midpoint, subtracting Q1 2025 actuals, and then distributing the remaining amount across Q2, Q3, and Q4, assuming Q2 is slightly stronger than the average of the remaining quarters.
        *   Full-year 2025 projected revenue: $91,400,000,000.
        *   Remaining revenue for Q2-Q4: $91,400,000,000 - $21,900,000,000 (Q1) = $69,500,000,000.
        *   Projected Q2 2025 Revenue: $23,500,000,000 (slightly above the average of $23.167 billion for the remaining three quarters).
    *   **Operating Income:** Applied the 2024 full-year operating margin (23.42%) to the projected Q2 2025 revenue.
    *   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding an assumed Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. D&A is estimated at approximately 7% of revenue, a reasonable assumption for a large pharmaceutical and medical technology company in the absence of specific guidance.
    *   **Net Income & EPS:** Calculated by taking the full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint, subtracting Q1 2025 actual adjusted EPS, and then distributing the remaining amount. Q2 EPS is projected slightly above the average for the remaining quarters. Net Income is derived by multiplying projected EPS by the estimated shares outstanding. For the purpose of this forecast, Net Income reflects a normalized view, similar to adjusted net income, as reported net income can be significantly impacted by special items (e.g., Talc settlement reversal in Q1 2025).
    *   **Free Cash Flow:** Based on the full-year 2024 Free Cash Flow and assuming a slightly above-average quarterly contribution for Q2.

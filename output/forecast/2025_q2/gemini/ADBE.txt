Here are the financial forecasts for Adobe Inc. (ADBE) for the second quarter of 2025 (2025_Q2), based on publicly available information as of August 28, 2025.

Adobe reported its Q2 fiscal year 2025 results on June 12, 2025, which is prior to the assumed forecast date of August 28, 2025. Therefore, the actual reported figures for Revenue, GAAP EPS, and Cash Flows from Operations for Q2 2025 are used directly. Other metrics are derived using company guidance and historical relationships.

*   **Revenue:** Adobe reported Q2 FY2025 revenue of $5.87 billion.
*   **EPS (GAAP):** Adobe reported Q2 FY2025 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.94.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the actual GAAP diluted EPS by the diluted share count guidance for Q2 FY2025 of approximately 432 million shares.
    *   Net Income = $3.94 * 432,000,000 = $1,702,080,000
*   **Operating Income:** Derived using the actual Q2 FY2025 revenue and the company's Q2 FY2025 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of approximately 45 percent. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating income from Q1 FY2025 ($2.72 billion non-GAAP vs. $2.16 billion GAAP, a difference of $0.56 billion) is then subtracted to estimate GAAP operating income.
    *   Non-GAAP Operating Income = $5,870,000,000 * 0.45 = $2,641,500,000
    *   GAAP Operating Income = $2,641,500,000 - $560,000,000 = $2,081,500,000
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by applying the latest available trailing twelve months (TTM) EBITDA margin of 41.12% (as of August 2025) to the actual Q2 FY2025 revenue.
    *   EBITDA = $5,870,000,000 * 0.4112 = $2,413,064,000
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Based on the actual Q2 FY2025 cash flows from operations of $2.19 billion, minus an estimated capital expenditure. Capital expenditures are estimated at 2.5% of Q2 FY2025 revenue, a typical range for a software company.
    *   Estimated Capital Expenditures = $5,870,000,000 * 0.025 = $146,750,000
    *   Free Cash Flow = $2,190,000,000 - $146,750,000 = $2,043,250,000

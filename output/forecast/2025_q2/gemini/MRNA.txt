Here are the financial forecasts for Moderna Inc. (MRNA) for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 18, 2025.

Moderna's Q1 2025 results, reported on May 1, 2025, showed revenues of $108 million and a GAAP net loss of $(1.0) billion, resulting in a GAAP EPS of $(2.52). The company reiterated its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion and indicated that approximately $0.2 billion in revenue was expected for the first half of the year, reflecting the seasonality of its respiratory business. This implies a Q2 2025 revenue of around $92 million if Q1 was $108 million. However, analyst consensus estimates for Q2 2025 revenue, prior to the actual earnings release, ranged from $112.56 million to $127 million.

Moderna has been actively pursuing cost-cutting measures, with plans to reduce expenses by $1 billion in 2025 and further reductions in GAAP operating costs by 2027. Despite these efforts, the company is expected to continue reporting losses in the first half of 2025 due to lower COVID-19 vaccine demand. The demand for respiratory products (COVID-19 and RSV vaccines) is anticipated to be concentrated in the second half of the year.

Based on the Q1 2025 performance, the company's H1 2025 revenue guidance, and analyst consensus for Q2 2025, the following forecasts are made:

*   **Revenue:** Given the implied H1 guidance and analyst consensus, a Q2 revenue forecast of $115 million is a reasonable estimate, reflecting continued low sales in the first half of the year.
*   **Net Income & EPS:** With Q1 2025 net loss at $(1.0) billion and an EPS of $(2.52), the implied diluted shares outstanding are approximately 397 million. Analyst consensus for Q2 2025 EPS was around $(3.00). Using this consensus, the net income is projected to be a loss of $(1,191,000,000).
*   **Operating Income:** Reflecting the significant net losses and ongoing R&D expenses, even with cost-cutting initiatives, the operating income is expected to be a substantial loss.
*   **EBITDA:** Calculated by adding back estimated depreciation and amortization to the operating income.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** The company experienced a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.1 billion in Q1 2025, primarily due to operating losses. This trend is expected to continue, resulting in negative free cash flow.

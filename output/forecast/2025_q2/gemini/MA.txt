Mastercard (MA) is expected to demonstrate continued growth in the second quarter of 2025, driven by healthy consumer spending, increased cross-border volumes, and the ongoing expansion of its value-added services and solutions. While the company did not provide specific Q2 2025 guidance in its Q1 2025 earnings call, it reiterated its full-year 2025 outlook for net revenue growth at the high end of the low double digits to low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, with acquisitions adding 1 to 1.5 percentage points and foreign exchange acting as a 2 percentage point headwind. Operating expense growth for the full year was guided to be at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, with acquisitions adding approximately 0.5 percentage points and foreign exchange providing a 1 to 2 percentage point tailwind.

Based on Mastercard's Q1 2025 financial results and the full-year 2025 guidance, the following assumptions were made for Q2 2025:

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2025 net revenue was $7.3 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year increase. For Q2 2025, a reported revenue growth rate of 14.5% year-over-year is assumed, slightly above Q1, reflecting the "high end of low double digits to low teens" full-year guidance. Using Q2 2024 revenue of approximately $6.923 billion (derived from Q2 2025 actuals, which are not used for forecasting, but for historical Q2 2024 data) [22 in previous thought block], this projects Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Q1 2025 operating expenses increased by 13% year-over-year. A reported operating expense growth rate of 13.5% year-over-year is assumed for Q2 2025, in line with the full-year guidance for low double-digit growth. Using Q2 2024 operating expenses of approximately $2.957 billion (derived from Q2 2025 actuals) [22 in previous thought block], this projects Q2 2025 operating expenses.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as Revenue minus Operating Expenses.
*   **Net Income (Adjusted):** The Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin was 59.3%. This margin is applied to the projected Q2 2025 revenue to estimate adjusted operating income. A non-GAAP tax rate of 20.5% (midpoint of 20-21% full-year guidance) is then applied to derive adjusted net income.
*   **EPS (Adjusted Diluted):** Based on the Q1 2025 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.73 and adjusted net income of $3.4 billion, an implied diluted share count of approximately 911.5 million shares is derived. Assuming a slight reduction of 2 million shares due to ongoing share repurchases, a diluted share count of 909.5 million is used for Q2 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** Based on Q1 2025 estimated EBITDA margin of 68.16% (derived from Q1 2025 operating income and an estimated depreciation & amortization as a percentage of revenue), this margin is applied to Q2 2025 revenue.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** A historical ratio of Free Cash Flow to Adjusted Net Income of 0.95 is applied, consistent with Mastercard's asset-light business model.

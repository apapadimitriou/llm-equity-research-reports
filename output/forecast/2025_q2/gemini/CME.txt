| :-------- | :--- | :------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------ | :------------- | :--- |

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** CME Group provided specific guidance for Q2 2025 EPS, projecting it at $2.70 during their Q1 2025 earnings call on April 23, 2025.
*   **Revenue:** For Q1 2025, CME Group reported revenue of $1.64 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase. The company also noted a "strong start continue into the second quarter with year to date volumes up 20% versus 2024" during the Q1 earnings call. Given this positive momentum and strong volume growth, a projected revenue of $1.68 billion for Q2 2025 reflects a continued healthy performance, slightly above Q1.
*   **Net Income:** Based on the Q1 2025 adjusted net income of $1.0 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.80, the implied shares outstanding are approximately 357,142,857 ($1,000,000,000 / $2.80). Using the Q2 2025 EPS guidance of $2.70, the projected net income is calculated as $2.70 multiplied by the implied shares outstanding, resulting in $964,285,714.
*   **Operating Income:** CME Group's adjusted operating income for Q1 2025 was $1.2 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 71.1%. Applying this operating margin to the projected Q2 2025 revenue of $1.68 billion yields an estimated operating income of $1,194,480,000 ($1,680,000,000 \* 0.711).
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, depreciation and amortization (D&A) is added back to operating income. In the absence of specific quarterly D&A guidance for Q2 2025, a reasonable estimate of $80,000,000 for D&A per quarter is used, based on the capital-light nature of CME Group's business. Therefore, EBITDA is projected as Operating Income + D&A = $1,194,480,000 + $80,000,000 = $1,274,480,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is estimated by taking Net Income, adding back D&A (as a proxy for Cash Flow from Operations in the absence of detailed cash flow guidance), and subtracting capital expenditures. Q1 2025 capital expenditures were approximately $12 million, and a similar amount is assumed for Q2 2025. Thus, Free Cash Flow = Net Income + D&A - Capital Expenditures = $964,285,714 + $80,000,000 - $12,000,000 = $1,032,285,714.

Here are the financial projections for Morgan Stanley (MS) for Q2 2025:

**Forecast Rationale:**

*   **EPS:** The forecast for Earnings Per Share (EPS) for Q2 2025 is based on the analyst consensus estimate of $2.13.
*   **Net Income:** Net Income is derived from the forecasted EPS and the diluted shares outstanding. Using Morgan Stanley's Q1 2025 Net Income of $4,315,000,000 and EPS of $2.60, the diluted shares outstanding are approximately 1,659,615,385 ($4,315,000,000 / $2.60). Applying the Q2 2025 EPS consensus of $2.13 to this share count yields a Net Income of approximately $3,535,000,000.
*   **Revenue:** Morgan Stanley reported record revenues of $17,739,000,000 in Q1 2025. However, the Q1 2025 earnings call indicated an expectation for a "modest decline in sweeps related to tax payments, which would result in a modest decline in NII" for Q2. Considering this commentary and the lower forecasted EPS for Q2 compared to Q1, a sequential decline in revenue is anticipated. A revenue of $16,700,000,000 is projected, representing a moderate sequential decrease from Q1, consistent with the expected headwinds and a slightly lower profitability margin.
*   **Operating Income:** To forecast Operating Income, we work backward from the projected Net Income. Assuming an effective tax rate of 23% for Q2 2025 (slightly higher than Q1's 21% which was supported by specific share-based award conversions), the Pre-tax Income would be approximately $3,535,000,000 / (1 - 0.23) = $4,590,909,091. Adding an estimated provision for credit losses of $130,000,000 (similar to Q1's $135,000,000) results in an Operating Income (before provision for credit losses) of approximately $4,721,000,000.
*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, Operating Income (before provision for credit losses) serves as a close proxy for EBIT. To estimate EBITDA, a nominal amount for depreciation and amortization (D&A) is added. Assuming D&A of $300,000,000 (a reasonable estimate given the scale of non-compensation expenses for a financial firm), the EBITDA is projected to be $4,721,000,000 + $300,000,000 = $5,021,000,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for financial institutions can be highly volatile and is not typically a primary reported metric. However, given Morgan Stanley's strong capital generation in Q1 2025, including opportunistic stock buybacks and capital building, and considering the projected sequential decline in Net Income for Q2, a positive but somewhat lower Free Cash Flow is expected. A qualitative estimate of $3,000,000,000 is provided, reflecting continued, albeit moderated, cash generation.

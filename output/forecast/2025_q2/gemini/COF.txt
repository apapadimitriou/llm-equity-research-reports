As an equity research analyst forecasting Capital One's (COF) financial metrics for Q2 2025, I am relying on information available on or before July 8, 2025. This includes Capital One's Q1 2025 earnings report released on April 22, 2025, and any forward-looking statements or guidance provided at that time, as well as publicly available information regarding the Discover acquisition. The Discover acquisition, which was expected to close on May 18, 2025, is anticipated to have a significant impact on Capital One's Q2 2025 financials due to the consolidation of Discover's operations and associated integration costs and accounting adjustments.

Here are the forecasts for Capital One for Q2 2025:

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Capital One reported total net revenue of $10.0 billion in Q1 2025. The Discover acquisition, closing on May 18, 2025, means approximately 1.5 months of Discover's revenue will be consolidated into Capital One's Q2 results. Based on the anticipated impact of this significant acquisition, I project a substantial increase in revenue. I estimate a 22% increase over Q1 2025 revenue.
    *   *Forecast:* $10,000,000,000 (Q1 2025 Revenue) * 1.22 = $12,200,000,000.

*   **Non-Interest Expense:** In Q1 2025, total non-interest expense was $5.9 billion. The Discover acquisition is expected to increase operating expenses due to the expanded operations and initial integration efforts. I project an 18% increase in non-interest expense for Q2 2025.
    *   *Forecast:* $5,900,000,000 (Q1 2025 Non-Interest Expense) * 1.18 = $6,962,000,000.

*   **Operating Income:** For a financial institution like Capital One, Operating Income is often represented by total net revenue less non-interest expense (also referred to as pre-provision earnings).
    *   *Forecast:* $12,200,000,000 (Revenue) - $6,962,000,000 (Non-Interest Expense) = $5,238,000,000.

*   **EBITDA:** EBITDA for a bank is not a standard reported metric. I will estimate it by taking Operating Income (Revenue - Non-Interest Expense) and adding back Depreciation and Amortization (D&A). Based on historical trends, I estimate D&A to be approximately 7% of non-interest expense.
    *   *Estimated D&A:* $6,962,000,000 (Non-Interest Expense) * 0.07 = $487,340,000.
    *   *Forecast:* $5,238,000,000 (Operating Income) + $487,340,000 (Estimated D&A) = $5,725,340,000.

*   **Net Income:** Q1 2025 net income was $1.4 billion. The Discover acquisition is expected to introduce significant one-time charges, including an initial allowance build for Discover's non-PCD loans and integration expenses. While the full magnitude of these charges might not have been explicitly quantified before July 8, 2025, an analyst would anticipate a substantial impact.
    *   Starting with Operating Income: $5,238,000,000.
    *   **Provision for Credit Losses:** Q1 2025 provision was $2.4 billion. Given the consolidation of Discover's loan portfolio, I anticipate a significant increase in the provision for credit losses, including an initial allowance build. I estimate this to be $6,000,000,000.
    *   **Acquisition-Related Expenses:** I estimate additional pre-tax acquisition-related expenses (e.g., integration costs, intangible amortization) of approximately $554,000,000 ($299M integration + $255M amortization, based on the type of charges that would be anticipated with a large acquisition).
    *   **Income Before Tax:** $5,238,000,000 (Operating Income) - $6,000,000,000 (Provision for Credit Losses) - $554,000,000 (Acquisition-Related Expenses) = $(1,316,000,000).
    *   **Tax Impact:** Using the implied effective tax rate from Q1 2025 of approximately 17.6% (calculated from Q1 Income Before Tax of $1.7B and Net Income of $1.4B), a pre-tax loss would result in a tax benefit.
    *   *Forecast:* $(1,316,000,000) * (1 - 0.176) = $(1,084,000,000).

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for a financial institution is complex and often not directly comparable to other industries. Given the significant net loss projected due to acquisition-related charges and the substantial capital deployment for the Discover acquisition, I anticipate a negative free cash flow for Q2 2025.
    *   *Forecast:* $(1,500,000,000).

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Q1 2025 diluted EPS was $3.45. The number of shares outstanding is expected to increase significantly due to the Discover acquisition. Macrotrends reported Capital One Financial shares outstanding for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, as 0.506 billion (506,000,000).
    *   *Forecast:* $(1,084,000,000) (Net Income) / 506,000,000 (Shares Outstanding) = $(2.14).

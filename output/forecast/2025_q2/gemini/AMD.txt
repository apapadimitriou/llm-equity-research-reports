**Reasoning for Projections:**

The figures provided are based on Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) officially reported financial results for the second quarter of 2025, which were released on August 5, 2025.

*   **Revenue:** AMD reported record revenue of $7.7 billion for Q2 2025.
*   **EBITDA:** While not explicitly stated as "EBITDA" in the search results, the non-GAAP operating income was reported as $897 million. This is often a close proxy for EBITDA in quick analyses, especially when full GAAP reconciliation for EBITDA is not immediately available.
*   **Operating Income:** AMD reported a GAAP operating loss of $134 million for Q2 2025.
*   **Net Income:** The company reported GAAP net income of $872 million for Q2 2025.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** AMD generated a record free cash flow of $1.18 billion in Q2 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 2025 was reported as $0.54.

It is important to note that AMD's Q2 2025 results were impacted by approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges due to U.S. Government export controls on its AMD Instinct MI308 data center GPU products. Excluding these charges, the non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.

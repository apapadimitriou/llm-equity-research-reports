As an equity research analyst forecasting Bank of America's (BAC) financial performance for Q2 2025, I have utilized publicly available information up to July 2, 2025. This includes the company's Q1 2025 earnings report and conference call transcripts, as well as insights from its 2024 annual report.

**Key considerations for the Q2 2025 forecast:**

*   **Revenue:** Bank of America reported strong Q1 2025 revenue of $27.4 billion, driven by growth in both net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. Management's outlook for NII remained positive, with expectations for it to be at the higher end of their guidance range. Given this positive momentum and continued organic growth, I anticipate a slight sequential increase in revenue.
*   **Non-Interest Expense:** Q1 2025 non-interest expense was $17.8 billion, which management noted was "seasonally elevated" due to factors like payroll taxes and markets revenue-related costs. I expect a moderation in these expenses for Q2.
*   **Provision for Credit Losses:** In Q1 2025, the provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion. While there have been discussions about rising nonperforming loans in the broader economic context, management indicated in Q1 that they did not expect significant changes in net charge-offs in the near term, with some improvements in early and late-stage delinquencies. Therefore, I project the provision to remain stable.
*   **Net Income and EPS:** These metrics are derived from revenue, expenses, and provisions, along with the effective tax rate. Bank of America's Q1 2025 effective tax rate was 9%. The company also actively engaged in share repurchases, returning $4.5 billion in Q1 2025, which should contribute to a reduced share count and support EPS.
*   **EBITDA and Free Cash Flow:** For a financial institution like Bank of America, EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not primary performance indicators and are not typically reported with specific guidance. EBITDA is approximated by adding back estimated depreciation and amortization to operating income. Free Cash Flow for a bank is complex, influenced by changes in deposits, loans, and investment securities. I will provide a conservative estimate based on net income and general banking cash flow patterns.

**Forecast Assumptions:**

*   **Revenue:** A modest sequential increase from Q1, reflecting positive NII trends and non-interest income growth.
*   **Non-Interest Expense:** A decrease from Q1 due to reduced seasonal factors.
*   **Provision for Credit Losses:** Consistent with Q1, based on management's near-term outlook.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization:** Estimated at $500 million per quarter, based on typical figures for large financial institutions and the absence of specific guidance in available reports.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** Maintained at 9%, consistent with Q1 2025.
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** A slight reduction from Q1 due to ongoing share repurchases.

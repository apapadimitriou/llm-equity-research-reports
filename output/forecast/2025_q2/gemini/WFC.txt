I have gathered the necessary Q1 2025 actuals and full-year 2025 guidance, as well as some 2024 full-year figures from sources available before July 1, 2025.

**Q1 2025 Actuals (from April 11, 2025 earnings release/call):**
*   **Revenue**: $20,149 million
*   **Noninterest expense**: $13,891 million
*   **Provision for credit losses**: $932 million
*   **Net Income**: $4,894 million
*   **Diluted EPS**: $1.39
*   **Diluted average common shares outstanding**: 3,321.6 million (for Q1 2025)

**Full-Year 2025 Guidance (from April 11, 2025 earnings call):**
*   **Net Interest Income (NII)**: expected to be ~1% to 3% higher than in 2024, with more growth anticipated in the second half of the year.
*   **Noninterest expense**: approximately $54.2 billion

**2024 Full-Year Actuals (from 2024 Annual Report, filed Feb 25, 2025):**
*   **Net Income**: $19.7 billion
*   **Diluted EPS**: $5.37
*   **Noninterest expense**: $54.6 billion
*   **Average common shares outstanding (for 2024)**: The 2024 Annual Report mentions "7% fewer diluted common shares" compared to a previous period and "average common shares outstanding have decreased by 21% since fourth quarter 2019". The 2024 10-K states "At February 14, 2025, 3,288,186,582 shares of common stock were outstanding." This is period-end, not average. For EPS calculation, average is needed. Let's use the Q1 2025 average of 3,321.6 million as a reasonable proxy for Q2, assuming share repurchases continue but don't drastically alter the average within a quarter.

**Missing/To Derive:**
*   **2024 Full-Year Revenue**: The 2024 Annual Report states "In total, revenue was relatively stable from the previous year as fee-based revenue growth largely offset an expected decline in net interest income." It doesn't give a specific number. I need to find 2024 total revenue.
*   **2024 Full-Year Net Interest Income (NII)**: Needed for 2025 NII projection. mentions "The bank reaffirmed its 2025 net interest income guidance expecting an increase of ~1%-3% Y/Y, implying a total of $47.7B-$47.8B." This implies 2024 NII was around $47.7B to $47.8B / 1.01 to 1.03. Let's use $47.7 billion as the base for 2024 NII, as implied by the 2025 guidance. also states "Net interest income of $12.2B, lagging the $12.3B Visible Alpha estimate, dropped from $12.8B in the prior quarter and $13.3B a year ago." This is Q1 2024 NII.
*   **2024 Full-Year Provision for Credit Losses**: Not explicitly stated in the 2024 Annual Report summary.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)**: Not explicitly stated for either Q1 2025 or full-year 2024. This will make EBITDA estimation difficult.

Let's try to find 2024 full-year revenue and provision for credit losses, and a proxy for D&A if possible. If not, I will have to make reasonable assumptions.

**Revised Plan:**

1.  **Gather 2024 Full Year Actuals:**
    *   Revenue: Need to find.
    *   Net Interest Income (NII): Use $47.7 billion as implied by 2025 guidance.
    *   Noninterest Expense: $54.6 billion
    *   Provision for Credit Losses: Need to find.
    *   Net Income: $19.7 billion
    *   Diluted Average Common Shares Outstanding: Need to find 2024 average. If not found, will use Q1 2025 average as a proxy.

2.  **Calculate Q1 2025 Operating Income:**
    *   Revenue: $20,149 million
    *   Noninterest expense: $13,891 million
    *   Provision for credit losses: $932 million
    *   Operating Income = Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses (This is a simplified banking operating income, as interest income/expense are already netted in NII which is part of revenue).

3.  **Project Q2 2025 Revenue:**
    *   **2025 Full-Year NII**: Low end of 1-3% higher than 2024 NII ($47.7B). Let's use 1% increase: $47.7B * 1.01 = $48.177 billion.
    *   **Q1 2025 NII**: From and, Q1 2025 NII was $11.5 billion.
    *   **Remaining NII for Q2-Q4**: $48.177B - $11.5B = $36.677 billion.
    *   Assume NII is distributed somewhat evenly across remaining quarters, or slightly higher in H2 as guided. Let's assume Q2 NII is similar to Q1, or slightly higher due to "more growth anticipated in the second half of the year". Let's project Q2 NII at $12.0 billion.
    *   **Q1 2025 Non-Interest Income**: Q1 2025 Total Revenue ($20.149B) - Q1 2025 NII ($11.5B) = $8.649 billion.
    *   Assume Non-Interest Income for Q2 is stable or slightly increases from Q1. Let's project Q2 Non-Interest Income at $8.7 billion.
    *   **Projected Q2 2025 Revenue**: Projected Q2 NII + Projected Q2 Non-Interest Income = $12.0B + $8.7B = $20.7 billion.

4.  **Project Q2 2025 Noninterest Expense:**
    *   **Full-year 2025 Noninterest Expense guidance**: $54.2 billion
    *   **Q1 2025 Noninterest Expense**: $13,891 million
    *   **Remaining Noninterest Expense for Q2-Q4**: $54.2B - $13.891B = $40.309 billion.
    *   Assume remaining expenses are spread somewhat evenly. $40.309B / 3 quarters = $13.436 billion per quarter. Let's use $13.4 billion for Q2.

5.  **Project Q2 2025 Provision for Credit Losses:**
    *   Q1 2025 Provision for Credit Losses: $932 million
    *   Assume similar level for Q2: $930 million.

6.  **Project Q2 2025 Operating Income:**
    *   Projected Q2 Revenue: $20,700 million
    *   Projected Q2 Noninterest Expense: $13,400 million
    *   Projected Q2 Provision for Credit Losses: $930 million
    *   Operating Income = Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses = $20,700M - $13,400M - $930M = $6,370 million.

7.  **Project Q2 2025 Net Income:**
    *   Need an estimated tax rate. From Q1 2025, Net Income was $4.894B. Pre-tax income (Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses) for Q1 was $20,149M - $13,891M - $932M = $5,326M.
    *   Effective tax rate for Q1 = ($5,326M - $4,894M) / $5,326M = 8.11%. This is unusually low, likely due to the "discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period matters" of $313 million mentioned in Q1 results.
    *   Let's look at 2024 full-year tax rate. 2024 Net Income $19.7B. 2024 Noninterest Expense $54.6B. Need 2024 Revenue and Provision for Credit Losses to estimate 2024 pre-tax income.
    *   If I cannot find a more normalized tax rate, I will have to make a reasonable assumption (e.g., 20-25%). Given the Q1 tax benefits, a higher normalized rate is appropriate for Q2. Let's assume a normalized tax rate of 22%.
    *   Projected Q2 Pre-tax Income: $6,370 million
    *   Projected Q2 Net Income = $6,370M * (1 - 0.22) = $4,968.6 million. Let's round to $4,969 million.

8.  **Project Q2 2025 EPS:**
    *   **Diluted Average Common Shares Outstanding**: Q1 2025 was 3,321.6 million. Assume this remains relatively stable for Q2.
    *   Projected Q2 EPS = $4,969 million / 3,321.6 million = $1.4959. Let's round to $1.50.

9.  **Project Q2 2025 EBITDA:**
    *   As discussed, EBITDA is not a standard metric for banks. Without D&A, a direct calculation is not possible.
    *   For a bank, a common proxy for "operating earnings" before certain non-cash items and taxes might be Net Income + Taxes + Provision for Credit Losses. However, this still doesn't isolate D&A.
    *   Given the prompt requires an EBITDA figure, and without specific D&A, I will have to make a simplifying assumption. For financial institutions, D&A is often a smaller component of non-interest expense compared to other operating costs.
    *   Let's assume D&A is a small percentage of non-interest expense. If I cannot find any guidance or historical data for WFC's D&A, I will have to make a general assumption.
    *   Let's assume D&A is approximately 5% of Noninterest Expense.
    *   Projected Q2 Noninterest Expense: $13,400 million
    *   Estimated Q2 D&A = $13,400M * 0.05 = $670 million.
    *   EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + D&A (simplified for a bank, where interest is core revenue/expense).
    *   Taxes for Q2 = $6,370M - $4,969M = $1,401 million.
    *   Projected Q2 EBITDA = $4,969M (Net Income) + $1,401M (Taxes) + $670M (D&A) = $7,040 million.
    *   Alternatively, if we consider Operating Income as a starting point, and add back D&A.
    *   Operating Income (as calculated above) = Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses. This is already after "operating expenses" which would include D&A.
    *   So, if Operating Income is $6,370 million, and Noninterest Expense includes D&A, then to get to EBITDA, we would need to add back D&A to Operating Income.
    *   Let's use the definition of Operating Income as "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes" for a non-financial company. For a bank, "Operating Income" is often presented before taxes and after provisions.
    *   Let's stick to the definition of Operating Income as Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses.
    *   To get to EBITDA, we need to add back D&A to this Operating Income.
    *   Projected Q2 EBITDA = Projected Q2 Operating Income + Estimated Q2 D&A = $6,370M + $670M = $7,040 million.

10. **Project Q2 2025 Free Cash Flow:**
    *   For a bank, Free Cash Flow is not typically reported or easily derived in the same way as for industrial companies. It usually involves Net Income + D&A - Capital Expenditures +/- Changes in Working Capital (excluding core banking assets/liabilities).
    *   Without specific guidance on capital expenditures or detailed cash flow projections for Q2 2025, it's very difficult to forecast FCF for a bank.
    *   I will make a simplifying assumption based on historical trends if available, or a conservative estimate.
    *   Let's look for any mention of capital expenditures or cash flow from investing activities in the 2024 10-K or Q1 2025 10-Q. The search results do not provide this level of detail for forecasting FCF.
    *   Given the lack of specific data for FCF for a bank, and the constraint to only use provided sources, I will have to make a very broad assumption. A common simplification for financial institutions, when detailed cash flow is unavailable, is to assume FCF is close to Net Income, or a portion of it, assuming capital expenditures are covered by internal cash generation and changes in core banking working capital are not considered "free cash." This is a significant simplification.
    *   Let's assume Free Cash Flow for a bank is approximately Net Income adjusted for some non-cash items and minimal capital expenditures. Given the difficulty, I will use a conservative estimate relative to Net Income. Let's assume FCF is around 80% of Net Income, as a very rough proxy in the absence of specific data.
    *   Projected Q2 FCF = $4,969 million * 0.80 = $3,975.2 million. Let's round to $3,975 million.

Let's double check the 2024 NII figure. states "The bank reaffirmed its 2025 net interest income guidance expecting an increase of ~1%-3% Y/Y, implying a total of $47.7B-$47.8B." This means the *2025* NII is expected to be $47.7B-$47.8B. So, 2024 NII would be $47.7B / 1.01 (low end of 1% increase) = $47.227 billion. Or $47.7B / 1.03 (high end of 3% increase) = $46.31 billion. Let's use $47.2 billion as the 2024 NII for calculation.

Recalculate 2025 Full-Year NII:
*   2024 NII (estimated from 2025 guidance): $47.2 billion.
*   2025 Full-Year NII (low end of 1% increase): $47.2B * 1.01 = $47.672 billion. Let's use $47.7 billion for consistency with the guidance.

Recalculate Q2 NII:
*   2025 Full-Year NII: $47.7 billion
*   Q1 2025 NII: $11.5 billion
*   Remaining NII for Q2-Q4: $47.7B - $11.5B = $36.2 billion.
*   Assuming remaining NII is spread somewhat evenly, $36.2B / 3 quarters = $12.067 billion. This aligns with my previous estimate of $12.0 billion, or slightly higher for Q2. Let's use $12,067 million for Q2 NII.

Recalculate Q2 Revenue:
*   Projected Q2 NII: $12,067 million
*   Projected Q2 Non-Interest Income: $8,700 million (keeping this consistent with previous assumption, as no new info to change it)
*   Projected Q2 Revenue = $12,067M + $8,700M = $20,767 million.

Recalculate Q2 Operating Income:
*   Projected Q2 Revenue: $20,767 million
*   Projected Q2 Noninterest Expense: $13,400 million
*   Projected Q2 Provision for Credit Losses: $930 million
*   Operating Income = $20,767M - $13,400M - $930M = $6,437 million.

Recalculate Q2 Net Income:
*   Projected Q2 Pre-tax Income: $6,437 million
*   Estimated Q2 Net Income = $6,437M * (1 - 0.22) = $5,020.86 million. Let's round to $5,021 million.

Recalculate Q2 EPS:
*   Projected Q2 EPS = $5,021 million / 3,321.6 million = $1.5116. Let's round to $1.51.

Recalculate Q2 EBITDA:
*   Estimated Q2 D&A = $670 million (5% of Noninterest Expense)
*   Projected Q2 EBITDA = $6,437M (Operating Income) + $670M (D&A) = $7,107 million.

Recalculate Q2 Free Cash Flow:
*   Projected Q2 FCF = $5,021 million * 0.80 = $4,016.8 million. Let's round to $4,017 million.

Final check on diluted average common shares outstanding for 2024. The 2024 Annual Report mentions "7% fewer diluted common shares" and "average common shares outstanding have decreased by 21% since fourth quarter 2019". This is not a direct number. However, the Q1 2025 diluted average common shares outstanding is 3,321.6 million. Given the share repurchases in Q1 2025 ($3.5 billion), it's reasonable to assume the average for Q2 would be similar or slightly lower, but for a forecast on July 1, 2025, using the most recent available average (Q1 2025) is appropriate.

One last check for 2024 full-year revenue and provision for credit losses.
From "Our results were solid in 2024 as Wells Fargo generated $19.7 billion in net income, $5.37 per diluted share, and 13.4% return on tangible common equity." And "In total, revenue was relatively stable from the previous year as fee-based revenue growth largely offset an expected decline in net interest income."
From (Q1 2024 earnings report, available before July 1, 2025) "Total revenue of $20.9B, beating the $20.2B consensus, increased from $20.5B in the previous quarter and $20.7B a year ago." This is Q1 2024 revenue.
From (Q3 2024 earnings report, available before July 1, 2025) "Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) has released its third quarter 2024 financial results." This would contain Q3 2024 data.

The prompt asks for a forecast for 2025_Q2. I have used Q1 2025 actuals and full-year 2025 guidance to derive the Q2 2025 forecast. The 2024 full-year numbers are primarily used as a base for 2025 guidance.

Let's finalize the numbers based on the derived calculations.Here are the financial forecasts for Wells Fargo (WFC) for 2025_Q2, based on publicly available information on or before July 1, 2025.

**Key Information and Assumptions Used for Forecast:**

*   **Q1 2025 Actuals (reported April 11, 2025):**
    *   Revenue: $20,149 million
    *   Noninterest expense: $13,891 million
    *   Provision for credit losses: $932 million
    *   Net Income: $4,894 million
    *   Diluted EPS: $1.39
    *   Diluted average common shares outstanding: 3,321.6 million
    *   Q1 2025 Net Interest Income (NII): $11.5 billion
    *   Q1 2025 Non-Interest Income: $20,149 million (Total Revenue) - $11,500 million (NII) = $8,649 million.

*   **Full-Year 2025 Guidance (from April 11, 2025 earnings call):**
    *   Net Interest Income (NII): expected to be ~1% to 3% higher than in 2024, with more growth anticipated in the second half of the year.
    *   Noninterest expense: approximately $54.2 billion

*   **2024 Full-Year NII (derived from 2025 guidance):**
    *   The 2025 NII guidance implies a total of $47.7 billion to $47.8 billion for 2025. Taking the low end of the 1% increase from 2024, 2024 NII is estimated as $47.7 billion / 1.01 = $47.227 billion. We will use $47.2 billion as the estimated 2024 NII.

*   **Assumptions for Q2 2025:**
    *   **Net Interest Income (NII):**
        *   2025 Full-Year NII (low end of 1% increase from $47.2B): $47.2 billion * 1.01 = $47.672 billion. Rounded to $47.7 billion for consistency with guidance.
        *   Remaining NII for Q2-Q4: $47.7 billion (FY 2025) - $11.5 billion (Q1 2025) = $36.2 billion.
        *   Assuming a relatively even distribution for the remaining three quarters, Q2 NII = $36.2 billion / 3 = $12.067 billion.
    *   **Non-Interest Income:** Assumed to be stable or slightly increase from Q1. Projecting $8,700 million for Q2.
    *   **Total Revenue:** Sum of projected NII and Non-Interest Income.
    *   **Noninterest Expense:**
        *   Full-year 2025 Noninterest Expense guidance: $54.2 billion.
        *   Remaining Noninterest Expense for Q2-Q4: $54.2 billion - $13.891 billion (Q1 2025) = $40.309 billion.
        *   Assuming an even distribution for the remaining three quarters, Q2 Noninterest Expense = $40.309 billion / 3 = $13.436 billion. Rounded to $13,400 million.
    *   **Provision for Credit Losses:** Assumed to be similar to Q1 2025. Projecting $930 million.
    *   **Tax Rate:** Q1 2025 had discrete tax benefits. A normalized tax rate of 22% is assumed for Q2.
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** Not explicitly provided for banks in the same way as industrial companies. Assumed to be approximately 5% of Noninterest Expense for EBITDA calculation.
    *   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** For a financial institution, FCF is not a standard reported metric. As a proxy, it is estimated as 80% of Net Income, given the absence of detailed cash flow projections.
    *   **Diluted Average Common Shares Outstanding:** Assumed to be stable at Q1 2025 levels of 3,321.6 million.

**Calculations for 2025_Q2:**

*   **Revenue:**
    *   Projected Q2 NII: $12,067,000,000
    *   Projected Q2 Non-Interest Income: $8,700,000,000
    *   Total Revenue = $12,067,000,000 + $8,700,000,000 = $20,767,000,000

*   **Operating Income:**
    *   Operating Income = Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses
    *   Operating Income = $20,767,000,000 - $13,400,000,000 - $930,000,000 = $6,437,000,000

*   **Net Income:**
    *   Pre-tax Income = Operating Income (as calculated above, which is before taxes) = $6,437,000,000
    *   Estimated Taxes = $6,437,000,000 * 0.22 = $1,416,140,000
    *   Net Income = $6,437,000,000 - $1,416,140,000 = $5,020,860,000. Rounded to $5,021,000,000.

*   **EBITDA:**
    *   Estimated D&A = $13,400,000,000 (Noninterest Expense) * 0.05 = $670,000,000
    *   EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A = $6,437,000,000 + $670,000,000 = $7,107,000,000

*   **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Free Cash Flow = Net Income * 0.80 (proxy)
    *   Free Cash Flow = $5,021,000,000 * 0.80 = $4,016,800,000. Rounded to $4,017,000,000.

*   **EPS:**
    *   EPS = Net Income / Diluted Average Common Shares Outstanding
    *   EPS = $5,021,000,000 / 3,321,600,000 = $1.5116. Rounded to $1.51.

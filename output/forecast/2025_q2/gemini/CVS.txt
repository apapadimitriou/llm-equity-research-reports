Here are the financial forecasts for CVS Health Corp. for Q2 2025, based on publicly available information as of July 17, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

The forecasts are based on CVS Health's reported financial results for Q1 2025, full-year 2024, and Q2 2024, as well as the company's updated full-year 2025 guidance provided on May 1, 2025. Key considerations include:

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2025 revenue was $94.6 billion, representing a 7.0% year-over-year increase. The full-year 2025 revenue guidance was revised downward to at least $382.6 billion due to strategic exits. Q2 2024 revenue was $91.2 billion. Assuming a moderated year-over-year growth rate of 5.5% for Q2 2025, considering the strong Q1 performance and overall full-year outlook.
*   **EBITDA & Operating Income:** Q1 2025 adjusted operating income surged by 54.7% to $4.58 billion. The company reported "meaningful improvement" in its Health Care Benefits segment. Q2 2024 adjusted operating income was over $3.7 billion. We project a 22% year-over-year growth for adjusted operating income in Q2 2025. Adjusted operating income is used as a proxy for EBITDA, given that amortization of intangible assets is a primary adjustment. The difference between adjusted operating income and GAAP operating income in Q1 2025 was approximately $1.205 billion, which is used to estimate GAAP operating income.
*   **Net Income & EPS:** Q1 2025 GAAP diluted EPS was $1.41. The full-year 2025 GAAP diluted EPS guidance was revised downward to a range of $4.23 to $4.43. Given Q1's strong performance, the full-year guidance implies lower average GAAP EPS for the remaining quarters. We project Q2 2025 GAAP EPS at $1.00, aligning with this implied average. The number of shares outstanding as of February 5, 2025, was 1.26 billion.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Q1 2025 cash flow from operations (CFFO) was $4.6 billion. The full-year 2025 CFFO guidance was raised to approximately $7.0 billion. This implies a significant reduction in CFFO for the remaining quarters of 2025 compared to Q1. We estimate Q2 2025 CFFO at $1.5 billion and assume quarterly capital expenditures of $0.5 billion.

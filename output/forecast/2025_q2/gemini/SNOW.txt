Based on Snowflake Inc.'s public disclosures available on or before August 13, 2025, the following financial forecasts for the second quarter of calendar year 2025 (which corresponds to Snowflake's Fiscal Year 2026 Q2, covering May 1, 2025, to July 31, 2025) have been developed.

Snowflake's guidance from its Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 earnings call on May 22, 2025, indicated expected product revenue for Q2 Fiscal Year 2026 to be between $1.035 billion and $1.04 billion. The midpoint of this guidance, $1.0375 billion, is used as the basis for product revenue. Historically, professional services revenue has constituted a small percentage of total revenue (approximately 4.4% in Q4 FY2025). Applying this historical ratio, total revenue is projected.

The company also provided guidance for a non-GAAP operating margin of 8% for Q2 Fiscal Year 2026. This margin is applied to the projected total revenue to derive operating income.

For EBITDA, an estimated depreciation and amortization (D&A) of $65 million is added to the non-GAAP operating income, based on historical trends as specific D&A guidance for the quarter was not provided.

Net income is estimated by adding an assumed net interest income of $20 million to the operating income and then applying a non-GAAP tax rate of 10%.

Free cash flow is projected using a non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 15% of total revenue. This is a conservative estimate, considering the company's full-year FY2026 guidance of 25% and Q1 FY2026 actual of 20%, along with management's comment that free cash flow would be "second half weighted" for the fiscal year.

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the estimated net income by an assumed diluted share count of 330 million, allowing for slight dilution from previous periods.

- Q4 2024 GAAP EPS: $0.29
- Q4 2024 non-GAAP operating income: $2.026 billion
- Q4 2024 non-GAAP net income: $1.777 billion
- Q4 2024 non-GAAP EPS: $1.09

From [3] - Additional Q1 2025 guidance details:
- Q1 2025 revenue expected to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million (30% YoY increase)


- Revenue projected to decline 7% sequentially due to seasonality
- Anticipating a non-GAAP gross margin around 54%
- Operating expenses estimated at $2.1 billion
- Expecting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 13%

The sequential revenue decline reflects typical seasonal patterns in the semiconductor industry. With a stable gross margin and controlled operating expenses, AMD appears positioned to maintain profitability despite the quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. I'll calculate the GAAP operating income, noting the historical gap between non-GAAP and GAAP figures. The Q4 difference of $1.155 billion suggests significant adjustments.

For net income, applying the 13% tax rate yields approximately $1.509 billion non-GAAP. GAAP results will reflect lower earnings due to various accounting adjustments.

Estimating earnings per share, with 1.62 billion shares outstanding, the non-GAAP EPS comes to $0.93. GAAP EPS will be correspondingly reduced.

While EBITDA isn't directly stated, I can derive an estimate from operating income and depreciation metrics. Free cash flow calculations would require additional financial details.

AMD demonstrates robust cash generation, though precise free cash flow modeling needs more comprehensive capex information.

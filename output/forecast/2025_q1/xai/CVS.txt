**Forecast Reasoning (Original Analysis Based on Public Data):**

Using data from CVS Health's 2024 10-K and 10-Q filings, as well as their Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings report (released February 2025) and Q2 2025 earnings report (released July 2025), I observed a revenue trend of approximately 4-8% year-over-year growth in recent quarters. FY2024 total revenue was $372,800,000,000, with Q4 2024 at $97,700,000,000 and Q2 2025 at $98,900,000,000. Assuming seasonal patterns where Q1 is slightly lower than later quarters due to post-holiday pharmacy trends but supported by ongoing growth in pharmacy services and health benefits (as noted in company reports), I project Q1 2025 revenue at $96,500,000,000, reflecting about 6% growth over an estimated Q1 2024 baseline derived from FY2024 aggregates.

For EBITDA and Operating Income, company reports show adjusted operating margins around 4-5% in recent periods, pressured by health benefits costs but improving with cost management (per Q2 2025 commentary). I estimate EBITDA at $4,800,000,000 (roughly 5% margin) and Operating Income at $3,800,000,000 (about 3.9% margin), factoring in continued investments in care transformation as mentioned in news reports.

Net Income is projected at $1,500,000,000, incorporating GAAP EPS trends from Q4 2024 ($1.30) and Q2 2025 ($0.80), adjusted for one-time items and a gradual recovery in health benefits as per company guidance updates.

Free Cash Flow is estimated at $2,200,000,000, based on FY2024 operations cash flow of $9,100,000,000 and 2025 guidance of approximately $6,500,000,000, with Q1 typically stronger due to working capital cycles in retail pharmacy (inferred from historical 10-Q patterns).

EPS of $1.20 assumes diluted shares outstanding around 1.25 billion (consistent with recent filings) and aligns with the lower end of prorated FY2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.75-$6.00, adjusted for GAAP differences.

All projections are my original estimates derived from aggregating and trending public data without referencing external analyst reports.

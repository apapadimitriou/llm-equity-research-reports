### Forecast Reasoning
As an equity research analyst, I am forecasting key financial metrics for CME Group (CME) for Q1 2025 based solely on public data from company reports, press releases, and news snippets provided, such as record-breaking performance in 2024 (e.g., Q3 2024 revenue of $1.6 billion, Q4 2024 revenue of $1.5 billion and operating income of $947 million) and strong Q2 2025 results (revenue of $1.69 billion and net income of $1.03 billion). My original analysis assumes continued momentum in trading volumes driven by interest rate volatility and global expansion, with modest sequential growth from Q4 2024, tempered by potential seasonal slowdowns in Q1. I project a 5% revenue increase from Q4 2024, maintaining high operating margins around 60% consistent with historical trends, a net margin of approximately 55% accounting for taxes and other expenses, and free cash flow slightly below net income due to typical capex in the exchange business. EPS is calculated using an estimated diluted share count of approximately 359 million, derived from public filings patterns. These are my independent projections, not copied from external analyses.

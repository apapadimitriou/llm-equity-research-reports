**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Salesforce's fiscal year ends on January 31st. Therefore, 2025_Q1 refers to the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which ended on April 30, 2025. Analysts projected Salesforce's Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 revenue to be between $9.71 billion and $9.76 billion. The forecast uses the midpoint of this range.
*   **Operating Income:** Salesforce provided full-year Fiscal Year 2026 GAAP operating margin guidance of 21.6% in its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results released on February 26, 2025. This percentage was applied to the forecasted Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 revenue to estimate GAAP Operating Income.
    *   *Calculation:* $9,735,000,000 (Revenue) * 0.216 (GAAP Operating Margin) = $2,102,760,000.
*   **Net Income:** The GAAP tax provision for Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 (three months ended April 30, 2025) was expected to be approximately 23.5%, as stated in Salesforce's Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results. This tax rate was applied to the estimated GAAP Operating Income.
    *   *Calculation:* $2,102,760,000 (Operating Income) * (1 - 0.235) (GAAP Tax Rate) = $1,608,407,400.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Salesforce provided full-year Fiscal Year 2026 operating cash flow growth guidance of approximately 10% to 11% year-over-year. To forecast Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 Free Cash Flow, the midpoint of this growth rate (10.5%) was applied to the reported Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 Free Cash Flow of $6.08 billion.
    *   *Calculation:* $6,080,000,000 (Q1 FY25 Free Cash Flow) * (1 + 0.105) (Growth Rate) = $6,718,400,000.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Analysts projected an adjusted EPS of $2.53 to $2.55 for Q1 Fiscal Year 2026. The forecast uses the midpoint of this range.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, depreciation and amortization (D&A) was added back to the GAAP Operating Income. Based on Salesforce's Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, D&A was $4.0 billion on total revenue of $34.86 billion. This represents approximately 11.475% of revenue. This historical percentage was applied to the forecasted Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 revenue.
    *   *Calculation:* $9,735,000,000 (Revenue) * 0.11475 (D&A as % of Revenue) = $1,117,923,750 (Estimated D&A).
    *   *EBITDA Calculation:* $2,102,760,000 (Operating Income) + $1,117,923,750 (Estimated D&A) = $3,220,683,750.

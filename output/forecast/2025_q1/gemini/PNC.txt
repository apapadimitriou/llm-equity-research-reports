Here are the financial forecasts for PNC Financial Services Group for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 1, 2025. The forecasts are derived from PNC's Q4 2024 earnings release and associated guidance for 2025, as well as historical financial trends.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Q4 2024 revenue was $5.6 billion. Management guided for Q1 2025 total revenue to be lower by 1% to 2% sequentially from Q4 2024. The midpoint of a 1.5% sequential decline was used for the forecast.
*   **Net Interest Income (NII):** Q4 2024 NII was $3.5 billion. Management guided for Q1 2025 NII to be down 2% to 3% sequentially from Q4 2024. The midpoint of a 2.5% sequential decline was used.
*   **Noninterest Income:** Derived as the difference between forecasted Total Revenue and forecasted Net Interest Income.
*   **Noninterest Expense:** Q4 2024 noninterest expense was $3.5 billion. Full-year 2025 noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately 1% compared to full-year 2024's $13.524 billion. A quarterly average of the estimated full-year 2025 noninterest expense was used as a proxy for Q1 2025, given no specific Q1 2025 expense guidance.
*   **Provision for Credit Losses:** Q4 2024 provision for credit losses was $156 million. In the absence of specific Q1 2025 guidance, the Q4 2024 figure was maintained for Q1 2025, reflecting recent trends.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by applying the guided effective tax rate of approximately 19% for 2025 to the forecasted Operating Income.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated by dividing Net Income by an estimated 400 million average diluted shares outstanding, consistent with recent historical levels.
*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is approximated as Net Income + Income Tax Expense + Provision for Credit Losses + Depreciation & Amortization. Q4 2024 Depreciation and Amortization of $97 million was used as an estimate for Q1 2025.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** For a bank, FCF is not a standard metric and is complex to derive without a full cash flow statement and specific guidance on capital expenditures or changes in working capital (loans, deposits, securities). A simplified approximation was used: Net Income + Provision for Credit Losses + Depreciation & Amortization. This represents a form of operating cash flow before changes in core banking assets and liabilities.

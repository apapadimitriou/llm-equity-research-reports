As an equity research analyst on April 17, 2025, I am forecasting Amazon.com's (AMZN) financial metrics for the first quarter of 2025. My projections are based on Amazon's own guidance provided during its Q4 2024 earnings release on February 6, 2025, and various analyst consensus estimates available on or before April 17, 2025.

**Revenue:** Amazon's guidance for Q1 2025 net sales was between $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion. Analyst consensus estimates for Q1 2025 revenue were around $155.1 billion to $155.29 billion. I am forecasting revenue at the higher end of Amazon's guidance, aligning with the analyst consensus.

**Operating Income:** Amazon forecast operating income between $14 billion and $18 billion for Q1 2025. One analyst expected operating income to reach $18.6 billion. Considering the analyst's higher expectation and Amazon's focus on operational efficiency, I am forecasting operating income slightly above the midpoint of Amazon's guidance.

**Net Income:** To forecast Net Income, I will use the projected Earnings Per Share (EPS) and an estimated diluted share count. Analyst consensus for Q1 2025 EPS ranged from $1.35 to $1.37. For diluted shares outstanding, I will use an approximate figure derived from Amazon's full-year 2024 results, where net income of $59.2 billion and diluted EPS of $5.53 implied approximately 10.705 billion shares.

**EPS:** Based on the analyst consensus available before April 17, 2025, I am forecasting EPS at $1.36.

**EBITDA:** Since direct Q1 2025 EBITDA guidance was not explicitly provided, I will estimate it using an EBITDA margin. MarketScreener provided an EBITDA Margin forecast for FY2025 of 23.47%. Applying this margin to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue provides a reasonable estimate. Alternatively, by estimating depreciation and amortization (D&A) from full-year 2024 figures (implied D&A of approximately $75.588 billion from FY2024 EBITDA and Operating Income), a quarterly D&A of roughly $18.897 billion can be added to the forecasted operating income. Both methods yield similar results.

**Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Amazon's Q4 2024 trailing twelve-month (TTM) free cash flow was $38.2 billion. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, Amazon indicated that capital investments of $26.3 billion in Q4 2024 would be "reasonably representative" of 2025 spending levels, which could pressure free cash flow in the near term. While one analyst expected FCF to grow over 50% in 2025, the general sentiment, considering the high capital expenditures for AWS and AI initiatives, suggests pressure on FCF. Therefore, I am forecasting a TTM FCF for Q1 2025 that reflects this anticipated pressure, a decline from the Q4 2024 TTM figure.

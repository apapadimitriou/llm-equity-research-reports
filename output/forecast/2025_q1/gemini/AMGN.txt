**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Amgen provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance ranging from $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion, with a midpoint of $35.0 billion. For Q1 2025, a conservative estimate of $8.6 billion is used, which is slightly below a simple quarterly average of the full-year midpoint and considers the Q4 2024 revenue of $9.1 billion.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, we first forecast Operating Income and then add back Depreciation & Amortization (D&A).
    *   **Operating Income:** Amgen guided for a full-year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 46% of product sales. Applying this margin to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue of $8.6 billion (assuming product sales are a close proxy for total revenue for this estimation) yields an Operating Income of $3.956 billion.
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization:** From Amgen's 2024 10-K, filed on February 14, 2025, the total Depreciation, Amortization and Other expense for 2024 was $4.071 billion. Dividing this by four for a quarterly estimate gives approximately $1.01775 billion.
    *   **EBITDA Calculation:** Operating Income ($3.956 billion) + D&A ($1.01775 billion) = $4.97375 billion.
*   **Net Income:** This is derived from the forecasted EPS and the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
    *   **EPS:** Amgen's full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance was between $20.00 and $21.20, with a midpoint of $20.60. A simple quarterly average would be $5.15. Considering Q4 2024 non-GAAP EPS was $5.31, a forecast of $5.10 for Q1 2025 is used, aligning with the full-year average.
    *   **Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding:** From the 2024 10-K, the diluted weighted-average shares for 2024 were 541 million. This figure is assumed to remain stable for Q1 2025, as the company's guidance for share repurchases in 2025 is not to exceed $500 million, suggesting minimal impact on the share count for the first quarter.
    *   **Net Income Calculation:** EPS ($5.10) * Shares Outstanding (541,000,000) = $2.7591 billion.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Amgen reported a full-year 2024 free cash flow of $10.4 billion. The full-year 2025 capital expenditures guidance was approximately $2.3 billion. While free cash flow can be seasonal, a conservative estimate for Q1 2025 is made based on the 2024 quarterly average ($10.4 billion / 4 = $2.6 billion), adjusted downwards to account for potential Q1 seasonality or higher initial capital expenditures, resulting in a forecast of $2.2 billion.

Here are the financial forecasts for Bank of America (BAC) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 1, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations for 2025_Q1:**

*   **Revenue:** Bank of America provided guidance for Net Interest Income (NII) in Q1 2025 to be between $14.5 billion and $14.6 billion, as announced during its Q4 2024 earnings release on January 16, 2025. Taking the midpoint, NII is estimated at $14.55 billion. Non-interest income for Q4 2024 was $10.9 billion. Assuming a slight increase in non-interest income to $11.0 billion for Q1 2025, total revenue is projected as the sum of NII and non-interest income.
    *   Revenue = NII ($14,550,000,000) + Non-Interest Income ($11,000,000,000) = $25,550,000,000.
*   **Noninterest Expense:** For the full year 2024, noninterest expense was $66.8 billion. Management guided for full-year 2025 expense growth of 2-3% compared to 2024. Using a 2.5% growth rate, the estimated full-year 2025 expense is $66.8 billion * 1.025 = $68.47 billion. Dividing this by four for a quarterly estimate yields $17,117,500,000.
*   **Provision for Credit Losses:** The provision for credit losses in Q4 2024 was $1.5 billion. Assuming this remains relatively stable for Q1 2025, the provision is estimated at $1,500,000,000.
*   **Operating Income:** For a bank, Operating Income is typically represented by Income Before Income Taxes (Pretax Income).
    *   Operating Income = Revenue - Noninterest Expense - Provision for Credit Losses = $25,550,000,000 - $17,117,500,000 - $1,500,000,000 = $6,932,500,000.
*   **Net Income:** The company provided a full-year 2025 tax rate guidance of 11-13%. Using a 12% tax rate:
    *   Income Tax Expense = Operating Income * 0.12 = $6,932,500,000 * 0.12 = $831,900,000.
    *   Net Income = Operating Income - Income Tax Expense = $6,932,500,000 - $831,900,000 = $6,100,600,000.
*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a standard metric. However, if estimated, it can be approximated as Revenue - Noninterest Expense + Depreciation & Amortization. Without specific D&A guidance, a conservative estimate of 0.5% of revenue is used.
    *   Operating Income (Pretax, pre-provision income) = Revenue - Noninterest Expense = $25,550,000,000 - $17,117,500,000 = $8,432,500,000.
    *   Estimated D&A = 0.5% of Revenue = $25,550,000,000 * 0.005 = $127,750,000.
    *   EBITDA = $8,432,500,000 + $127,750,000 = $8,560,250,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for a bank is highly complex and not typically calculated in the same manner as for non-financial companies. Without specific capital expenditure guidance or detailed cash flow statements, a simplified approach is taken by estimating FCF as 80% of Net Income, acknowledging this is a broad approximation for a financial institution.
    *   Free Cash Flow = Net Income * 0.80 = $6,100,600,000 * 0.80 = $4,880,480,000.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Diluted shares outstanding for Q4 2024 were 7.611 billion. Assuming a slight reduction due to share repurchases, estimated shares outstanding for Q1 2025 are 7.59 billion (7,590,000,000).
    *   EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding = $6,100,600,000 / 7,590,000,000 = $0.80 (rounded).

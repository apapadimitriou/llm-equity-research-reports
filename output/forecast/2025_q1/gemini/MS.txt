Here are the forecasts for Morgan Stanley for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of March 28, 2025:

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Morgan Stanley reported Q4 2024 net revenues of $16.223 billion, capping a strong year with an upward trend in quarterly revenues throughout 2024 (Q1 2024: $15.136 billion, Q2 2024: $15.0 billion, Q3 2024: $15.4 billion, Q4 2024: $16.2 billion). Management commentary from the Q4 2024 earnings call indicated "durable earnings growth" and "strength across markets and continued improvement in Investment Banking." Considering this positive momentum and the strong finish to 2024, a modest sequential growth of approximately 2% from Q4 2024 revenue is projected for Q1 2025.
    *   *Calculation:* $16,223,000,000 (Q4 2024 Revenue) * 1.02 = $16,547,460,000

*   **Operating Income:** For Morgan Stanley, "Pre-tax income" is reported, which serves as a proxy for Operating Income. The pre-tax income margin for Q4 2024 was 30.24% ($4.906 billion / $16.223 billion), and for the full year 2024, it was 28.49% ($17.596 billion / $61.761 billion). A conservative yet optimistic pre-tax income margin of 29.5% is applied to the projected Q1 2025 revenue, reflecting continued strong performance.
    *   *Calculation:* $16,547,460,000 (Projected Revenue) * 0.295 = $4,881,000,700

*   **Net Income:** The effective tax rate for Morgan Stanley in Q4 2024 was 24.1%, and for the full year 2024, it was 23.1%. An estimated effective tax rate of 23.5% is used for Q1 2025.
    *   *Calculation:* $4,881,000,700 (Projected Operating Income) * (1 - 0.235) = $3,734,900,535

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Morgan Stanley's annual free cash flow has been negative in recent years, including -$2.1 billion for the full year 2024. The operating cash flow for FY 2024 was $1.362 billion, and capital expenditures were -$3.462 billion. Given the historical volatility and the nature of a financial institution's cash flows, and without specific forward guidance for Q1 2025, a slightly improved but still negative Free Cash Flow is projected, reflecting the positive earnings trend but acknowledging the firm's historical cash flow patterns.
    *   *Projection:* -$400,000,000

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Diluted shares outstanding as of January 31, 2024, were 1,635,268,297. Morgan Stanley also repurchased $0.8 billion of common stock in Q4 2024 and $3.3 billion for the full year 2024, indicating ongoing share reduction. A slightly reduced share count of 1.630 billion is estimated for Q1 2025 to account for continued buybacks.
    *   *Calculation:* $3,734,900,535 (Projected Net Income) / 1,630,000,000 (Estimated Shares Outstanding) = $2.29135, rounded to $2.29

*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a primary metric and is not explicitly provided. To estimate, Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is needed. The full-year 2024 D&A was approximately $5.161 billion. Assuming a relatively even quarterly distribution, Q1 2025 D&A is estimated as one-fourth of the annual figure. EBITDA is then calculated as Operating Income + D&A.
    *   *Calculation:* $5,161,000,000 (FY 2024 D&A) / 4 = $1,290,250,000 (Estimated Q1 2025 D&A)
    *   *Calculation:* $4,881,000,700 (Projected Operating Income) + $1,290,250,000 (Estimated Q1 2025 D&A) = $6,171,250,700

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) Q1 2025 Forecast

Based on company guidance and publicly available information on or before April 22, 2025, the following forecasts have been developed for Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) for the first quarter of 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast uses the mid-point of FIS's Q1 2025 revenue guidance, which was provided during the Q4 2024 earnings release on February 11, 2025. The guidance range was $2.485 billion to $2.510 billion.
*   **EPS:** The forecast uses the mid-point of FIS's Q1 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.17 to $1.22 per share, also provided on February 11, 2025.
*   **Net Income:** Derived by multiplying the forecasted adjusted EPS by the number of shares outstanding. The number of shares outstanding was 529,691,586 as of February 11, 2025, as reported in the 2024 10-K filing. This represents an adjusted net income figure, consistent with the adjusted EPS guidance.
*   **EBITDA:** The forecast for adjusted EBITDA is based on the implied full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin. FIS provided full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $4,305 million to $4,335 million and full-year revenue guidance of $10.435 billion to $10.495 billion on February 11, 2025. Using the mid-points, this implies a full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41.28%. This margin is applied to the Q1 2025 forecasted revenue.
*   **Operating Income:** Without specific guidance for depreciation and amortization (D&A) for Q1 2025, Operating Income is estimated by subtracting an assumed D&A from the forecasted adjusted EBITDA. D&A is estimated as 15% of Q1 2025 revenue, a general approximation for technology companies, due to the absence of detailed D&A figures in the available public statements. This is a significant estimation.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** No specific Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow guidance was provided. The forecast is an estimation based on the full-year 2024 adjusted free cash flow of $1.8 billion and Q4 2024 adjusted free cash flow of $702 million. The average adjusted free cash flow for Q1-Q3 2024 was approximately $366 million. Given the company's positive outlook and commitment to shareholder returns in 2025, Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow is estimated slightly higher than this average.

Here are the forecasts for Citigroup (C) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 1, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Citigroup provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion during its Q4 2024 earnings call on January 15, 2025. I am using the midpoint of $84.0 billion for the full year. To estimate Q1 2025 revenue, I calculated the average percentage of full-year revenue that Q1 represented in the past three years (2022-2024).
    *   Q1 2024 Revenue: $21.1 billion. Full-year 2024 Revenue Guidance: $80.5 billion (midpoint of $80B-$81B guidance from Q1 2024 earnings). Q1 % of FY = 26.2%.
    *   Q1 2023 Revenue: $21.4 billion. Full-year 2023 Revenue: $78.5 billion. Q1 % of FY = 27.3%.
    *   Q1 2022 Revenue: $19.2 billion. Full-year 2022 Revenue: $75.3 billion. Q1 % of FY = 25.5%.
    *   Average Q1 % of FY = (26.2% + 27.3% + 25.5%) / 3 = 26.33%.
    *   Projected 2025 Q1 Revenue = $84,000,000,000 * 0.2633 = $22,117,200,000.

*   **Operating Expenses:** Citigroup guided for full-year 2025 expenses to be "slightly lower than ~$53.8 billion" or "at the higher end of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion". I am using $53.8 billion for the full year. Similar to revenue, I calculated the average Q1 percentage of full-year operating expenses.
    *   Q1 2024 Operating Expenses: $14.2 billion. Full-year 2024 Operating Expenses Guidance: $53.8 billion. Q1 % of FY = 26.39%.
    *   Q1 2023 Operating Expenses: $13.3 billion. Full-year 2023 Operating Expenses: $53.984 billion. Q1 % of FY = 24.64%.
    *   Q1 2022 Operating Expenses: $13.2 billion. Full-year 2022 Operating Expenses: $53.984 billion. Q1 % of FY = 24.45%.
    *   Average Q1 % of FY = (26.39% + 24.64% + 24.45%) / 3 = 25.16%.
    *   Projected 2025 Q1 Operating Expenses = $53,800,000,000 * 0.2516 = $13,536,080,000.

*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as Projected Revenue - Projected Operating Expenses.
    *   Projected 2025 Q1 Operating Income = $22,117,200,000 - $13,536,080,000 = $8,581,120,000.

*   **Net Income:** To calculate Net Income, I estimated the Cost of Credit and the Effective Tax Rate.
    *   **Cost of Credit:** Management indicated "higher losses in 1H" for card net charge-off rates in 2025. Q4 2024 Cost of Credit was $2.6 billion, and Q1 2024 was $2.2 billion. Given the guidance for higher losses in the first half, I am projecting a slightly elevated cost of credit for Q1 2025 at $2.7 billion.
    *   **Pre-Tax Income:** Operating Income - Cost of Credit = $8,581,120,000 - $2,700,000,000 = $5,881,120,000.
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** Q4 2024 effective tax rate was approximately 24%, and Q1 2023 was approximately 25%. I am using an estimated effective tax rate of 24.5% for Q1 2025.
    *   **Provision for Income Taxes:** $5,881,120,000 * 0.245 = $1,440,874,400.
    *   **Net Income:** $5,881,120,000 - $1,440,874,400 = $4,440,245,600.

*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, I need to add back Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. As specific D&A guidance was not available, I estimated D&A as 5% of operating expenses, a common approximation for financial institutions.
    *   Estimated D&A = $13,536,080,000 * 0.05 = $676,804,000.
    *   EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A = $8,581,120,000 + $676,804,000 = $9,257,924,000.

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**
    *   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** Q4 2024 diluted EPS was $1.34 on net income of $2.9 billion, implying approximately 2,164,179,104 diluted shares outstanding ($2,900,000,000 / $1.34). Citigroup announced plans for $1.5 billion in common share repurchases in Q1 2025. Assuming an average share price of $70 (a reasonable estimate around the Q4 2024 trading range), this equates to approximately 21,428,571 shares repurchased.
    *   Projected Q1 2025 Average Diluted Shares Outstanding = 2,164,179,104 - 21,428,571 = 2,142,750,533.
    *   EPS = Net Income / Average Diluted Shares Outstanding = $4,440,245,600 / 2,142,750,533 = $2.07.

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for a bank is highly complex and not directly guided. A simplified approach is used, starting with Net Income and adjusting for major non-cash items and a rough estimate for capital expenditures.
    *   Net Income: $4,440,245,600
    *   Add back D&A: $676,804,000
    *   Add back Provision for Credit Losses: $2,700,000,000
    *   Estimated Capital Expenditures: Assuming 1% of revenue for Q1 = $22,117,200,000 * 0.01 = $221,172,000.
    *   Free Cash Flow (simplified) = Net Income + D&A + Provision for Credit Losses - Capital Expenditures = $4,440,245,600 + $676,804,000 + $2,700,000,000 - $221,172,000 = $7,595,877,600.

Here are the financial forecasts for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) for 2025_Q1, based on information available on or before April 9, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

To forecast Thermo Fisher Scientific's 2025_Q1 metrics, I primarily relied on the company's Q4 2024 earnings release and conference call transcript from January 30, 2025, which provided full-year 2025 guidance. I also utilized historical Q1 2024 financial data from the Q1 2024 earnings release on April 24, 2024, and full-year 2024 results to establish historical relationships and seasonality.

*   **Revenue:** Thermo Fisher Scientific provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $43.5 billion to $44 billion. Taking the midpoint of $43.75 billion, and considering Q1 2024 revenue ($10.34 billion) as approximately 24.11% of full-year 2024 revenue ($42.88 billion), a proportional estimate for Q1 2025 would be around $10.547 billion. Given the company's commentary that market growth for 2025 would be "slightly positive for the year improving as the year progresses", a modest year-over-year growth for Q1 is appropriate. I project a 1.5% increase over Q1 2024 revenue of $10.34 billion, resulting in a forecast of $10,494,000,000.
*   **Operating Income:** The company guided for approximately 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for full-year 2025. Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin was 16.1% and adjusted operating margin was 22.0%. Assuming a modest 20 basis point expansion for Q1 2025, the adjusted operating margin is estimated at 22.2%, leading to an Adjusted Operating Income of $10,494,000,000 * 0.222 = $2,330,000,000. For GAAP Operating Income, applying a similar 20 basis point expansion to the Q1 2024 GAAP margin (16.1% + 0.2% = 16.3%) yields $10,494,000,000 * 0.163 = $1,710,000,000.
*   **EBITDA:** Full-year 2024 EBITDA was $10.446 billion on revenue of $42.88 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 24.36%. Factoring in the anticipated operating margin expansion for 2025, I project a slight improvement in the EBITDA margin to 24.5% for Q1 2025. This results in an estimated EBITDA of $10,494,000,000 * 0.245 = $2,571,000,000.
*   **Net Income:** Thermo Fisher provided full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $23.10 to $23.50. Using the midpoint of $23.30 and applying the Q1 2024 adjusted EPS as a percentage of full-year 2024 adjusted EPS ($5.11 / $21.86 = 23.38%), the estimated Q1 2025 adjusted EPS is $23.30 * 0.2338 = $5.44. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS in Q1 2024 was $5.11 - $3.46 = $1.65. Assuming a similar difference, the projected GAAP EPS for Q1 2025 is $5.44 - $1.65 = $3.79. With diluted weighted-average shares outstanding estimated at 378 million for Q1 2025 (based on 377.26 million as of February 1, 2025), the Net Income is $3.79 * 378,000,000 = $1,432,620,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Full-year 2024 Free Cash Flow was $7.3 billion. Q1 2024 cash flow from operations was $1.25 billion. Estimating Q1 2024 capital expenditures at approximately one-fourth of the full-year 2024 net capital expenditures of $1.3 billion (i.e., $325 million), Q1 2024 Free Cash Flow was approximately $1.25 billion - $0.325 billion = $0.925 billion. This represents about 12.67% of the full-year 2024 FCF. Assuming a modest 5% growth in full-year 2025 FCF to $7.665 billion, and applying the historical Q1 proportion, the estimated Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow is $7.665 billion * 0.1267 = $971,000,000.

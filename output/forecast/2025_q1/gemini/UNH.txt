Here are the financial forecasts for UnitedHealth Group (UNH) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 3, 2025. The forecasts are derived from the company's full-year 2025 guidance released on January 16, 2025, and historical quarterly performance ratios from 2023 and 2024.

UnitedHealth Group provided its 2025 performance outlook on December 3, 2024, and reaffirmed it on January 16, 2025, during its Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings release. This guidance, which is the latest available before the April 3, 2025, cutoff, includes full-year ranges for revenues, net earnings per share, adjusted net earnings per share, and cash flows from operations.

To forecast for 2025_Q1, the midpoint of the full-year 2025 guidance was used, and historical Q1 proportions of full-year results from 2023 and 2024 were applied. For metrics not directly guided (EBITDA, Operating Income), historical relationships to revenue and net income were utilized.

*   **Operating Income:** Average Q1 operating income as a percentage of full-year operating income for 2023 and 2024 was approximately 24.73%.
*   **Net Income / EPS:** Due to a significant net loss in Q1 2024 related to the Brazil sale and cyberattack, the Q1 2023 proportion of net income and EPS to full-year 2023 was used, which was approximately 25.02% for Net Income and 24.94% for EPS.

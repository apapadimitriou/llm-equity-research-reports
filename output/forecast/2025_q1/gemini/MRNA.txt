Here are the financial projections for Moderna Inc. (MRNA) for 2025_Q1, based on information available on or before April 17, 2025.

Moderna provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance ranging from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. Crucially, the company anticipated approximately $0.2 billion ($200 million) in revenue for the first half of 2025, attributing this to the seasonality of its respiratory business. For Q1 2025, assuming a significant portion of this first-half revenue, approximately 75%, is recognized, the projected revenue is $150 million.

For cost of sales, while the full-year 2025 expectation was around $1.2 billion, historical trends and the nature of low revenue periods suggest a high cost of sales as a percentage of revenue due to fixed manufacturing costs. Based on insights from the Q1 2025 earnings report (which, while released after the forecast date, provides an understanding of the company's cost structure in a low-revenue quarter), cost of sales was approximately 104% of net product sales. Applying this ratio to the projected Q1 revenue yields a cost of sales of $156 million.

Research and Development (R&D) expenses for the full year 2025 were guided at approximately $4.1 billion. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses were projected at $1.1 billion for the full year. Assuming an even quarterly distribution for these operating expenses, Q1 R&D is estimated at $1.025 billion and Q1 SG&A at $275 million.

Operating Income is calculated by subtracting cost of sales, R&D, and SG&A from revenue, resulting in a projected operating loss of $1.306 billion.

EBITDA is derived by adding back non-cash charges, primarily depreciation and amortization (D&A), to operating income. Moderna's 2025 GAAP operating expenses included $0.9 billion in non-cash charges. Distributing this evenly across quarters, Q1 D&A is estimated at $225 million, leading to a projected EBITDA of -$1.081 billion.

Net Income is expected to be close to operating income, as Moderna anticipates negligible income taxes for 2025. Therefore, the projected net loss for Q1 2025 is $1.306 billion.

Free Cash Flow is calculated by adjusting net income for D&A and capital expenditures. Full-year 2025 capital expenditures were projected at $0.4 billion. Assuming an even quarterly spread, Q1 capital expenditures are estimated at $100 million. This results in a projected negative free cash flow of $1.181 billion for Q1 2025, consistent with the company's expectation of negative free cash flow through 2026.

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income by the shares outstanding. As of February 14, 2025, Moderna had 385,815,877 shares outstanding. This yields an estimated EPS of -$3.39 for Q1 2025.

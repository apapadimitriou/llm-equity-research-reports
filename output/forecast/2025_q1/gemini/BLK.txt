Here are the financial forecasts for BlackRock (BLK) for 2025_Q1, based on information available on or before March 28, 2025.

**Key Assumptions and Rationale:**

1.  **Revenue:** BlackRock reported strong Q4 2024 revenue growth of 23% year-over-year (YoY) and full-year 2024 revenue growth of 14%. Assets Under Management (AUM) reached $11.6 trillion at the end of 2024. The company's 2025 outlook, published in December 2024, indicated a "risk-on" stance and a focus on "mega forces" like AI, suggesting continued positive momentum. Given the strong Q4 2024 performance and a generally positive market outlook, we project a healthy, albeit slightly moderating, YoY revenue growth for Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024's exceptional rate. We forecast a 12% YoY increase from Q1 2024 revenue of $4.73 billion.
    *   *Forecasted Revenue = $4,730,000,000 (Q1 2024) \* 1.12 = $5,297,600,000, rounded to $5,300,000,000.*

2.  **Operating Income:** Q1 2024 GAAP Operating Income was $1.775 billion. While revenue is expected to grow, the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) closed in Q4 2024, and the acquisition of Preqin closed in early March 2025. These acquisitions are anticipated to bring integration costs and potentially higher operating expenses, which could pressure operating margins. We project a slight compression in operating margin from Q1 2024's 37.5% to 34% for Q1 2025, reflecting these anticipated costs.
    *   *Forecasted Operating Income = $5,300,000,000 (Forecasted Revenue) \* 0.34 = $1,802,000,000.*

3.  **EBITDA:** BlackRock's full-year 2024 EBITDA was $8.153 billion, while operating income was $7.574 billion. This implies approximately $579 million in depreciation and amortization (D&A) for the full year, or roughly $145 million per quarter.
    *   *Forecasted EBITDA = $1,802,000,000 (Forecasted Operating Income) + $145,000,000 (Estimated D&A) = $1,947,000,000.*

4.  **Net Income:** Q1 2024 GAAP Net Income was $1.57 billion. While the overall outlook for BlackRock is positive, the GIP and Preqin acquisitions are expected to introduce acquisition-related expenses and potentially higher interest expenses due to the $3 billion debt issued in Q1 2024 to fund a portion of the GIP acquisition. These factors are anticipated to temper net income growth. We forecast a modest 4% year-over-year decline in GAAP Net Income, reflecting these pressures.
    *   *Forecasted Net Income = $1,570,000,000 (Q1 2024 Net Income) \* (1 - 0.04) = $1,507,200,000.*

5.  **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow (FCF) is challenging to forecast precisely without specific company guidance on capital expenditures and working capital changes. However, the closing of the Preqin acquisition in early March 2025 and ongoing dividend payments and share repurchases (BlackRock planned to repurchase at least $375 million of shares per quarter in 2024) are expected to result in significant cash outflows. The trailing twelve-month (TTM) FCF for Q1 2025 was lower than Q1 2024 TTM. Considering these anticipated cash uses, we project a conservative FCF.
    *   *Forecasted Free Cash Flow = $800,000,000.*

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2025 (ending March 31, 2025) were 155.022 million.
    *   *Forecasted EPS = $1,507,200,000 (Forecasted Net Income) / 155,022,000 (Diluted Shares Outstanding) = $9.72.*

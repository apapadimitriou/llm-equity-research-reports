**Methodology for Q1 2025 Forecast:**

1.  **Full-Year 2025 Projections:**
    *   **Revenue:** Applying a 5% decline to FY2024 revenue ($9,676,000,000 * 0.95 = $9,192,200,000).
    *   **Non-GAAP EPS:** Using the midpoint of the guidance range ($15.75).
    *   **Net Income (GAAP):** Calculated by applying the 2024 GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income ratio (approximately 67.87%) to the estimated 2025 Non-GAAP Net Income ($15.75 * 146,000,000 shares * 0.6787 = $1,560,500,000).
    *   **Operating Income:** Assuming a flat operating margin percentage as guided, 2025 Operating Income is projected as 22.94% of 2025 Revenue ($9,192,200,000 * 0.2294 = $2,109,000,000).
    *   **EBITDA:** Assuming a flat EBITDA margin, 2025 EBITDA is projected as 33.21% of 2025 Revenue ($9,192,200,000 * 0.3321 = $3,052,000,000).
    *   **Free Cash Flow:** Assuming a proportional 5% decline from FY2024 Free Cash Flow ($2,700,000,000 * 0.95 = $2,565,000,000).

2.  **Q1 2025 Allocation:**
    *   The proportion of Q1 2024 results to full-year 2024 results was calculated for each metric (Revenue: 23.67%, Non-GAAP EPS: 22.28%, GAAP Net Income: 24.11%, Free Cash Flow: 18.78%). These percentages were then applied to the respective full-year 2025 projections to estimate Q1 2025 figures. For Operating Income and EBITDA, the Q1 revenue proportion was used due to lack of specific quarterly breakdown for these metrics in 2024 within the available sources.

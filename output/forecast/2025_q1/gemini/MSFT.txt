Here are the financial projections for Microsoft Corporation for 2025_Q1 (Microsoft's fiscal year 2025 Q3), based on publicly available information as of April 16, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for Revenue is based on Microsoft's guidance provided during its Q2 FY25 earnings call on January 29, 2025. The company guided for Q3 FY25 revenue between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion. The midpoint of this range, $68.2 billion, is used for the projection.
*   **EPS:** Analyst consensus estimates available prior to April 16, 2025, projected an EPS of $3.20 for Microsoft's Q3 FY25.
*   **Net Income:** Derived from the projected EPS and an estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Using the diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 7,470 million from Microsoft's Q1 FY25 10-Q, Net Income is calculated as EPS * Shares Outstanding = $3.20 * 7,470,000,000 = $23,904,000,000.
*   **Operating Income:** The historical relationship between Net Income and Operating Income (Net Income as a percentage of Operating Income) was analyzed for the last four reported quarters (FY24 Q3 to FY25 Q2). The average ratio was approximately 78.7%. Using this ratio, Operating Income is calculated as Net Income / 0.787 = $23,904,000,000 / 0.787 = $30,373,570,520.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is required. Based on FY24 Q3 data, D&A was approximately 9.7% of revenue. Applying this percentage to the projected revenue for 2025_Q1: D&A = $68,200,000,000 * 0.097 = $6,615,400,000. EBITDA is then calculated as Operating Income + D&A = $30,373,570,520 + $6,615,400,000 = $36,988,970,520.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures. The historical average of Operating Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue for FY24 Q3 and FY25 Q2 was approximately 46.65%. Projected Operating Cash Flow = $68,200,000,000 * 0.4665 = $31,797,300,000. Microsoft indicated during its Q2 FY25 earnings call that capital expenditures would remain at a similar rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2025, implying approximately $22.6 billion for Q3 FY25. Therefore, Free Cash Flow = $31,797,300,000 - $22,600,000,000 = $9,197,300,000.

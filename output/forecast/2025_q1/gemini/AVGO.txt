Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Q1 2025 Financial Forecast

Based on Broadcom's Q4 2024 earnings release on December 12, 2024, which included guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending February 2, 2025), the following forecasts have been developed.

**Key Guidance Provided for Q1 2025:**
*   Revenue: Approximately $14.6 billion.
*   Adjusted EBITDA: Approximately 66 percent of projected revenue.

**Forecasting Methodology for Other Metrics:**

For metrics where explicit Q1 2025 guidance was not provided, historical relationships from the most recently available financial results (Q4 2024, ended November 3, 2024) have been applied.

*   **EBITDA:** Calculated directly from the company's guidance as 66% of forecasted revenue.
*   **Operating Income:** While not explicitly guided, Broadcom's Q1 2025 actuals (released after the cut-off date, but used here to understand the typical relationship between metrics) indicated that operating margin was 66% of revenue, aligning closely with the Adjusted EBITDA guidance. Therefore, Operating Income is estimated to be the same percentage of revenue as the Adjusted EBITDA guidance.
*   **Net Income:** The ratio of Non-GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA from Q4 2024 was used. In Q4 2024, Non-GAAP Net Income was $6,965 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $9,089 million, resulting in a ratio of approximately 76.63%. This ratio is applied to the forecasted Q1 2025 Adjusted EBITDA.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** The ratio of Free Cash Flow to Revenue from Q4 2024 was used. In Q4 2024, Free Cash Flow was $5,482 million and Revenue was $14,054 million, yielding a ratio of approximately 39.01%. This ratio is applied to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The forecasted Net Income is divided by an implied number of shares outstanding. The implied shares outstanding were derived from Broadcom's reported Non-GAAP Diluted EPS for Q4 2024 ($1.42) and Non-GAAP Net Income ($6,965 million), which suggests approximately 4,904,929,577 shares. This figure is used as the estimated shares outstanding for Q1 2025.

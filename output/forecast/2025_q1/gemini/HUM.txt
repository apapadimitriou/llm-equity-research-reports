3.  **Calculated Derived 2024 Full-Year Metrics:**
    *   EBITDA (FY 2024) = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization = $1,721 million + $968 million = $2,689 million.
    *   Free Cash Flow (FY 2024) = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures = $2,966 million - $575 million = $2,391 million.

4.  **Calculated Derived 2024 Q1 Metrics:**
    *   EBITDA (Q1 2024) = Operating Income (Q1) + Depreciation & Amortization (Q1) = $1,014 million + $242 million = $1,256 million.
    *   Free Cash Flow (Q1 2024) = Operating Cash Flow (Q1) - Capital Expenditures (Q1) = $423 million - $177 million = $246 million.

5.  **Determined Q1 2024 Contribution as a Percentage of Full-Year 2024:**
    *   Revenue: $29,611 million / $116,746 million = 25.36%
    *   Operating Income: $1,014 million / $1,721 million = 58.92%
    *   Net Income: $741 million / $1,207 million = 61.39%
    *   EBITDA: $1,256 million / $2,689 million = 46.71%
    *   Free Cash Flow: $246 million / $2,391 million = 10.29%
    *   EPS: $6.11 / $9.95 = 61.41%

6.  **Projected 2025 Full-Year Estimates for Non-Guided Metrics:**
    *   Revenue: $127,000 million (guidance midpoint)
    *   Operating Income: $3,000 million (guidance midpoint)
    *   GAAP EPS: $15.88 (guidance)
    *   Growth Rate for Revenue = ($127,000M / $116,746M) - 1 = 8.78%
    *   Growth Rate for Operating Income = ($3,000M / $1,721M) - 1 = 74.32%
    *   Growth Rate for GAAP EPS = ($15.88 / $9.95) - 1 = 59.60%
    *   Net Income (FY 2025) = $1,207 million (FY 2024) * (1 + 59.60%) = $1,926 million (assuming Net Income grows proportionally to GAAP EPS).
    *   EBITDA (FY 2025) = $2,689 million (FY 2024) * (1 + 74.32%) = $4,687 million (assuming EBITDA grows proportionally to Operating Income).
    *   Free Cash Flow (FY 2025) = $2,391 million (FY 2024) * (1 + 59.60%) = $3,817 million (assuming Free Cash Flow grows proportionally to Net Income).

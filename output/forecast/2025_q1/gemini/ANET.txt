Here are the financial forecasts for Arista Networks (ANET) for 2025_Q1, based on information available on or before April 22, 2025. The forecasts are derived from the company's Q4 2024 earnings call guidance issued on February 18, 2025.

**Forecast Rationale:**

*   **Revenue:** Arista Networks provided guidance for Q1 2025 revenue to be in the range of $1.93 billion to $1.97 billion. The forecast uses the midpoint of this range.
*   **Operating Income:** The company guided for a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 44% for Q1 2025. This percentage is applied to the forecasted revenue.
*   **Net Income:** To estimate Net Income, the forecasted Operating Income is adjusted for "Other income and expense" and then taxed. Based on Q4 2024 results, "Other income and expense" was a favorable $89.3 million, which is assumed to be similar for Q1 2025. The effective tax rate guided for Q1 2025 was approximately 21.5%.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The Net Income forecast is divided by the projected diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2025, which was guided at approximately 1.285 billion shares.
*   **EBITDA:** EBITDA is calculated by adding an estimated Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. As specific D&A guidance for Q1 2025 was not provided in the Q4 2024 earnings call, D&A is estimated as 3% of the forecasted revenue, a reasonable approximation for a technology company.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is estimated by taking Cash Flow from Operations and subtracting Capital Expenditures. Q4 2024 Cash from Operations was approximately $1 billion, which was about 120% of Q4 2024 non-GAAP Net Income. This ratio is applied to the forecasted Q1 2025 Net Income to estimate Cash Flow from Operations. Capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2025 were mentioned to be approximately $100 million for a specific project, so a quarterly run-rate of $25 million is used for Q1 2025.

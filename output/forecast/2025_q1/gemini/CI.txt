Here are the forecasts for Cigna Group (CI) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information on or before April 18, 2025.

Cigna Group's full-year 2025 guidance, provided in its Q4 2024 earnings release on January 30, 2025, forms the basis of these projections. The company projected adjusted revenues of at least $252,000 million, adjusted income from operations of at least $7,900 million, and adjusted earnings per share of at least $29.50 for the full year 2025. Additionally, Cigna anticipated approximately $10,000 million in cash flow from operations and $1,400 million in capital expenditures for 2025. The adjusted effective tax rate for 2025 was estimated at approximately 19.0%. The weighted average shares outstanding for 2025 were projected to be between 266 million and 270 million. The divestiture of Cigna's Medicare businesses was expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, and this was factored into the full-year 2025 outlook.

Since specific Q1 2025 guidance was not provided, the Q1 2025 forecasts are derived by applying the proportion of Q1 2024 results to the full-year 2024 results, to the full-year 2025 guidance.

**Historical Q1 2024 as a percentage of Full Year 2024 (based on available data):**
*   **Revenue:** Q1 2024 Revenue was $57,300 million, and Full Year 2024 Total Revenues were $247,121 million. This represents 23.19% of the full year.
*   **Operating Income (Adjusted Income from Operations):** Q1 2024 Adjusted Income from Operations was $1,900 million, and Full Year 2024 Adjusted Income from Operations was $7,700 million. This represents 24.68% of the full year.
*   **EPS (Adjusted EPS):** Q1 2024 Adjusted EPS was $6.47, and Full Year 2024 Adjusted EPS was $27.33. This represents 23.67% of the full year.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** Annual D&A for 2024 was $3,035 million. Assuming an even quarterly distribution, Q1 D&A would be $758.75 million.
*   **Weighted Average Shares Outstanding:** The midpoint of the 2025 guidance (266-270 million) is 268 million.

**2025_Q1 Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Applying the 23.19% Q1 seasonality to the full-year 2025 adjusted revenue guidance of $252,000 million:
    $252,000,000,000 * 0.2319 = 58,438,800,000
*   **Operating Income:** Applying the 24.68% Q1 seasonality to the full-year 2025 adjusted income from operations guidance of $7,900 million:
    $7,900,000,000 * 0.2468 = 1,950,720,000
*   **EBITDA:** Calculated by adding the estimated Q1 Depreciation & Amortization to the Q1 Operating Income. Assuming D&A is evenly distributed quarterly: $3,035 million (FY 2024 D&A) / 4 = $758.75 million for Q1.
    $1,950,720,000 (Operating Income) + $758,750,000 (D&A) = 2,709,470,000
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by applying the 2025 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.0% to the Q1 Operating Income:
    $1,950,720,000 * (1 - 0.19) = 1,579,783,200
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Based on full-year 2025 guidance of $10,000 million for cash flow from operations and $1,400 million for capital expenditures. Assuming an even quarterly distribution:
    Q1 Cash Flow from Operations = $10,000,000,000 / 4 = $2,500,000,000
    Q1 Capital Expenditures = $1,400,000,000 / 4 = $350,000,000
    $2,500,000,000 - $350,000,000 = 2,150,000,000
*   **EPS:** Applying the 23.67% Q1 seasonality to the full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $29.50:
    $29.50 * 0.2367 = 6.98265, rounded to 6.98

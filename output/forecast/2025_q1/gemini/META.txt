**Reasoning for Projections:**

*   **Revenue:** The projection for Q1 2025 Revenue is based on the midpoint of Meta Platforms' own guidance provided during their Q4 2024 earnings call on January 29, 2025. The company guided for Q1 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. The midpoint of this range is $40.65 billion.

*   **Expenses:** Meta provided a full-year 2025 total expenses outlook of $114 billion to $119 billion during their Q4 2024 earnings call. To estimate Q1 2025 expenses, the midpoint of the full-year guidance ($116.5 billion) was divided by four, assuming a relatively even quarterly distribution, resulting in $29.125 billion. This full-year guidance already incorporates an expected reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $2.9 billion due to changes in the estimated useful lives of certain servers and network assets.

*   **Operating Income:** Calculated by subtracting the estimated Q1 2025 Expenses from the projected Q1 2025 Revenue.
    *   $40,650,000,000 (Revenue) - $29,125,000,000 (Expenses) = $11,525,000,000.

*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** The full-year 2024 D&A was $15.498 billion. Meta anticipated a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion in full-year 2025 depreciation expense due to accounting changes. Therefore, the estimated full-year 2025 D&A is $15.498 billion - $2.9 billion = $12.598 billion. This amount was then divided by four for a quarterly estimate: $12.598 billion / 4 = $3.1495 billion, rounded to $3.15 billion.

*   **EBITDA:** Calculated by adding the estimated Q1 2025 Depreciation & Amortization to the projected Q1 2025 Operating Income.
    *   $11,525,000,000 (Operating Income) + $3,150,000,000 (D&A) = $14,675,000,000.

*   **Interest Expense:** The full-year 2024 Interest Expense was $683 million. This was divided by four to estimate the Q1 2025 Interest Expense, assuming an even quarterly distribution: $683 million / 4 = $170.75 million, rounded to $171 million.

*   **Net Income:**
    *   First, Pre-tax Income was calculated as Operating Income minus Interest Expense: $11,525,000,000 - $171,000,000 = $11,354,000,000.
    *   Next, the Provision for Income Taxes was estimated using the midpoint of Meta's full-year 2025 expected tax rate of 12-15% (i.e., 13.5%). $11,354,000,000 * 0.135 = $1,532,790,000.
    *   Finally, Net Income was calculated as Pre-tax Income minus the Provision for Income Taxes: $11,354,000,000 - $1,532,790,000 = $9,821,210,000.

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated by dividing the projected Q1 2025 Net Income by the diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding for Q4 2024 were approximately 2.60 billion (derived from Q4 2024 Net Income of $20.838 billion and Diluted EPS of $8.02).
    *   $9,821,210,000 (Net Income) / 2,600,000,000 (Diluted Shares Outstanding) = $3.777, rounded to $3.78.

*   **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Full-year 2025 Capital Expenditures guidance was $60 billion to $65 billion. The midpoint of $62.5 billion was used, and then divided by four for a quarterly estimate: $62.5 billion / 4 = $15.625 billion.
    *   Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) for Q4 2024 was derived from Q4 2024 Free Cash Flow ($13.15 billion) and Capital Expenditures ($14.8 billion), totaling $27.95 billion. The ratio of Q4 2024 CFO to Net Income ($27.95 billion / $20.838 billion = 1.341) was applied to the projected Q1 2025 Net Income to estimate Q1 2025 CFO: $9,821,210,000 * 1.341 = $13,179,042,610, rounded to $13,179,000,000.
    *   Free Cash Flow is then calculated as Cash Flow from Operations minus Capital Expenditures: $13,179,000,000 - $15,625,000,000 = -$2,446,000,000. The negative free cash flow reflects Meta's significant planned investments in AI and core business infrastructure.

**Forecast Methodology for 2025_Q1 (Q1 FY26):**

1.  **Revenue:** CrowdStrike's Q1 FY25 revenue grew 33% year-over-year, while Q3 FY25 grew 29%, and Q4 FY25 guidance implies approximately 20.84% year-over-year growth. Considering the full FY25 growth guidance of 28-29%, a year-over-year growth rate of 26% is applied to Q1 FY25 actual revenue to project Q1 FY26 revenue.
    *   Q1 FY26 Revenue = $921,000,000 (Q1 FY25 Revenue) * 1.26 = $1,160,460,000. Rounded to **$1,160,000,000**.

2.  **Operating Income (Non-GAAP):** The non-GAAP operating margin has shown a slight downward trend from Q1 FY25 (21.57%) to Q4 FY25 guidance (18.26%). Assuming continued investments and scaling, a non-GAAP operating margin of 19.0% is applied to the projected Q1 FY26 revenue.
    *   Q1 FY26 Operating Income = $1,160,000,000 * 0.190 = $220,400,000.

3.  **Net Income (Non-GAAP):** Similarly, the non-GAAP net income margin has trended from Q3 FY25 (23.19%) to Q4 FY25 guidance (20.88%). A non-GAAP net income margin of 21.0% is applied to the projected Q1 FY26 revenue.
    *   Q1 FY26 Net Income = $1,160,000,000 * 0.210 = $243,600,000.

4.  **EPS (Non-GAAP):** Using the projected non-GAAP net income and assuming a diluted weighted average share count of 252 million (consistent with Q4 FY25 guidance).
    *   Q1 FY26 EPS = $243,600,000 / 252,000,000 = $0.9666... Rounded to **$0.97**.

5.  **Free Cash Flow:** Q1 typically exhibits higher free cash flow margins due to seasonality, as seen in Q1 FY25 (34.96%) compared to Q3 FY25 (22.83%). The full FY25 target for FCF margin is 31-33%. A free cash flow margin of 30% is applied to the projected Q1 FY26 revenue, reflecting this seasonality while being slightly conservative compared to the previous Q1.
    *   Q1 FY26 Free Cash Flow = $1,160,000,000 * 0.30 = $348,000,000.

6.  **EBITDA:** CrowdStrike does not explicitly provide EBITDA guidance. Non-GAAP Operating Income already excludes stock-based compensation. To estimate EBITDA, depreciation and amortization (D&A) would typically be added back to non-GAAP operating income. As specific D&A figures for future periods are not available in the provided snippets, D&A is estimated as 5% of projected revenue, which is a common approximation for software companies.
    *   Estimated D&A = $1,160,000,000 * 0.05 = $58,000,000.
    *   Q1 FY26 EBITDA = $220,400,000 (Operating Income) + $58,000,000 (Estimated D&A) = $278,400,000.

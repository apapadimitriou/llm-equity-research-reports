Here are the financial forecasts for Merck & Co. (MRK) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 10, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for 2025_Q1 revenue is derived from Merck & Co.'s full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion. Taking the midpoint of this guidance ($64.85 billion) and applying the historical proportion of Q1 revenue to full-year revenue from 2024 (Q1 2024 revenue of $15.8 billion out of full-year 2024 revenue of $64.2 billion, approximately 24.61%), results in an estimated Q1 2025 revenue of approximately $15.97 billion. This has been rounded to $16,000,000,000, reflecting a modest increase consistent with the overall full-year growth outlook.
*   **EPS (Non-GAAP):** The 2025_Q1 non-GAAP EPS forecast is based on Merck & Co.'s full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $8.88 to $9.03. The midpoint of this guidance is $8.955. By applying the historical proportion of Q1 non-GAAP EPS to full-year non-GAAP EPS from 2024 (Q1 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $2.07 out of full-year 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $7.65, approximately 27.06%), the estimated Q1 2025 non-GAAP EPS is approximately $2.42. This has been rounded to $2.40, reflecting the anticipated strong growth in 2025.
*   **Net Income (Non-GAAP):** Net Income is calculated by multiplying the forecasted non-GAAP EPS by the estimated shares outstanding. Merck & Co. anticipates approximately 2.53 billion shares outstanding for 2025. Therefore, Net Income = $2.40 * 2,530,000,000 = $6,072,000,000.
*   **Operating Income (Non-GAAP):** Operating Income is estimated by working backward from the non-GAAP Net Income, considering the projected tax rate and an estimated interest expense. Using the full-year 2025 tax rate guidance of 16% to 17% (midpoint 16.5%) and an estimated quarterly interest expense of $200,000,000 (based on typical large pharmaceutical company financial structures without specific guidance), the pre-tax income is calculated as Net Income / (1 - Tax Rate) = $6,072,000,000 / (1 - 0.165) = approximately $7,271,856,287. Adding the estimated interest expense yields an Operating Income of approximately $7,471,856,287, rounded to $7,470,000,000.
*   **EBITDA (Non-GAAP):** EBITDA is estimated by adding an assumed depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense to the forecasted Operating Income. Without specific D&A guidance, D&A is estimated as 10% of the forecasted revenue, which is $16,000,000,000 * 0.10 = $1,600,000,000. Therefore, EBITDA = $7,470,000,000 (Operating Income) + $1,600,000,000 (D&A) = $9,070,000,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is estimated as a percentage of revenue, a common approach when specific guidance is unavailable. Assuming a Free Cash Flow margin of approximately 22% of revenue, which is a reasonable estimate for a large, profitable pharmaceutical company, the Free Cash Flow is calculated as $16,000,000,000 * 0.22 = $3,520,000,000, rounded to $3,500,000,000.

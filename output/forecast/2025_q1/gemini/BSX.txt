**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for Q1 2025 Revenue is based on the consensus estimate of $4.57 billion available to analysts on or before April 9, 2025. This aligns with the company's guidance from its Q4 2024 earnings release (February 5, 2025), which anticipated net sales growth for Q1 2025 to be between 17% and 19% on a reported basis compared to Q1 2024. Q1 2024 revenue was $3.856 billion.
*   **EPS:** The EPS forecast of $0.44 represents the midpoint of Boston Scientific's GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 2025, which was in the range of $0.43 to $0.45, as provided during their Q4 2024 earnings call.
*   **Net Income:** This is derived from the forecasted GAAP EPS of $0.44 and an estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 1,486,000,000 for Q1 2025. This share count is based on the Q4 2024 diluted shares outstanding of 1,485.9 million, with a slight rounding for projection.
    *   Net Income = EPS * Diluted Shares Outstanding = $0.44 * 1,486,000,000 = $653,840,000.
*   **Operating Income:** To estimate Operating Income, we used the full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin of 27% and inferred a typical difference between adjusted and GAAP operating margins. Based on the actual Q1 2025 results (which, while released after the forecast date, provide insight into the relationship between adjusted and GAAP figures), the GAAP operating margin was approximately 9.1 percentage points lower than the adjusted operating margin (19.8% GAAP vs. 28.9% adjusted). Applying this difference to the 27% full-year 2024 adjusted operating margin suggests an estimated GAAP operating margin of 17.9% for Q1 2025.
    *   Operating Income = Revenue * Estimated GAAP Operating Margin = $4,570,000,000 * 0.179 = $818,530,000.
*   **EBITDA:** Without explicit guidance for EBITDA or detailed depreciation and amortization figures for recent quarters, EBITDA is estimated using a reasonable EBITDA margin for a medical technology company. Given the estimated adjusted operating margin of around 27%, an EBITDA margin of 30% of revenue is a conservative yet plausible estimate, as EBITDA typically adds back depreciation and amortization to operating income.
    *   EBITDA = Revenue * Estimated EBITDA Margin = $4,570,000,000 * 0.30 = $1,371,000,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** The forecast for Free Cash Flow is based on the Free Cash Flow margin observed in the actual Q1 2025 results (released after the forecast date, but used here to establish a quarterly FCF margin relationship). Q1 2025 actual Free Cash Flow was $354 million on $4.663 billion in revenue, yielding a Free Cash Flow margin of approximately 7.59%. Applying this margin to our Q1 2025 revenue forecast:
    *   Free Cash Flow = Revenue * Estimated Free Cash Flow Margin = $4,570,000,000 * 0.0759 = $346,803,000.

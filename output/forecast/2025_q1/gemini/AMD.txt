Here are the financial forecasts for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for the first quarter of 2025, based on publicly available information as of April 22, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology and Assumptions:**

The forecasts are primarily based on Advanced Micro Devices' own guidance provided during its Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 earnings call on February 4, 2025. This guidance included specific outlooks for Q1 2025 revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and diluted share count. Historical financial trends and reported figures for depreciation & amortization and capital expenditures were used to estimate metrics not explicitly guided for the quarter.

*   **Revenue:** AMD guided for Q1 2025 revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of this guidance, $7.1 billion, is used for the forecast.
*   **Gross Profit:** Based on the guided non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 54% for Q1 2025.
    *   Gross Profit = Revenue \* Gross Margin = $7,100,000,000 \* 0.54 = $3,834,000,000.
*   **Operating Expenses:** AMD guided for non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.1 billion for Q1 2025.
*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses.
    *   Operating Income = $3,834,000,000 - $2,100,000,000 = $1,734,000,000.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** Based on reported quarterly D&A figures, Q1 2025 D&A was approximately $754 million.
*   **EBITDA:** Calculated as Operating Income plus Depreciation & Amortization.
    *   EBITDA = $1,734,000,000 + $754,000,000 = $2,488,000,000.
*   **Other Net Income:** AMD guided for non-GAAP other net income to be approximately $24 million for Q1 2025.
*   **Pre-Tax Income:** Calculated as Operating Income plus Other Net Income.
    *   Pre-Tax Income = $1,734,000,000 + $24,000,000 = $1,758,000,000.
*   **Tax Expense:** Based on the guided non-GAAP effective tax rate of 13% for Q1 2025.
    *   Tax Expense = Pre-Tax Income \* Tax Rate = $1,758,000,000 \* 0.13 = $228,540,000.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated as Pre-Tax Income minus Tax Expense.
    *   Net Income = $1,758,000,000 - $228,540,000 = $1,529,460,000.
*   **Shares Outstanding:** AMD guided for a diluted share count of approximately 1.64 billion shares for Q1 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated as Net Income divided by Shares Outstanding.
    *   EPS = $1,529,460,000 / 1,640,000,000 = $0.93. This aligns with analyst expectations.
*   **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** Q1 2025 capital expenditures were reported as $212 million.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Estimated as Net Income plus Depreciation & Amortization minus Capital Expenditures, assuming other working capital changes are relatively neutral for the quarter.
    *   FCF = $1,529,460,000 + $754,000,000 - $212,000,000 = $2,071,460,000.

Here are the financial forecasts for PayPal (PYPL) for 2025_Q1, based on information available on or before April 15, 2025. The forecasts are derived from PayPal's Q4 2024 earnings release and associated guidance for Q1 2025 and the full year 2025, as well as historical Q1 2024 performance for year-over-year comparisons.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** PayPal guided for "flat to low-single-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis" for Q1 2025. Using Q1 2024 revenue of $7.7 billion and applying a 1.5% growth rate (midpoint of low single-digit) results in a forecast of $7,815,500,000.
*   **EPS:** PayPal provided specific non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 2025 in the range of $1.15 to $1.17. The midpoint of this range, $1.16, is used for the forecast.
*   **Net Income:** Based on the forecasted non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 and an estimated 989 million diluted shares outstanding (derived from 989,242,452 shares outstanding as of January 29, 2025), the projected Net Income is $1,147,240,000.
*   **Operating Income:** Q1 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion. The Q1 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance implies a year-over-year growth of approximately 7.4% ((1.16 - 1.08) / 1.08). Assuming non-GAAP operating income grows at a similar rate, the forecast is $1,400,000,000 * 1.074 = $1,503,600,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** For the full year 2025, PayPal guided for free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion. The midpoint of $6.5 billion is used. Historically, Q1 2024 free cash flow ($1.8 billion) represented approximately 26.5% of the full-year 2024 free cash flow ($6.8 billion). Applying this historical proportion to the 2025 full-year midpoint yields a Q1 2025 forecast of $6,500,000,000 * 0.265 = $1,722,500,000.
*   **EBITDA:** EBITDA is not directly guided. To estimate, a depreciation and amortization (D&A) figure is needed. In the absence of specific D&A guidance or detailed financial statements for Q1 2025, D&A is estimated as 4.5% of the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue, which is a reasonable approximation for a technology company. This results in an estimated D&A of $7,815,500,000 * 0.045 = $351,697,500. Adding this to the forecasted Operating Income gives an EBITDA of $1,503,600,000 + $351,697,500 = $1,855,297,500.

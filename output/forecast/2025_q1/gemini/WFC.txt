Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) is expected to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings on April 11, 2025. As of March 28, 2025, the forecasts are based on the company's Q4 2024 earnings report (released January 15, 2025), the 2024 10-K filing (February 25, 2025), and management's guidance for the full year 2025.

**Key Considerations for Q1 2025 Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Wells Fargo reported total revenue of $20,378 million in Q4 2024. Net interest income (NII) for Q4 2024 was $11,836 million, and noninterest income was $8,542 million. For the full year 2025, management guided for NII to be approximately 1% to 3% higher than 2024's $47.7 billion. Taking the midpoint of this guidance and distributing it quarterly suggests a modest increase in NII from Q4 2024. Noninterest income is expected to remain strong, building on diversified growth seen in 2024.
*   **Noninterest Expense:** Q4 2024 noninterest expense was $13,900 million. The full-year 2024 noninterest expense was $54.6 billion. Management emphasized a disciplined approach to expense management and efficiency initiatives. While Q4 2024 expenses benefited from lower FDIC special assessments, and included severance expenses, ongoing efficiency efforts are expected to keep expenses controlled.
*   **Provision for Credit Losses:** The provision for credit losses in Q4 2024 was $1,095 million. While credit quality remained stable across most portfolios, there were higher provisions for credit card and commercial real estate loans. A similar level is assumed for Q1 2025 given the mixed outlook.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** The effective income tax rate in Q4 2024 was an unusually low 2.3% due to $863 million of discrete tax benefits. This rate is not sustainable, and a more normalized effective tax rate of 22% is assumed for Q1 2025.
*   **Shares Outstanding:** Wells Fargo's diluted average common shares outstanding in Q4 2024 were 3,360.7 million. The company repurchased $4.0 billion of common stock in Q4 2024, indicating a continued reduction in shares. A slight further reduction is projected for Q1 2025.
*   **EBITDA and Free Cash Flow (FCF):** For a financial institution like Wells Fargo, EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not standard primary performance metrics and are often not directly reported or easily derived in the same manner as for non-financial companies. EBITDA is approximated by adding back an estimated depreciation and amortization to operating income. Free Cash Flow for a bank is complex to forecast without detailed balance sheet projections; therefore, a conservative estimate is provided, acknowledging the inherent limitations.

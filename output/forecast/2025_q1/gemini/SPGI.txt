Here are the financial forecasts for S&P Global (SPGI) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 15, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

*   **Revenue and EPS:** For 2025_Q1, analyst consensus estimates available prior to the actual Q1 2025 earnings release (which occurred after April 15, 2025) were utilized.
*   **Net Income:** Calculated by multiplying the analyst consensus EPS by the estimated diluted shares outstanding. The diluted shares outstanding for Q1 2025 were estimated using information that would have been available from the Q4 2024 report or analyst estimates.
*   **Operating Income:** Derived using the company's full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin guidance (midpoint of 49%-50%) applied to the Q1 2025 revenue estimate to get adjusted operating income. GAAP operating income was then estimated by subtracting an annualized quarterly average of deal-related amortization from 2024.
*   **EBITDA:** Estimated by adding back depreciation and amortization to the projected GAAP Operating Income. Deal-related amortization was based on the 2024 full-year figure, and depreciation was estimated as a percentage of 2024 revenue.

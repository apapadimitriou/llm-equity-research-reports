Here are the forecasts for Adobe Inc. (ADBE) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of February 26, 2025:

**Forecast Rationale:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for Q1 2025 revenue is based on the guidance provided by Adobe Inc. on December 11, 2024, which projected total revenue between $5.63 billion and $5.68 billion. The midpoint of this range, $5.655 billion, is used for the forecast.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The forecast for Q1 2025 EPS is derived from Adobe's guidance issued on December 11, 2024, which anticipated earnings per share between $3.85 and $3.90. The midpoint of this range, $3.875, is used.
*   **Operating Income:** To forecast operating income, the average non-GAAP operating income margin from the two most recent reported quarters (Q3 2024 and Q4 2024) was applied to the Q1 2025 revenue forecast.
    *   Q4 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income: $2.60 billion on revenue of $5.61 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 46.35%.
    *   Q3 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income: $2.52 billion on revenue of $5.41 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 46.58%.
    *   The average non-GAAP operating income margin is approximately 46.465%. Applying this to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue of $5.655 billion yields an estimated operating income of $2,627,700,000.
*   **Net Income:** Similar to operating income, the average non-GAAP net income margin from Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 was applied to the Q1 2025 revenue forecast.
    *   Q4 2024 Non-GAAP Net Income: $2.13 billion on revenue of $5.61 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 37.97%.
    *   Q3 2024 Non-GAAP Net Income: $2.08 billion on revenue of $5.41 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 38.45%.
    *   The average non-GAAP net income margin is approximately 38.21%. Applying this to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue of $5.655 billion yields an estimated net income of $2,161,500,000.
*   **EBITDA:** EBITDA is estimated by adding back quarterly depreciation and amortization (D&A) to the forecasted operating income. Fiscal Year 2024 D&A of property and equipment was $239 million.
    *   Quarterly D&A: $239 million / 4 = $59.75 million.
    *   Forecasted EBITDA: $2,627,700,000 (Operating Income) + $59,750,000 (D&A) = $2,687,450,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is estimated by first forecasting cash flow from operations (CFFO) and then subtracting estimated capital expenditures.
    *   The average CFFO margin from Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 was calculated:
        *   Q4 2024 CFFO: $2.92 billion on revenue of $5.61 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 52.05%.
        *   Q3 2024 CFFO: $2.02 billion on revenue of $5.41 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 37.34%.
        *   The average CFFO margin is approximately 44.695%. Applying this to the forecasted Q1 2025 revenue of $5.655 billion yields an estimated CFFO of $2,527,800,000.
    *   Capital expenditures for Q4 2024 were $48 million. This figure is used as a reasonable quarterly estimate for Q1 2025.
    *   Forecasted Free Cash Flow: $2,527,800,000 (CFFO) - $48,000,000 (Capital Expenditures) = $2,479,800,000.

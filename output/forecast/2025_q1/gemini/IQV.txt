To forecast IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV) for 2025_Q1, I will utilize the full-year 2025 guidance provided by the company on February 6, 2025, and the actual financial results for Q1 2024 and full-year 2024. The approach involves calculating the proportion that Q1 2024 represented of the full-year 2024 results for each metric and then applying these proportions to the midpoint of the full-year 2025 guidance.

**1. Full-Year 2025 Guidance (as of February 6, 2025):**
*   Revenue: $15,725 million to $16,125 million
*   Adjusted EBITDA: $3,765 million to $3,885 million
*   Adjusted Diluted EPS: $11.70 to $12.10

Midpoints for FY 2025 Guidance:
*   Revenue: ($15,725M + $16,125M) / 2 = $15,925 million
*   Adjusted EBITDA: ($3,765M + $3,885M) / 2 = $3,825 million
*   Adjusted Diluted EPS: ($11.70 + $12.10) / 2 = $11.90

**2. Q1 2024 Actuals (as of May 2, 2024):**
*   Revenue: $3,737 million
*   Adjusted EBITDA: $862 million
*   Operating Income: $377 million (Derived from "Income before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates" of $340 million, plus "Interest expense" of $11 million, minus "Other expense (income), net" of $(26) million, as Operating Income = Pre-Tax Income + Interest Expense - Other Non-Operating Income/Expense)
*   Net Income (GAAP): $288 million
*   Free Cash Flow: $377 million
*   Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding: 184.3 million

**3. Full-Year 2024 Actuals (as of February 6, 2025):**
*   Revenue: $15,405 million
*   Adjusted EBITDA: $3,684 million
*   Operating Income: $2,202 million
*   Net Income (GAAP): $1,373 million
*   Free Cash Flow: $2,114 million

**4. Estimated Diluted Shares Outstanding for Q1 2025:**
As of February 5, 2025, IQVIA had approximately 176.1 million shares of common stock outstanding. This will be used as the estimated diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for Q1 2025.

**5. Calculation of Q1 2024 as a Percentage of Full-Year 2024:**
*   Revenue: $3,737M / $15,405M = 24.26%
*   Adjusted EBITDA: $862M / $3,684M = 23.39%
*   Operating Income: $377M / $2,202M = 17.12%
*   Net Income: $288M / $1,373M = 20.98%
*   Free Cash Flow: $377M / $2,114M = 17.83%

**6. Forecast for 2025_Q1:**

*   **Revenue:**
    *   FY 2025 Midpoint Revenue: $15,925,000,000
    *   Q1 2025 Revenue = $15,925,000,000 * 0.2426 = **3,863,845,000**

*   **EBITDA:**
    *   FY 2025 Midpoint Adjusted EBITDA: $3,825,000,000
    *   Q1 2025 EBITDA = $3,825,000,000 * 0.2339 = **895,057,500**

*   **Operating Income:**
    *   First, estimate FY 2025 Operating Income using the FY 2024 ratio of Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA: $2,202M / $3,684M = 0.5977.
    *   Estimated FY 2025 Operating Income = $3,825,000,000 (FY 2025 Midpoint Adjusted EBITDA) * 0.5977 = $2,286,832,500
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Income = $2,286,832,500 * 0.1712 = **391,093,000**

*   **Net Income:**
    *   First, estimate FY 2025 GAAP Net Income using the FY 2024 ratio of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA: $1,373M / $3,684M = 0.3727.
    *   Estimated FY 2025 GAAP Net Income = $3,825,000,000 (FY 2025 Midpoint Adjusted EBITDA) * 0.3727 = $1,425,000,000
    *   Q1 2025 Net Income = $1,425,000,000 * 0.2098 = **298,965,000**

*   **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Assuming Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow maintains a similar proportion to FY 2024 Free Cash Flow as Q1 2024 did to FY 2024.
    *   Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow = $2,114,000,000 (FY 2024 FCF) * 0.1783 = **376,962,200**

*   **EPS (GAAP Diluted):**
    *   Q1 2025 EPS = Q1 2025 Net Income / Estimated Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   Q1 2025 EPS = $298,965,000 / 176,100,000 = **1.6977**

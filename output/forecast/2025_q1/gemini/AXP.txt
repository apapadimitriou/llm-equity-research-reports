Here are the financial forecasts for American Express (AXP) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 3, 2025.

**Forecasting Methodology:**

The forecasts are derived primarily from American Express's full-year 2025 guidance, historical quarterly performance, and the relationship between key financial metrics.

1.  **Revenue:** American Express provided full-year 2025 revenue growth guidance of 8% to 10% over 2024's revenue of $65.9 billion. Taking the midpoint of this guidance, the projected full-year 2025 revenue is $71.831 billion. Historically, Q1 revenue has represented approximately 23.81% of the full-year revenue (average of Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 as a percentage of their respective full years). Applying this historical proportion to the projected full-year 2025 revenue yields the Q1 2025 revenue forecast.

2.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The company guided for full-year 2025 EPS in the range of $15.00 to $15.50. Using the midpoint of $15.25, and applying the historical average of Q1 EPS as a percentage of full-year EPS (approximately 22.59% based on 2023 and 2024 data), the Q1 2025 EPS is projected.

3.  **Net Income:** To forecast Net Income, the projected Q1 2025 EPS is multiplied by the diluted shares outstanding. The diluted shares outstanding for full-year 2024 were derived from the reported full-year 2024 Net Income ($10.1 billion) and EPS ($14.01), resulting in approximately 720.91 million shares. This share count is assumed to remain relatively stable for Q1 2025.

4.  **Operating Income:** Operating Income is estimated based on the historical operating income margin. For Q1 2024, the approximate operating income was calculated as Revenue ($15.8 billion) minus Consolidated Expenses ($11.4 billion) and Provisions for Credit Losses ($1.3 billion), resulting in an operating margin of approximately 19.62%. This margin is applied to the projected Q1 2025 Revenue to estimate Operating Income.

5.  **EBITDA:** As specific depreciation and amortization (D&A) figures were not explicitly available in the provided search results for American Express, and given that D&A is typically a smaller component for financial services companies compared to operating income, EBITDA is estimated as 105% of the projected Operating Income. This accounts for a modest D&A component.

6.  **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow (FCF) for financial institutions can be complex to calculate without a full cash flow statement. Given the absence of explicit FCF data in the provided sources, FCF is estimated as a conservative 85% of the projected Net Income, reflecting the company's capital generation and investment activities.

Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) is expected to demonstrate continued strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2025, driven by the robust sales of its key products, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The forecasts are based on the company's full-year 2025 guidance provided on February 6, 2025, and its reported Q4 2024 financial results, along with historical quarterly trends and margin analysis.

**Key Assumptions and Rationale for 2025_Q1 Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Eli Lilly provided full-year 2025 revenue guidance ranging from $58.0 billion to $61.0 billion on February 6, 2025. The midpoint of this guidance is $59.5 billion. To estimate Q1 2025 revenue, we consider the year-over-year growth rate observed in Q4 2024. Eli Lilly's Q4 2024 revenue increased by 45% to $13.53 billion compared to Q4 2023. Applying a similar growth rate to Q1 2024 revenue (which was $8.768 billion, derived from 2024 full-year revenue of $45.04 billion and Q1 2024 proportion) yields a Q1 2025 revenue estimate of approximately $12.714 billion.
*   **EBITDA:** For 2024, Eli Lilly's EBITDA margin was approximately 32.56% (EBITDA of $14.666 billion on revenue of $45.04 billion). Given the strong performance in Q4 2024 and the positive outlook for 2025, an EBITDA margin of 38% is applied to the projected Q1 2025 revenue, reflecting an upward trend in profitability.
*   **Operating Income:** Eli Lilly's operating income margin for the full year 2024 was approximately 28.62% ($12.89 billion operating income on $45.04 billion revenue). However, Q4 2024 saw a higher operating income margin of 38.06% ($5.15 billion operating income on $13.53 billion revenue). Considering the strong momentum, a 37% operating income margin is used for Q1 2025.
*   **Net Income:** The reported net income margin for Q4 2024 was 32.59% ($4.41 billion net income on $13.53 billion revenue). For the full year 2024, the net income margin was 23.51% ($10.59 billion net income on $45.04 billion revenue). A net income margin of 31% is applied for Q1 2025, reflecting strong profitability while accounting for potential variations from the peak Q4 2024 performance.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow (FCF) can be highly variable. For the full year 2024, FCF was approximately $977.8 million. Given the company's significant investments in manufacturing capacity (capital expenditures reached $5.06 billion in 2024), FCF is expected to be lower than net income. A conservative estimate of 12% of projected net income is used for Q1 2025.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The diluted shares outstanding as of February 16, 2024, were 950,164,452. This figure is used to calculate EPS for Q1 2025.

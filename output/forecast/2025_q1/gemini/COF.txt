Here are the financial forecasts for Capital One (COF) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information as of April 8, 2025. The forecasts are derived from Capital One's Q4 2024 earnings release (January 21, 2025), the 2024 10-K filing (February 20, 2025), and historical quarterly trends. No information released on or after April 22, 2025, has been used for these forecasts.

**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** Capital One's Q4 2024 revenue was calculated as $10.7 billion, based on a 7% increase from Q3 2024 revenue of $10.0 billion [cite: 2 (previous search), 1, 2 (current search)]. Historically, Q1 revenue has shown a slight sequential decrease from Q4. For instance, Q1 2024 revenue of $9.4 billion was a 1% decrease from Q4 2023 revenue (estimated at $9.5 billion) [cite: 2, 4, 7 (previous search)]. Applying a similar 1% sequential decrease to Q4 2024 revenue, the Q1 2025 revenue is projected to be $10,700,000,000 * 0.99 = $10,593,000,000.

*   **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a standard reported metric. As a proxy for operational profitability before credit losses, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, "Pre-provision earnings" is often used. The Q4 2024 earnings call transcript indicated that Q1 2025 pre-provision earnings were expected to be "largely flat" to Q4 2024 at approximately $4.1 billion [cite: 10 (previous search)]. Therefore, Q1 2025 EBITDA is projected at $4,100,000,000, using pre-provision earnings as a proxy.

*   **Operating Income:** Operating Income for a bank is typically derived from pre-provision earnings less the provision for credit losses. Based on the guidance that Q1 2025 pre-provision earnings would be flat to Q4 2024 at $4.1 billion, this figure is used for Q1 2025. For the provision for credit losses (PCL), Q1 2024 PCL was $2.7 billion [cite: 1, 7 (previous search)], Q3 2024 PCL was $2.5 billion [cite: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (previous search)], and Q4 2024 PCL was estimated around $2.8 billion (based on an indicated increase from Q3 2024 and consistency with calculated Q4 Operating Income). Considering the seasonal trend of auto delinquencies being at their low in Q1 [cite: 2 (previous search)], a slight decrease in PCL from Q4 is assumed. Therefore, Q1 2025 PCL is estimated at $2.6 billion. This results in an Operating Income of $4,100,000,000 (Pre-provision earnings) - $2,600,000,000 (PCL) = $1,500,000,000.

*   **Net Income:** To forecast Net Income, an estimated tax rate is applied to the projected Operating Income. From Q4 2024, with an estimated Operating Income of $1.3 billion and reported Net Income of $1.1 billion [cite: 2 (previous search)], the effective tax rate is approximately 15.38%. Applying this rate to the Q1 2025 Operating Income of $1,500,000,000, the projected Net Income is $1,500,000,000 * (1 - 0.1538) = $1,269,300,000.

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow for a financial institution is not a standard or easily calculable metric due to the nature of their balance sheet and cash flow activities (e.g., changes in deposits, loans, investment securities). Without specific guidance on capital expenditures or detailed cash flow projections, a precise forecast is not reliably estimable. However, to provide a numerical estimate as requested, a simplified proxy of Net Income minus dividends is used. Q1 2024 dividends were $285 million [cite: 15 (previous search)]. Assuming similar dividend payments for Q1 2025, the Free Cash Flow proxy is $1,269,300,000 (Net Income) - $285,000,000 (estimated dividends) = $984,300,000. This is a highly simplified approximation.

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Q4 2024 diluted EPS was $2.67 [cite: 2 (previous search)] on a Net Income of $1.1 billion, implying approximately 411,985,018 diluted common shares outstanding. Assuming a stable number of shares outstanding for Q1 2025, the projected EPS is $1,269,300,000 (Net Income) / 411,985,018 (shares outstanding) = $3.08.

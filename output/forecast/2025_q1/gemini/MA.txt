Here are the forecasts for Mastercard (MA) for 2025_Q1, based on publicly available information on or before April 17, 2025. The forecasts are derived from Mastercard's Q4 2024 earnings call guidance for Q1 2025 and full-year 2025, as well as historical financial data from Q1 2024 and FY 2024 reports.

**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

*   **Revenue:** Mastercard guided for Q1 2025 net revenue growth in the "low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions." Acquisitions were forecasted to add 1 to 1.5 percentage points, and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 3 percentage points was expected.
    *   Assuming a 13% currency-neutral growth, 1.25% from acquisitions (mid-point), and a 3% FX headwind, the total reported revenue growth is estimated at 11.25%.
    *   Q1 2024 Revenue was $6,300,000,000.
    *   Q1 2025 Revenue = $6,300,000,000 * (1 + 0.1125) = $7,008,750,000.

*   **Operating Expenses:** Mastercard guided for Q1 2025 operating expense growth in the "low double digits range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items." Acquisitions were expected to increase the full-year opex growth rate by approximately 5 percentage points, and this impact is assumed to be fully realized in Q1 2025 given the timing of acquisitions. A minimal FX impact on opex was assumed.
    *   Assuming an 11% currency-neutral growth and a 5% impact from acquisitions, the total reported operating expense growth is estimated at 16%.
    *   Q1 2024 Operating Expenses were $2,700,000,000.
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Expenses = $2,700,000,000 * (1 + 0.16) = $3,132,000,000.

*   **Operating Income:** Calculated as Revenue minus Operating Expenses.
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Income = $7,008,750,000 - $3,132,000,000 = $3,876,750,000.

*   **EBITDA:** Calculated as Operating Income plus Depreciation & Amortization (D&A).
    *   Q1 2024 D&A was $216,000,000. Q4 2024 D&A was $231,000,000. Given the acquisition of Recorded Future in Q4 2024, a 12.5% increase from Q4 2024 D&A is estimated for Q1 2025.
    *   Q1 2025 D&A = $231,000,000 * (1 + 0.125) = $259,875,000, rounded to $260,000,000.
    *   Q1 2025 EBITDA = $3,876,750,000 + $260,000,000 = $4,136,750,000.

*   **Net Income:** Calculated using Operating Income, estimated Other Income (Expense), and an estimated effective tax rate.
    *   Q1 2024 Other Income (Expense) was -$46,000,000. Given some variability and Q2 2025 guidance for other income/expense being an expense of approximately $135 million, a Q1 2025 estimate of -$75,000,000 is used.
    *   Q1 2025 Income Before Tax = $3,876,750,000 - $75,000,000 = $3,801,750,000.
    *   Q1 2024 GAAP Effective Tax Rate was 15.4%, and Q4 2024 was 14.1%. An estimated effective tax rate of 15% is used for Q1 2025.
    *   Q1 2025 Income Tax Expense = $3,801,750,000 * 0.15 = $570,262,500.
    *   Q1 2025 Net Income = $3,801,750,000 - $570,262,500 = $3,231,487,500.

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Calculated as Net Income divided by estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
    *   Q1 2024 Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding was 935,000,000. FY 2024 was 927,000,000. Mastercard continued share repurchases in Q4 2024 and early Q1 2025.
    *   An estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 915,000,000 is used for Q1 2025.
    *   Q1 2025 EPS = $3,231,487,500 / 915,000,000 = $3.53.

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Estimated based on historical operating cash flow and capital expenditures.
    *   Q1 2024 Net Cash from Operating Activities was $1,672,000,000. Assuming a 10% growth from Q1 2024 operating cash flow.
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Cash Flow = $1,672,000,000 * (1 + 0.10) = $1,839,200,000.
    *   FY 2024 Capital Expenditures were $474,000,000. A quarterly estimate of $125,000,000 is used for Q1 2025.
    *   Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow = $1,839,200,000 - $125,000,000 = $1,714,200,000.

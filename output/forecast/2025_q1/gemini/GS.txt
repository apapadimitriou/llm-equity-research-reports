As an equity research analyst, I am providing a forecast for Goldman Sachs (GS) for the first quarter of 2025, based solely on information available on or before March 31, 2025.

**Key Considerations for the Forecast:**

*   **2024 Performance:** Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $53.5 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion for the full year 2024, with diluted EPS of $40.54. For Q4 2024, net revenues were $13.87 billion, net earnings were $4.11 billion, and diluted EPS was $11.95. The firm achieved an efficiency ratio of 63.1% in 2024.
*   **2025 Outlook (as of March 31, 2025):** Goldman Sachs's own outlook for 2025 anticipated continued US economic outperformance with projected growth of 2.5%, suggesting a generally favorable operating environment for financial services. The company also expected "high-single-digit annual growth in the coming years" for its Management and other fees and Private banking and lending net revenues, and consistent fundraising levels in alternatives for 2025.
*   **Shares Outstanding:** As of February 7, 2025, Goldman Sachs had 312,039,033 shares of common stock outstanding.
*   **Seasonality and Trends:** Q1 can often be a strong quarter for financial institutions due to new business initiatives and year-end activity spillover. I will project a modest sequential increase in revenue from Q4 2024, reflecting the positive, albeit potentially volatile, economic outlook.

**Forecast Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:** I project a modest increase over Q4 2024 revenue, considering the positive economic outlook for 2025 and expected growth in certain business segments. I estimate a 7% sequential increase from Q4 2024 revenue.
2.  **Operating Income:** I will apply an estimated operating margin, derived from the 2024 full-year efficiency ratio, assuming a slight improvement due to ongoing efficiency initiatives.
3.  **EBITDA:** For a financial institution, EBITDA is not a primary metric. I will estimate it by adding back a small, estimated depreciation and amortization figure (as a percentage of revenue) to Operating Income.
4.  **Net Income:** I will apply an estimated net income margin to the projected revenue, slightly above the Q4 2024 margin, reflecting a potentially stronger start to the year.
5.  **EPS:** This will be calculated by dividing the forecasted Net Income by the shares outstanding as of February 7, 2025.
6.  **Free Cash Flow:** Forecasting Free Cash Flow for a financial institution is complex due to the nature of its balance sheet and cash flow movements. Without specific guidance, I will provide a simplified estimate as a conservative percentage of Net Income.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a global healthcare company focused on Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. The forecasts for 2025_Q1 are based on the company's full-year 2024 results, 2025 guidance provided on January 22, 2025, and historical Q1 2024 performance.

**Key Assumptions and Methodology:**

1.  **Revenue:**
    *   Johnson & Johnson reported full-year 2024 revenue of $88.821 billion.
    *   The company provided full-year 2025 operational sales growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%. Using the midpoint of 3.0%, the estimated full-year 2025 revenue is $88.821 billion \* (1 + 0.03) = $91.48563 billion.
    *   Q1 2024 revenue was $21.383 billion, which represented approximately 24.07% of the full-year 2024 revenue ($21.383 billion / $88.821 billion).
    *   Assuming a similar quarterly seasonality, Q1 2025 revenue is projected as 24.07% of the estimated full-year 2025 revenue: $91.48563 billion \* 0.2407 = $22.000 billion (rounded).

2.  **Operating Income:**
    *   For Q1 2024, the adjusted income before tax as a percentage of sales was 36.8%. This is used as a proxy for operating margin.
    *   Projected Q1 2025 Operating Income = Projected Q1 2025 Revenue \* 0.368 = $22.000 billion \* 0.368 = $8.096 billion.

3.  **EBITDA:**
    *   Q1 2024 Free Cash Flow was approximately $3 billion.
    *   To estimate EBITDA, an assumption for Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is needed. Based on typical company financials, and without specific Q1 2024 D&A, we estimate full-year 2024 D&A from the 10-K (filed February 13, 2025) to be approximately $4 billion, implying Q1 2024 D&A of $1 billion.
    *   Estimated Q1 2024 EBITDA = Estimated Q1 2024 Operating Income + Estimated Q1 2024 D&A = $7.869 billion + $1.000 billion = $8.869 billion.
    *   EBITDA Margin (Q1 2024) = $8.869 billion / $21.383 billion = 41.48%.
    *   Projected Q1 2025 EBITDA = Projected Q1 2025 Revenue \* 0.4148 = $22.000 billion \* 0.4148 = $9.126 billion (rounded).

4.  **Net Income:**
    *   Q1 2024 Net Income was $5.354 billion.
    *   Net Income Margin (Q1 2024) = $5.354 billion / $21.383 billion = 25.04%.
    *   Projected Q1 2025 Net Income = Projected Q1 2025 Revenue \* 0.2504 = $22.000 billion \* 0.2504 = $5.509 billion (rounded).

5.  **Free Cash Flow:**
    *   Q1 2024 Free Cash Flow was approximately $3.000 billion.
    *   Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue (Q1 2024) = $3.000 billion / $21.383 billion = 14.03%.
    *   Projected Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow = Projected Q1 2025 Revenue \* 0.1403 = $22.000 billion \* 0.1403 = $3.087 billion (rounded).

6.  **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**
    *   Johnson & Johnson provided full-year 2025 adjusted operational EPS guidance of $10.75 to $10.95. Using the midpoint, this is $10.85.
    *   Full-year 2024 adjusted EPS was $9.98.
    *   Q1 2024 adjusted EPS was $2.71. This was 27.15% of full-year 2024 adjusted EPS ($2.71 / $9.98).
    *   Projected Q1 2025 Adjusted EPS = $10.85 \* 0.2715 = $2.94.
    *   The difference between Q1 2024 adjusted EPS ($2.71) and reported EPS ($2.20) was $0.51. Assuming a similar difference for Q1 2025, the projected reported EPS is $2.94 - $0.51 = $2.43.

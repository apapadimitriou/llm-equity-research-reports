**Calculations for Full-Year 2025 Estimates:**

1.  **Revenue:** Sum of segment revenues = $132,000,000,000 + $185,000,000,000 + $134,000,000,000 = $451,000,000,000.
2.  **Net Income:** Using the midpoint of GAAP diluted EPS guidance and shares outstanding: $4.705 * 1,269,000,000 = $5,969,745,000.
3.  **Operating Income:**
    *   First, estimate 2025 Adjusted Operating Income: $2,000,000,000 (Health Care Benefits) + $7,540,000,000 (Health Services) + $5,480,000,000 (Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness) = $15,020,000,000.
    *   To estimate GAAP Operating Income from Net Income, we use the 2024 relationship.
        *   2024 Net Income / 2024 Operating Income = $4,600,000,000 / $8,500,000,000 = 0.541176.
        *   Estimated 2025 Operating Income = Estimated 2025 Net Income / 0.541176 = $5,969,745,000 / 0.541176 = $11,031,000,000 (rounded).
4.  **EBITDA:**
    *   Assumed 2025 D&A is approximately the same as 2024 D&A: $4,600,000,000.
    *   Estimated 2025 EBITDA = Estimated 2025 Operating Income + Estimated 2025 D&A = $11,031,000,000 + $4,600,000,000 = $15,631,000,000.
5.  **Free Cash Flow:** The company provided guidance for Cash Flow from Operations of approximately $6.5 billion for 2025. We will use this as the Free Cash Flow estimate, assuming capital expenditures are implicitly accounted for in this "approximately" figure or are a relatively stable proportion.

**Calculating Q1 2025 Projections using Q1 2024 to Full-Year 2024 Ratios:**

*   **Revenue:** Q1 2024 Revenue / FY 2024 Revenue = $88,400,000,000 / $372,800,000,000 = 0.2371.
    *   Q1 2025 Revenue = $451,000,000,000 * 0.2371 = $106,952,100,000.
*   **Operating Income:** Q1 2024 Operating Income / FY 2024 Operating Income = $2,300,000,000 / $8,500,000,000 = 0.2706.
    *   Q1 2025 Operating Income = $11,031,000,000 * 0.2706 = $2,985,000,000 (rounded).
*   **Net Income:** Q1 2024 Net Income / FY 2024 Net Income = $1,100,000,000 / $4,600,000,000 = 0.2391.
    *   Q1 2025 Net Income = $5,969,745,000 * 0.2391 = $1,427,300,000 (rounded).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Q1 2024 Cash Flow from Operations / FY 2024 Cash Flow from Operations = $4,900,000,000 / $9,100,000,000 = 0.5385.
    *   Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow = $6,500,000,000 * 0.5385 = $3,500,250,000.
*   **EPS:** Q1 2024 GAAP EPS / FY 2024 GAAP EPS = $0.88 / $3.66 = 0.2404.
    *   Q1 2025 EPS = $4.705 * 0.2404 = $1.131182 (rounded to $1.13).
*   **EBITDA:**
    *   Q1 2024 D&A / FY 2024 D&A = $1,138,000,000 / $4,597,000,000 = 0.2476.
    *   Q1 2025 D&A = $4,600,000,000 * 0.2476 = $1,138,960,000.
    *   Q1 2025 EBITDA = Q1 2025 Operating Income + Q1 2025 D&A = $2,985,000,000 + $1,138,960,000 = $4,123,960,000.

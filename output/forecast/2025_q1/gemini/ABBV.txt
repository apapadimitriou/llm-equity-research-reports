**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **Revenue:** The forecast for 2025_Q1 Revenue is based on analyst consensus of $14.82 billion, which was available prior to the April 11, 2025 cutoff date.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The 2025_Q1 EPS forecast of $2.31 is derived from analyst consensus available before the cutoff date.
*   **Net Income:** Net Income is calculated by multiplying the forecasted EPS by the number of shares outstanding. As of October 28, 2024, AbbVie Inc. had 1,767,140,323 shares of common stock outstanding. Therefore, Net Income = $2.31 * 1,767,140,323 = $4,079,004,140.
*   **Operating Income:** AbbVie provided full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin guidance of approximately 44.5% of sales during its Q4 2024 earnings call on January 31, 2025. Applying this percentage to the forecasted Q1 2025 Revenue: Operating Income = $14,820,000,000 * 0.445 = $6,594,900,000.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, we add Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) to Operating Income. In the absence of specific Q1 2025 D&A guidance before the cutoff date, the D&A from Q4 2024 of $206 million is used as a proxy for Q1 2025. Therefore, EBITDA = $6,594,900,000 (Operating Income) + $206,000,000 (D&A) = $6,800,900,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** For Free Cash Flow, the full-year 2024 Free Cash Flow of $17.832 billion is used to estimate a quarterly average. In the absence of specific Q1 2025 guidance, this provides a reasonable approximation. Therefore, Free Cash Flow = $17,832,000,000 / 4 = $4,458,000,000.

Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) reported its first-quarter fiscal year 2025 results on February 26, 2025, which falls before the assumed forecast date of May 14, 2025. Therefore, the "forecast" for 2025_Q1 will reflect the actual reported figures for metrics where data is available. For metrics not explicitly reported for the quarter, estimations are made based on available full-year guidance and general financial principles.

**Key Reported Q1 2025 Results (Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2025):**
*   **Revenue:** Synopsys reported revenue of $1.455 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, exceeding the midpoint of its guidance.
*   **Operating Income:** GAAP operating income for Q1 2025 was $251.8 million.
*   **Net Income:** GAAP net income from continuing operations for Q1 2025 was $295.7 million.
*   **EPS:** GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) for Q1 2025 was $1.89. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03.

**Forecast/Estimation for Q1 2025 (where specific Q1 actuals were not explicitly provided in the snippets):**

*   **Free Cash Flow:** Synopsys reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, including expectations for free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion. Assuming a relatively even quarterly distribution, the estimated free cash flow for Q1 2025 is derived by dividing the full-year guidance by four.
    *   Estimated Q1 2025 Free Cash Flow = $1,600,000,000 / 4 = $400,000,000.

*   **EBITDA:** To calculate EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is needed in addition to Operating Income. The Q1 2025 earnings press release snippets did not explicitly provide D&A for the quarter. As a reasonable estimation for a software and IP company, D&A is assumed to be approximately 5% of revenue.
    *   Estimated Q1 2025 D&A = 5% of $1,455,000,000 = $72,750,000.
    *   Estimated Q1 2025 EBITDA = Operating Income + Estimated D&A = $251,800,000 + $72,750,000 = $324,550,000.

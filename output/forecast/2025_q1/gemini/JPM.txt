JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is a leading global financial services firm. As of March 28, 2025, the most recent financial information available for forecasting Q1 2025 includes the company's Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 financial results, released on January 15, 2025, and its 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on February 14, 2025.

For the full year 2024, JPMorgan Chase reported revenue of $173 billion and net income of $54 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $18.22. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm achieved revenue of $43.7 billion, net income of $14 billion, and EPS of $4.81. Non-interest expenses for Q4 2024 were $22.8 billion.

As of the forecast date, there was no specific quantitative guidance provided by JPMorgan Chase for Q1 2025. However, the firm's management commentary in the Q4 2024 earnings call acknowledged "uncertainties in the regulatory environment" and a focus on capital management, including potential share buybacks. Shares outstanding as of January 31, 2025, were approximately 2.8 billion.

Based on the strong performance in Q4 2024 and the general outlook, while acknowledging potential headwinds, we project a slight sequential increase in revenue for Q1 2025, reflecting continued business activity. Non-interest expenses are expected to see a modest increase due to ongoing investments and inflationary pressures. Net income is projected to remain robust, albeit with a slight moderation from the strong Q4 2024, reflecting the broader economic uncertainties.

EBITDA for a financial institution is not a standard reported metric and is estimated by adding back an assumed depreciation and amortization to operating income. Free Cash Flow for a bank is also not calculated in the traditional sense; our projection represents a simplified estimate of cash generated after considering operational activities and capital management.

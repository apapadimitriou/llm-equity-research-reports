**Reasoning for Forecasts:**

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The forecast for Q1 2025 EPS is based on the analyst consensus available as of April 9, 2025, which expected CME Group to report a non-GAAP profit of $2.64 per share. This represents a notable 5.6% increase from the $2.50 per share reported in the year-ago quarter (Q1 2024 adjusted EPS).
*   **Net Income:** To derive Net Income, the projected adjusted EPS of $2.64 is multiplied by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Based on CME Group's Q4 2024 earnings release, diluted common shares for Q4 2024 were approximately 360,050,000. Assuming a similar share count for Q1 2025, the projected Net Income is $2.64 * 360,050,000 = $950,532,000.
*   **Revenue:** CME Group reported adjusted revenue of $1.5 billion for Q1 2024. Given the analyst consensus for a 5.6% increase in EPS year-over-year for Q1 2025, and assuming a relatively consistent relationship between revenue and earnings, revenue is projected to increase by a similar percentage. Therefore, Q1 2025 Revenue is forecast as $1,500,000,000 * (1 + 0.056) = $1,584,000,000.
*   **Operating Income:** CME Group's adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 was $960 million. Applying the same 5.6% year-over-year growth rate used for EPS and Revenue, the projected Operating Income for Q1 2025 is $960,000,000 * (1 + 0.056) = $1,013,760,000.
*   **EBITDA:** To estimate EBITDA, Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is added back to Operating Income. Based on CME Group's full-year 2024 adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion and an estimated EBITDA of $4.268 billion (from a financial data source), the approximate D&A for 2024 was $368 million, or an average of $92 million per quarter. [cite: 1, 3, 4, 17 (from previous step)] Using this quarterly average D&A, the projected EBITDA for Q1 2025 is $1,013,760,000 (Operating Income) + $92,000,000 (Estimated D&A) = $1,105,760,000.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Free Cash Flow is estimated by taking Operating Cash Flow and subtracting Capital Expenditures. For Q4 2024, cash flow from continuing operating activities was $968.1 million, while adjusted net income was $919 million, indicating that operating cash flow was approximately 105.34% of adjusted net income. Applying this ratio to the projected Q1 2025 Net Income: $950,532,000 * 1.0534 = $1,001,894,000 (Operating Cash Flow). For Capital Expenditures, CME Group provided full-year 2025 guidance of approximately $90 million. Assuming an even quarterly distribution, Q1 2025 Capital Expenditures are estimated at $90,000,000 / 4 = $22,500,000. Therefore, projected Free Cash Flow is $1,001,894,000 - $22,500,000 = $979,394,000.

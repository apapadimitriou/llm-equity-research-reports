The following forecast for Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) for 2025_Q1 is based on the company's guidance provided during its Q4 2024 earnings call on February 21, 2024, and historical financial data available on or before May 14, 2024.

**Key Assumptions and Derivations:**

*   **Revenue:** Nvidia guided for Q1 2025 revenue to be $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The midpoint of $24.0 billion is used for this forecast.
*   **Gross Margin:** GAAP gross margin is expected to be 76.3%, plus or minus 50 basis points. The midpoint of 76.3% is used.
*   **Operating Expenses:** GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion.
*   **Other Income and Expense:** GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million.
*   **Tax Rate:** GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17.0%, plus or minus 1%. The midpoint of 17.0% is used.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** Based on the Q3 fiscal year 2024 CFO commentary, depreciation and amortization expense was $372 million. This quarterly figure is used as an estimate for Q1 2025.
*   **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** For fiscal year 2024, total capital expenditures were $1,069 million. Q1 2025 CapEx is estimated as one-fourth of this annual figure, assuming an even spread throughout the year.
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended October 29, 2023 (Q3 FY24), were 2,494 million. This figure is used as an estimate for Q1 2025, assuming relative stability.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Calculated as Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures. This is a simplified approach due to the absence of specific Q1 2025 cash flow from operations guidance.

**Calculations:**

*   **Cost of Revenue** = Revenue * (1 - Gross Margin) = $24,000,000,000 * (1 - 0.763) = $5,688,000,000
*   **Operating Income** = Revenue - Cost of Revenue - Operating Expenses = $24,000,000,000 - $5,688,000,000 - $3,500,000,000 = $14,812,000,000
*   **EBITDA** = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization = $14,812,000,000 + $372,000,000 = $15,184,000,000
*   **Pre-tax Income** = Operating Income + Other Income and Expense = $14,812,000,000 + $250,000,000 = $15,062,000,000
*   **Tax Expense** = Pre-tax Income * Tax Rate = $15,062,000,000 * 0.17 = $2,560,540,000
*   **Net Income** = Pre-tax Income - Tax Expense = $15,062,000,000 - $2,560,540,000 = $12,501,460,000
*   **EPS** = Net Income / Diluted Shares Outstanding = $12,501,460,000 / 2,494,000,000 = $5.01
*   **Free Cash Flow** = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures = $12,501,460,000 + $372,000,000 - $267,250,000 = $12,606,210,000

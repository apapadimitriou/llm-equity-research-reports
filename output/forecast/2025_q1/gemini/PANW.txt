**Forecast for 2025_Q1 (Palo Alto Networks' Fiscal Q3 2025):**

1.  **Revenue:**
    *   Total FY2025 Revenue (midpoint guidance): $9,165,000,000
    *   Actual Q1 FY2025 Revenue: $2,140,000,000
    *   Actual Q2 FY2025 Revenue: $2,260,000,000
    *   Remaining Revenue for Q3 + Q4 FY2025: $9,165,000,000 - $2,140,000,000 - $2,260,000,000 = $4,765,000,000.
    *   Assuming Q3 revenue grows approximately 5% sequentially from Q2: $2,260,000,000 * 1.05 = **$2,373,000,000**.

2.  **Operating Income (GAAP):**
    *   Full FY2025 Non-GAAP Operating Margin midpoint: 27.75%.
    *   Estimated Non-GAAP Operating Income for Q3: $2,373,000,000 * 0.2775 = $658,447,500.
    *   To estimate GAAP Operating Income, we consider the historical difference between GAAP and Non-GAAP operating income, which is primarily due to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. Based on historical trends and the difference between GAAP and Non-GAAP net income, we estimate non-GAAP adjustments for operating income to be approximately $295,000,000.
    *   GAAP Operating Income = $658,447,500 - $295,000,000 = **$363,448,000** (rounded).

3.  **Net Income (GAAP):**
    *   Full FY2025 Non-GAAP Net Income (midpoint): $3.21 (EPS) * 704,000,000 (shares) = $2,260,640,000.
    *   Q1 FY2025 Non-GAAP Net Income (post-split): $544,900,000 / 2 = $272,450,000.
    *   Q2 FY2025 Non-GAAP Net Income (post-split): $0.81 * 704,000,000 = $570,240,000.
    *   Remaining Non-GAAP Net Income for Q3 + Q4: $2,260,640,000 - $272,450,000 - $570,240,000 = $1,417,950,000.
    *   Assuming Q3 Non-GAAP Net Income is slightly higher than Q2: $650,000,000.
    *   The difference between Q1 FY2025 Non-GAAP Net Income ($544.9M) and GAAP Net Income ($350.7M) was $194.2M. Applying a similar difference for Q3:
    *   GAAP Net Income = $650,000,000 - $194,200,000 = **$455,800,000**.

4.  **Free Cash Flow (Adjusted):**
    *   Full FY2025 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin midpoint: 37.5%.
    *   Free Cash Flow = $2,373,000,000 (Revenue) * 0.375 = **$890,000,000**.

5.  **EPS (Non-GAAP Diluted):**
    *   Using estimated Non-GAAP Net Income for Q3: $650,000,000.
    *   Estimated diluted shares outstanding (post-split): 704,000,000.
    *   EPS = $650,000,000 / 704,000,000 = **$0.92** (rounded).

6.  **EBITDA:**
    *   EBITDA = GAAP Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization.
    *   Estimated GAAP Operating Income: $363,447,500.
    *   Assuming Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is approximately 7% of revenue (a general estimate for tech companies without specific guidance in snippets): $2,373,000,000 * 0.07 = $166,110,000.
    *   EBITDA = $363,447,500 + $166,110,000 = **$529,558,000** (rounded).

Based on Citigroup’s recent results (e.g. Q1’24 net revenue ~$21,104M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100124000051/c-20240331.htm#:~:text=Total%20non,)) and Q4’24 ~$19,580M ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/15/citigroup-c-earnings-q4-2024.html#:~:text=,49%20billion%20expected))) and current trends, we project roughly flat to slightly lower revenue in 2025-Q1 (~$21.0B).  Operating income (pre-tax) in Q1’24 was $4,544M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100124000051/c-20240331.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20continuing%20operations%20before,1%2C531)); we forecast around $4,300M for Q1’25.  Provisions and expenses are assumed roughly in line with last year’s quarter.  Net income Q1’24 was $3,371M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100124000051/c-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20before%20attribution%20to,4%2C606)); we project about $3,150M for Q1’25.  With ~1.884B shares outstanding ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100125000067/c-20241231.htm#:~:text=Number%20of%20shares%20of%20Citigroup,on%20January%2031%2C%202025%3A%201%2C884%2C479%2C551)), this implies EPS ≈ $1.67.  Q1’24 operating cash flow was –$10,831M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100124000051/c-20240331.htm#:~:text=Other%2C%20net%20%20,%2830%2C485%29)) and capex $1,607M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000083100124000051/c-20240331.htm#:~:text=Proceeds%20from%20maturities%20of%20investments,%281%2C634%29)), so FCF was about –$12.4B.  We forecast similarly negative FCF (~–$11.3B) in Q1’25.  These are our original estimates based on publicly reported data and trends.

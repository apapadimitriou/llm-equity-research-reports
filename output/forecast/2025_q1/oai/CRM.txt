Salesforce’s 2025 Q1 (fiscal Q1 FY26 ended April 2025) forecast is based on recent trends and the company’s guidance.  In FY25, Salesforce delivered roughly 9–11% revenue growth each quarter – e.g. Q1 FY25 was $9.13B (+11% Y/Y) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Salesforce-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)), Q2 was $9.33B (+8%) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/fy25-q2-earnings/#:~:text=,Y%2FY%20in%20CC)), Q3 was $9.44B (+8%) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/12/03/salesforce-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-2025-results/#:~:text=,both%20Y%2FY%20%26%20in%20CC)), and Q4 was $10.0B (+8%) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=FY25%20Results)).  For FY26 Salesforce guided to $40.5–40.9B revenue (≈7–8% Y/Y) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=Full%20Year%20FY26%20Guidance)).  This implies roughly 8% growth in Q1 FY26 versus Q1 FY25.  Thus we forecast Q1 2025 (FY26 Q1) revenue around **$9.86B**.  

We assume Salesforce sustains its operating margins.  In Q1 FY25 GAAP operating income was $1.709B on $9.13B revenue (≈18.7% margin) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Salesforce-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,Y%2FY)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852424000007/crm-q1fy25xexhibit991.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,199)).  Assuming a similar ~19% margin, Q1 FY26 operating income is projected at about **$1.862B**.  EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation/amortization) is estimated by adding roughly $0.9B of D&A (similar to recent quarters), yielding approx. **$2.76B**.  We estimate net income by applying a normal tax rate; Q1 FY25 net was $1.533B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852424000007/crm-q1fy25xexhibit991.htm#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,199)) (≈16.8% of revenue).  Conservatively we assume ~16.7% net margin on $9.86B revenue, giving net income ≈ **$1.65B** (EPS ≈ $1.68, based on ~$985M diluted shares).  

Free cash flow (FCF) is more volatile quarter-to-quarter.  In Q1 FY25, FCF was about $6.08B ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Salesforce-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=10,4%20Billion%20in)) (an unusually large cash inflow, partly timing-related).  With slower growth and fewer one-offs expected, we assume Q1 FY26 FCF grows moderately.  Conservatively, ~10–15% above $6.08B yields **$6.70B**.  The Table below summarizes our projections for Salesforce Q1 FY26 (2025-Q1):

| Company        | Year | Quarter |    Revenue    |    EBITDA    | Operating Income |  Net Income  | Free Cash Flow |  EPS  |
|:--------------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Salesforce Inc | 2025 |    1    | 9,860,000,000 | 2,760,000,000|   1,862,000,000  | 1,650,000,000 | 6,700,000,000  |  1.68 |

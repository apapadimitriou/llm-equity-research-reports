Labcorp’s Q1 FY2024 continuing‐operations results set a baseline of about **$3.18B** revenue, **$321M** operating income, **$228M** net income, **–$164M** free cash flow, and **$2.69** EPS ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-first-quarter-results#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,19%20Testing)) ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-first-quarter-results#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20from%20continuing%20operations,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023)).  Using Labcorp’s 2025 guidance (≈7.4% full‐year revenue growth ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results#:~:text=%2A%20Full,2))) and recent trends (solid organic growth and acquisitions like BioReference/Invitae closed in 2024), we project roughly **+7%** revenue growth in Q1 2025.  This implies ~**$3.40B** Q1 ’25 revenue.  We assume operating margins of around **9%** (slightly below Q1 ’24’s 10.1% due to post‐deal integration costs), giving **~$306M** operating income.  Adding back depreciation/amortization (we estimate ~**$160M**, up modestly from ~$155M in Q1 ’24 ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-first-quarter-results#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,2.2))) yields **EBITDA ≈$466M**.  After interest and taxes, net income is projected around **$243M** (EPS ≈$2.87 on ≈85M shares, up from $2.69 last year ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-first-quarter-results#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20from%20continuing%20operations,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023))).  We expect Q1 free cash flow to remain slightly negative (we forecast about **–$100M**) as working‐capital and capex investments offset operating cash flow (Q1 ’24 was –$164M ([ir.labcorp.com](https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-announces-2024-first-quarter-results#:~:text=%2429,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023)), so some improvement is assumed).

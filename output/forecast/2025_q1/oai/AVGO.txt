Based on Broadcom’s own guidance and recent results, we forecast Q1 FY2025 metrics as follows.  Management guided Q1 FY2025 revenue at **≈$14.6 billion** (~22% Y/Y growth) with ~66% EBITDA margin ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results-and-quarterly-dividend-302330736.html#:~:text=,66%20percent%20of%20projected%20revenue)).  Applying these we project **Revenue ≈$14,600M**, **EBITDA ≈$9,636M**.  Historically Broadcom’s GAAP operating margin has been in the mid-30% range (e.g. Q4 FY2024 had ~$4.63B GAAP operating income on $14.05B revenue ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=,quarter%2C%20or%2065%20percent%20of)), ~33%).  We assume a similar or slightly higher margin, giving **Operating Income ≈$5,200M**.  After interest and taxes, we estimate GAAP **Net Income ≈$3,600M**.  Free cash flow has run roughly ~39–40% of revenue (Q4 FY2024 FCF was $5,482M on $14.05B rev ([investors.broadcom.com](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=%241,or%2039%20percent%20of%20revenue))≈39%), so we project **Free Cash Flow ≈$5,700M**.  Finally, GAAP EPS (diluted) = Net Income / shares.  Using ~4.8B shares (post-10-for-1 split), $3,600M net yields **EPS ≈$0.75**.   All figures in table below (in full dollars):

| Company       | Year | Quarter |        Revenue |      EBITDA | Operating Income |  Net Income | Free Cash Flow |  EPS  |

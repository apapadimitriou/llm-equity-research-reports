Across 2024 CVS showed steady topline growth (Q1’24: $88.4B, +3.7% YoY ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,9%20billion)); Q2’24: $91.2B, +2.6% ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-SECOND-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,0%20billion)); Q4’24: $97.7B, +4.2% ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2024-RESULTS/default.aspx#:~:text=,19))).  Management’s guidance for 2025 is one of strong performance ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2025/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2024-RESULTS/default.aspx#:~:text=CEO%20Commentary%20,improving%20outcomes%20and%20reducing%20costs)), and with Medicare Advantage trends improving (better star ratings, lower loss reserves), we project continued mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q1’25.  We forecast Q1’25 revenue of roughly $94.6B.  Operating income is assumed to increase above last year’s $2.271B (Q1’24) ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,9%20billion)), to about $3.10B, reflecting modest margin recovery.  Depreciation & amortization in Q1’24 was ~$1.14B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480324000016/cvs-20240331.htm#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20%20,effects%20from%20acquisitions%3A)); assuming similar D&A, our EBITDA forecast is ≈$4.25B.  Net income in Q1’25 is projected around $1.50B (vs $1.124B in Q1’24 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480324000016/cvs-20240331.htm#:~:text=Income%20before%20income%20tax%20provision,2%2C142))), given higher revenue and controlled expense growth.  Free cash flow is extrapolated from Q1’24’s ~$4.9B cash from ops ([investors.cvshealth.com](https://investors.cvshealth.com/investors/newsroom/press-release-details/2024/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS-AND-REVISES-FULL-YEAR-2024-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=,9%20billion)) less ~$0.705B capex ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480324000016/cvs-20240331.htm#:~:text=Purchases%20of%20property%20and%20equipment,31)) (~$4.2B FCF); for Q1’25 we assume ~$5.2B cash from ops and ~$0.8B capex, yielding ~ $4.4B FCF.  Finally, with ~1.26B diluted shares, this implies EPS ≈ $1.19.  (All amounts are in dollars, as full numbers.)

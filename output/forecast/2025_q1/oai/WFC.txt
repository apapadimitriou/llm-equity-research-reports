Using Wells Fargo’s actual Q1 2024 results as the starting point – Wells Fargo reported total revenue of $20,863 million and net income of $4,619 million in Q1 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/72971/000007297124000129/wfc-20240331.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20%20,34)) – and incorporating management’s guidance (e.g. expecting 2025 net interest income ~1–3% above 2024 levels ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/15/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q4-2024.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,7%20billion))) and recent trends (expense discipline and fee growth), we project modest revenue growth into Q1 2025.  Our forecast assumes slightly higher net interest income (on a larger deposit base and easing funding costs) and continued fee growth, partly offset by higher credit provisions.  The table below shows our Q1 2025 forecasts, with EPS derived from the projected net income and share count.  

| **Company**    | **Year** | **Quarter** | **Revenue**  | **EBITDA**   | **Operating Income** | **Net Income** | **Free Cash Flow** | **EPS** |
|---------------|---------|------------|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Wells Fargo (WFC) | 2025    | 1          | 21,000,000,000  | 7,850,000,000   | 5,950,000,000       | 4,760,000,000 | -8,000,000,000 | 1.44  |

**Notes:**  Revenue forecast (~$21,000 million) reflects a slight rise over Q1 2024’s $20,863 million ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/72971/000007297124000129/wfc-20240331.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20%20,34)) based on guidance for higher interest income in 2025 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/15/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q4-2024.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,7%20billion)). “EBITDA” here is taken as operating income plus well‐controlled depreciation; “Operating Income” is pretax profit (revenue minus operating expenses and credit provisions); and FCF is roughly operating cash flow minus minimal capital spending (strong retail deposit growth drives negative FCF). The EPS is net income divided by an estimated ~3,300 million diluted shares.

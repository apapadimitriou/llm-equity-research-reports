**Analysis:** Amazon’s Q1 trends and guidance support moderate revenue growth. In Q1 2024 Amazon earned $143.3B in net sales (13% YoY gain) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx?gsid=467faec2-9705-4ee4-a1a5-060f4794df49#:~:text=%2A%20Net%20sales%20increased%2013,compared%20with%20first%20quarter%202023)), driven by strong AWS (+17%) and advertising. For Q1 2025 management guided $151–155.5B ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/bac8e33542ee7eae02dddd68a33bf189#:~:text=Amazon%20reported%20strong%20revenue%20and,5%20billion%2C%20citing%20unfavorable%20foreign)); we take the midpoint (~$153B) as our revenue forecast.  This implies ~6–7% YOY growth, reflecting continued cloud/ads strength offset by consumer caution (as noted in Q2 2024 commentary) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-projects-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-2024-08-01/#:~:text=Amazon%20reported%20slower%20online%20sales,revenue%20increase%2C%20surpassing%20expectations)).  

Operating income in Q1 2024 was $15.3B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx?gsid=467faec2-9705-4ee4-a1a5-060f4794df49#:~:text=,billion%20in%20first%20quarter%202023)) (≈10.7% margin on $143.3B). With AWS and efficiency gains, we assume a similar-to-slightly higher margin (~10.8%), yielding ~ $16.5B Op. Inc on $153B sales.  Depreciation & amortization was $11.68B in Q1 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872424000083/amzn-20240331.htm#:~:text=Depreciation%20and%20amortization%20of%20property,)); assuming ~5% growth we use ≈$12.3B D&A.  Hence, **EBITDA** ≈ Op. Inc + D&A ≃ $16.5B + $12.3B ≈ **$28.8B**.  

Net income in Q1 2024 was $10.43B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx?gsid=467faec2-9705-4ee4-a1a5-060f4794df49#:~:text=,tax%20valuation%20loss%20of%20%242.0)) ($0.98 EPS).  Our higher revenue and operating profit lead us to ~$12.0B net income for Q1 2025.  This reflects taxes and non-operating items roughly in line with historical rates.  With diluted shares near ~10.9B (vs 10.67B in Q1 2024 ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx?gsid=467faec2-9705-4ee4-a1a5-060f4794df49#:~:text=Weighted,AMAZON.COM%2C%20INC))), the implied **EPS** is about $1.11.  

Free cash flow will remain very strong. Trailing‐12M FCF was $50.1B as of Q1 2024 ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results-68b9258cd/default.aspx?gsid=467faec2-9705-4ee4-a1a5-060f4794df49#:~:text=,of%20finance%20leases%20and%20financing)), reflecting robust cash generation.  For Q1 alone, with operating cashflow rising alongside net income and capex similar to past levels, we forecast **~$6.0B** FCF.  

These assumptions yield the following Q1 2025 projections:

| Company         | Year | Quarter |   **Revenue**   |   **EBITDA**   | **Operating Income** | **Net Income** | **Free Cash Flow** |  **EPS** |
|-----------------|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------|

Based on Johnson & Johnson’s recent results and 2025 guidance, we project modest growth in Q1 2025.  J&J’s Q1 2024 sales were \$21,383 M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Sales%20to%20customers%20,68.0)), and the company is guiding for ~2.5–3.5% operational sales growth in 2025 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,point)).  Recent quarters grew mid-single-digit (Q2 ’24 sales +4.3%, Q3 ’24 +5.2%) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=,5.9)) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q3-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Reported%20Sales%20%20,34.3)), so roughly 2–3% growth for Q1 is reasonable.  Together with stable margins, we forecast Q1 2025 revenue ≈\$22.0B.  Operating income (EBIT) was roughly \$5.9B in Q1 2024 (about 27.6% of sales) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Sales%20to%20customers%20,49)); assuming a similar margin and higher sales, we project EBIT ≈\$6.1B.  Adding back depreciation (≈\$1.8B) gives EBITDA ~\$8.2B.  Q1 2024 net earnings (continuing ops) were \$3.255B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20,)) on \$21.383B sales (≈15.2% net margin).  With slightly higher sales and normal tax rates, we estimate net ≈\$3.35B and EPS ≈\$1.37 (assuming ~2.43B diluted shares).  Free cash flow (OCF minus CapEx) in Q1 2024 was about \$2.85B (OCF \$3.657B less \$0.807B capex ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20cash%20flows%20from%20operating,))); we assume similar conversion and project ≈\$2.9B.  All values are rounded to the nearest hundred million for presentation:

| Company            | Year | Quarter | Revenue        | EBITDA         | Operating Income | Net Income      | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|--------------------|------|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| Johnson & Johnson  | 2025 | 1       | 22,000,000,000 | 8,200,000,000  | 6,100,000,000    | 3,350,000,000   | 2,900,000,000  | 1.37 |

**Justification:** We anchor on Q1 2024 results (e.g. \$21.383B revenue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Sales%20to%20customers%20,68.0)), \$3.255B net ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20,))) and factor in ~2–3% reported growth (guided ~3% operational ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,point))) plus steady margins. For cash flow, JNJ’s filings show Q1’24 OCF \$3.657B and capex \$0.807B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000049/jnj-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20cash%20flows%20from%20operating,)), implying ~\$2.85B FCF; with higher sales we round to ~\$2.9B for Q1’25. All forecasts reflect JNJ’s public guidance and historical performance (Q2/Q3’24 sales growth ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-reports-Q2-2024-results/default.aspx#:~:text=,5.9)) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q3-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Reported%20Sales%20%20,34.3))) and assume no dramatic one‐off items.

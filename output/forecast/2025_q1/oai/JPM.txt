As of Q1 2024 JPMorgan’s “total net revenue” was $41.934 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000326/jpm-20240331.htm#:~:text=Noninterest%20revenue%20%20,)) with net income $13.419 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000326/jpm-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,1%2C649)).  By Q4 2024, revenue had risen to $42.768 billion ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-JPMC-Co-Form-8-K-4Q2024-earnings-release-15-January-2025-48766280/#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20,10)) and net income to $14.005 billion ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/JPMorgan-Chase-JPMC-Co-Form-8-K-4Q2024-earnings-release-15-January-2025-48766280/#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20,9)).  Management has guided 2025 net interest income to ~$94 billion ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-profit-jumps-dealmakers-traders-ride-market-rebound-2025-01-15/#:~:text=conditions,up%20from%20the%20previous%20year)) (implying Q1 NII ~flat-to-up vs Q1 2024’s $23.1 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000326/jpm-20240331.htm#:~:text=Noninterest%20revenue%20%20,))), and continued strength in investment banking and trading fees.  We therefore project Q1 2025 total revenue of about **$44.0 billion** (roughly +5% YoY).  Non-interest expenses (compensation, technology etc.) should rise modestly, and provisions remain near ~$1.5 billion.  This yields pre-tax “operating income” of roughly **$19.0 billion**.  At ~22% tax, net income is around **$14.82 billion**.  With ~2.88 billion diluted shares ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000611/jpm-20240930.htm#:~:text=Weighted,2%2C951.0)), EPS is about **$5.05**.  We compute free cash flow as net income plus depreciation (~$2.1 billion, similar to Q1 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961724000326/jpm-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,1%2C649))), or roughly **$16.9 billion**.  The table below summarizes these forecasts:

| Company                | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |

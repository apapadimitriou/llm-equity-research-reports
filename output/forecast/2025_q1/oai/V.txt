# Visa (V) Q1 2025 Forecast

Visa’s recent results show continued double‐digit revenue growth. For fiscal Q1 2025 (ended Dec 2024), Visa reported net revenue of $9.51B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000017/v-20241231.htm#:~:text=,)), up 10.1% year-over-year, and GAAP EPS of $2.58 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000017/v-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,3.80)). Management has guided FY2025 net revenue growth in the “high single digits to low double digits” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-profit-rises-resilient-consumer-spending-2024-10-29/#:~:text=the%20Asia,increase)), implying roughly ~8–10% annual growth.  Assuming similar growth and stable operating margins, we project Q1 2025 (calendar Jan–Mar) net revenue around **$9.40B**.  Historical operating margins (~65%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000017/v-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,3.80)) suggest operating income ≈**$6.20B**.  After interest and taxes, net income is forecast roughly **$5.00B** (given past net income of $5.12B last quarter ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000017/v-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,3.80))).  We estimate EBITDA ≈**$6.50B** and free cash flow ≈**$5.10B** (assuming cash from operations ~ $5.5B and capex ~$0.4B).  Our EPS forecast of **$2.60** assumes continued share buybacks and modest share count. These values are summarized below:

| Company | Year | Quarter | **Revenue**       | **EBITDA**        | **Operating Income** | **Net Income**    | **Free Cash Flow** | **EPS** |
|---------|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------|

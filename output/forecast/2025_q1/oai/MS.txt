Based on Morgan Stanley’s recent results and market outlook, we expect Q1 2025 results to be broadly in line with the strong performance seen in late 2024.  Morgan Stanley reported Q1 2024 net revenues of $15.136B and net income $3.412B ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240415825770/en/Morgan-Stanley-First-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Results#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,)), rising to $16.223B revenue and $3.714B net profit in Q4 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542125000079/a4q24msearningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Firm%20,%249%2C087)).  Management commentary and industry analyses suggest 2025 will bring renewed capital‐markets strength (e.g. firmer M&A and trading activity) ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/capital-markets-outlook-2025#:~:text=,AI%20and%20other%20related%20infrastructure)) ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/capital-markets-outlook-2025#:~:text=Capital%20markets%20are%20emerging%20from,a%20lot%20more%20activity%20for)).  We therefore project Q1 2025 net revenues roughly ~$15.8B.  Assuming similar expense and tax rates, that yields operating (pre-tax) income ≈$4.35B and net income ≈$3.30B.  From Q1 2024 data, depreciation was about $0.975B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542124000322/ms-20240331.htm#:~:text=Stock,234)) and interest expense was large (~$11.1B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542124000322/ms-20240331.htm#:~:text=Interest%20expense%20%20,1%2C218))), so we estimate EBITDA (op. income + interest + D&A) ≈$16.9B.  For free cash flow (defined as cash from operations minus capex), note that Q1 2024 had operating cash flow $4.36B and capex $0.816B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542124000322/ms-20240331.htm#:~:text=Customer%20and%20other%20receivables%20and,)), leaving ~3.54B FCF.  With similar capex and slightly lower operating cash (assuming some normalization), we forecast ~2.95B FCF.  Using ~1.63 B diluted shares yields EPS ≈$2.00.  These forecasts are summarized below:

| Company        | Year | Quarter | Revenue       | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow | EPS   |
|----------------|------|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Morgan Stanley | 2025 | 1       | 15,800,000,000 | 16,900,000,000 | 4,350,000,000    | 3,300,000,000 | 2,950,000,000  | 2.00  |

**Analysis:** Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is now its main revenue driver, but demand has fallen sharply post-pandemic.  In Q1 2024, Moderna reported just $167 million in total revenue (versus $1.9 billion in Q1 2023) with a GAAP net loss of $1.2 billion ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8MlrigQiXugsJRRw5yLU5k9wPee9dRn0cHel3Z5w-BDSQx9HQ2gukBrrA0nyfhOJAKjf3E#:~:text=Reports%20first%20quarter%20revenues%20of,07)).  That quarter’s cost of sales was $96 million (≈58% of sales) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8MlrigQiXugsJRRw5yLU5k9wPee9dRn0cHel3Z5w-BDSQx9HQ2gukBrrA0nyfhOJAKjf3E#:~:text=Cost%20of%20Sales%3A%20Cost%20of,2024%20decreased%20by%20%24696%20million)), while R&D and SG&A expenditures were roughly $1.06 billion and $0.27 billion, respectively ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8MlrigQiXugsJRRw5yLU5k9wPee9dRn0cHel3Z5w-BDSQx9HQ2gukBrrA0nyfhOJAKjf3E#:~:text=Cost%20of%20sales%20%20,2%2C228)).  Free cash flow was deeply negative (≈–$1.18 billion) due to heavy R&D investment and capital spending ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8MlrigQiXugsJRRw5yLU5k9wPee9dRn0cHel3Z5w-BDSQx9HQ2gukBrrA0nyfhOJAKjf3E#:~:text=Other%20liabilities%20%20,1%2C957)).  

For 2025 Moderna has dramatically lowered its sales outlook (to $1.5–$2.5 billion) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Expects%202025%20revenue%20range%20of,balance%20of%20approximately%20%246%20billion)), expecting most revenue to come in the back half of the year.  Given this, and the seasonal trough in vaccine demand in Q1, we forecast **Q1 2025 revenue of about $100 million** (down ~40% from Q1’24).  We assume modest gross margins (COGS ~60% of sales) and continued aggressive cost cuts.  For example, if Q1 R&D spending drops slightly from $1.1 billion to ~$1.0 billion and SG&A falls to ~$0.2 billion, operating expenses remain very large.  Our model yields an operating loss on the order of –$1.2 billion and a GAAP net loss of roughly –$1.2 billion (EPS ≈–$3.16), reflecting persistent R&D and legacy manufacturing costs.  EBITDA (operating loss plus depreciation) is roughly –$1.16 billion.  We assume Q1 capex of order $0.15 billion, so free cash flow is also about –$1.2 billion.  The table below summarizes these Q1’25 projections.  (All figures in USD, in absolute dollars.)  

| Company  | Year | Quarter |   Revenue    |   EBITDA      | Operating Income |  Net Income    | Free Cash Flow |   EPS   |
|:---------|:----:|:-------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-------:|
| Moderna  | 2025 |    1    | 100,000,000  | –1,160,000,000 | –1,200,000,000  | –1,200,000,000 | –1,200,000,000 | –3.16   |

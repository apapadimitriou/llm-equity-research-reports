BlackRock’s results were very strong in late 2024.  For example, Q1 2024 revenue was $4,728 million (versus $4,243 m a year earlier) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024054148/blk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Investment%20advisory%20performance%20fees%20,)), and FY 2024 revenue was $20,407 m (up 14% YoY) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=14,fees%20and%20technology%20service%20revenue)).  We assume this momentum carries into Q1 2025.  In particular, with sustained ETF and private‐markets inflows and positive markets, a ~10–12% revenue increase is reasonable.  Thus, we forecast Q1 2025 revenue ≈ $5,300 m.  With operating margins still in the mid-30% range (Q1 2024 op margin was 35.8% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024054148/blk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Sub,))), this implies operating income ~ $1,900 m.  Adding back depreciation/amortization (~$50–100 m) gives EBITDA on the order of $2,000 m.  Non‐GAAP items and taxes lead us to a net income around $1,500 m, implying diluted EPS ~ $10.00 (using ~150 m shares).  Finally, Q1 cash flow is typically negative; in Q1 2024 net cash from operations was –$408 m ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024054148/blk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Investments%2C%20trading%20%20,)), so we forecast FCF ≈ –$500 m.  These forecasts are based on the cited historical results and described trends ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=14,fees%20and%20technology%20service%20revenue)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024054148/blk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Investment%20advisory%20performance%20fees%20,)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000095017024054148/blk-20240331.htm#:~:text=Investments%2C%20trading%20%20,)).

The key inputs for our forecast are the Q1 2024 actuals and management’s 2025 guidance.  Q1 2024 revenue was ~$15.801B with net income ~$2.437B (EPS $3.33) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-First-Quarter-Revenue-Increased-11-to-15.8-Billion-and-EPS-Increased-39-to-3.33-Reflecting-Continued-Business-Momentum/default.aspx?trk=public_post_comment-text#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20Net%20of%20Interest,39)).  Management expects full-year 2025 revenue +8–10% ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202025%2C,stock%20dividend%20by%2017%20percent)).  We assume Q1 2025 revenue grows ~7% year-over-year to ~$16.90B.  Assuming provision and expense levels similar to last year (implying pretax income ~3.26B), and applying a ~21–22% tax rate yields net income ≈$2.57B.  Adding back ~$0.4B of depreciation gives EBITDA ≈$6.06B (plus interest as needed).  Free cash flow is estimated from operating cash (~$6.0B) minus capex (~$0.4B) ≈$5.6B.  With ~714M diluted shares, EPS ≈$3.60.

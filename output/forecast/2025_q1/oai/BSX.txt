# Boston Scientific – Q1 2025 Forecast

Boston Scientific’s management has guided for strong growth in Q1 2025.  Specifically, the earnings release projects net sales up about 17–19% versus Q1 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000007/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Reported%20growth%20%20,)).  Since Q1 2024 net sales were $3.856 billion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572524000040/q12024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Marlborough%2C%20Mass.%20%28April%C2%A024%2C%202024%29%20,47%20a%20year%20ago)), an 18% increase implies roughly $4.55 billion in Q1 2025 revenue.  Using the midpoint of guidance (≈18%), we forecast **Revenue ≈ $4.55 billion (4,550,000,000)** for 2025-Q1.  

Management also guided GAAP EPS of $0.43–$0.45 for Q1 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000007/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=,0.55)).  Taking $0.44 per share and ~1.49 billion diluted shares yields net income around $655 million.  We assume interest expense and tax rates similar to Q1 2024 (yielding an effective tax ~25–28%), which implies **Operating Income ≈ $820 million** and **Net Income ≈ $655 million** for 2025-Q1.  We add back depreciation and amortization (roughly $300M, based on recent trends) to estimate **EBITDA ≈ $1,150 million**.  For free cash flow, using recent cash-flow trends (Q1 2024 had ~$164M cash from ops and ~$179M CAPEX) and slightly higher earnings, we project **Free Cash Flow ≈ $60 million** (i.e. modest positive FCF).  The resulting EPS is **$0.44**. 

All projections are summarized below:

| Company            | Year | Quarter | Revenue      | EBITDA       | Operating Income | Net Income   | Free Cash Flow |   EPS  |
|--------------------|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Boston Scientific  | 2025 | 1       | 4,550,000,000  | 1,150,000,000  | 820,000,000     | 655,000,000  | 60,000,000     | 0.44   |

**Assumptions & Sources:** Guidance from the Feb 2025 earnings release was used ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000007/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Reported%20growth%20%20,)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000007/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=,0.55)).  Prior-year Q1 results are from the 2024 Q1 10-Q ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572524000040/q12024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Marlborough%2C%20Mass.%20%28April%C2%A024%2C%202024%29%20,47%20a%20year%20ago)).  Margins and cashflow are extrapolated from recent patterns and adjusted for 2025 expectations.

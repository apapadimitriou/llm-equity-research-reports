Bank of America’s Q1 2024 results provide a baseline: revenue of $25.818 B, pre‐tax (operating) income $7.262 B and net income $6.674 B ([investor.bankofamerica.com](https://investor.bankofamerica.com/regulatory-and-other-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000070858-24-000144/bac03312024ex991.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%2C%20net%20of%20interest,2%20Diluted%20earnings%20per)).  Going into 2025, the bank expects continued strength in lending: management projects roughly 6–7% growth in net interest income for 2025 ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bank-of-america-forecasts-record-net-interest-income-in-2025-3862712#:~:text=Investing.com%20,significant%20role%20in%20this%20increase)).  Assuming modest increases in loan/deposit volumes and stable non‐interest income, we forecast Q1 2025 total revenue at about $26.0 B.  We estimate noninterest expense roughly flat at ~$17.0 B and credit-provision expense around $1.3 B, yielding pre-tax operating income ≈$7.7 B.  At an effective tax rate near 24–25%, this implies net income ≈$5.85 B (≈$0.72 per share, using an ~8.1B share count).  Free cash flow (CFO minus capex) is projected to be modestly negative; Q1 2024 had a large operating outflow (–$15.5 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000007085824000156/bac-20240331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L4662%20Net%20cash,))), and while Q1 2025 should see much smaller inflows, we estimate FCF around –$3.0 B.  

Putting this together, our Q1 2025 forecasts are shown below (figures in dollars, EPS in dollars per share): 

| Company         | Year | Quarter | Revenue         | EBITDA          | Operating Income | Net Income    | Free Cash Flow  | EPS   |
|-----------------|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Bank of America | 2025 | 1       | 26,000,000,000  | 30,250,000,000  | 7,700,000,000    | 5,852,000,000 | -3,000,000,000  | 0.72  |

**Assumptions and support:**  We use Q1 2024’s reported results ([investor.bankofamerica.com](https://investor.bankofamerica.com/regulatory-and-other-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000070858-24-000144/bac03312024ex991.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%2C%20net%20of%20interest,2%20Diluted%20earnings%20per)) as a baseline.  The modest revenue gain reflects continued high rates (supporting net interest income growth) and resilient consumer activity ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bank-of-america-forecasts-record-net-interest-income-in-2025-3862712#:~:text=Investing.com%20,significant%20role%20in%20this%20increase)).  Operating expense and loss provisions are assumed roughly flat year-over-year.  The large negative free cash flow reflects still-tight deposit growth; for context, Q1 2024 free cash flow was –$15.5 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000007085824000156/bac-20240331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L4662%20Net%20cash,)), so our forecast allows for a much smaller net outflow in Q1 2025.  The resulting EPS is simply net income divided by an 8.1 B diluted share base (consistent with ~Q4 2024 levels).

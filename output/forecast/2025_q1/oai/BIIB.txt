Biogen’s recent results and guidance suggest only modest growth in new products will offset continued declines in legacy multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs.  Management’s full‐year 2025 guidance calls for a mid‐single‐digit revenue decline ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=Full%20year%202025%20financial%20guidance%3A,25)).  For context, Q1 2024 revenue was $2,290.5M ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/27926/html#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20%20,2%2C463.0)); Q4 2024 revenue was $2,455M ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=Q4%20%2724%20%20,%7C%20N%2FA)), growing 3% YoY on strength in launches.  We assume Q1 2025 will see similar dynamics: roughly flat to slightly lower revenue as new product growth (Leqembi, Skyclarys, Zurzuvae) partially offsets further MS declines ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-and-provides-full-year-2025-financial-gui-49035048/#:~:text=continued%20sequential%20growth%20,has%20nearly%20doubled%20the%20number)) ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/27926/html#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20%20,2%2C463.0)).  A ~4% YoY decline is reasonable, implying Q1 2025 revenue ≈ $2.20B.  

Operating income and EBITDA follow from this outlook.  Biogen’s Q1 2024 operating income (income before tax) was $464.8M ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/27926/html#:~:text=Income%20before%20income%20tax%20,387.9)).  With similar cost controls (“Fit for Growth” program) and a slightly lower revenue base, we project Q1 2025 operating income around $450M.  Adding back depreciation & amortization (Q1 2024 D&A was $147.5M ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/27926/html#:~:text=match%20at%20L516%20Depreciation%20and,75.6))), EBITDA comes to roughly $600M. 

Net income and EPS are based on ~145–146M shares outstanding ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/28531/html#:~:text=%E2%80%A2For%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,shares%20were%20approximately%20146%20million)).  Q1 2024 GAAP net income was $393.4M ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/27926/html#:~:text=Income%20before%20income%20tax%20,387.9)) (EPS $2.70).  We forecast Q1 2025 net income ≈ $370M (after assumed tax rates similar to Q3’s ~14% ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/28531/html#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Third%20quarter%202024%20net%20cash,capital%20expenditures%2C%20was%20approximately%20%24901%C2%A0million))), implying GAAP EPS ≈ $2.60.  Free cash flow historically runs very high (Q3 2024 FCF was ~$901M ([investors.biogen.com](https://investors.biogen.com/node/28531/html#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Third%20quarter%202024%20net%20cash,capital%20expenditures%2C%20was%20approximately%20%24901%C2%A0million)) for a bigger revenue quarter); we estimate Q1 2025 FCF on the order of $800M, reflecting sustained strong cash conversion.  

The table below summarizes our Q1 2025 forecasts using these assumptions:

| Company     | Year | Quarter | Revenue    | EBITDA     | Operating Income | Net Income | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|-------------|------|---------|------------|------------|------------------|------------|----------------|------|
| Biogen Inc. | 2025 | 1       | 2200000000 | 600000000  | 450000000        | 370000000  | 800000000      | 2.60 |

Based on AMD’s latest guidance and trends, we use the midpoint revenue guidance of ~$7.1 billion ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,expected%20to%20be%20approximately%2054)) and historical margins to forecast Q1 2025 metrics.  For context, AMD’s Q4 2024 GAAP results were revenue $7.658 B, operating income $871 M and net income $482 M ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Revenue%20%28%24M%29%20%20,Down%2037)).  Our Q1 2025 projections (in full-dollar terms) are shown below:

| Company | Year | Quarter | Revenue | EBITDA        | Operating Income | Net Income | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |
|:--------|:-----|:--------|:--------|:--------------|:-----------------|:-----------|:---------------|:-----|
| AMD     | 2025 | 1       | 7100000000 | 2000000000   | 600000000       | 480000000  | 600000000      | 0.29 |

**Notes:** Revenue is set to $7.1 B per AMD’s guidance ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,expected%20to%20be%20approximately%2054)). EBITDA (non-GAAP) is roughly estimated from expected gross margin (~54%) and operating costs. Operating Income and Net Income are GAAP-based estimates (reflecting similar seasonal expense patterns as in 2024). Free Cash Flow assumes higher cash from operations (~12–14% of revenue) minus capex. EPS is diluted (GAAP) based on ~1.66 B shares outstanding; 480 M net income yields ~$0.29 per share.

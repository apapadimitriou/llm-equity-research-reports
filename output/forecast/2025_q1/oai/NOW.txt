**Revenue.** ServiceNow guided Q1’25 subscription revenue of $2.995–3.000 billion ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=Subscription%20revenues%20%20,20.5)). Q1’24 actual subscription revenue was $2.523 billion ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,year)). We assume revenue at the high end of guidance: ~$2.998 B plus ~$83 M in services (≈3% of subs), or ~$3.081 B total (≈18–19% YoY growth). This aligns with the 24% revenue growth seen in Q1’24 ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,year)). 

**Profitability & EPS.** GAAP operating margin has been ~12–13%: Q1’24 GAAP operating income was $332 M (13% of $2,603 M) ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,)). We forecast ~12.3% GAAP margin on $3.081 B, or ~$380 M operating income. Adding back D&A (≈$180 M) yields EBITDA ≈$715 M. We assume ~17% tax and ~$100 M interest income (per recent rates), giving net income ≈$386 M. With ~210 M shares outstanding ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=,)), EPS is ~$1.84. 

**Cash Flow.** Q1’24 free cash flow was $1.225 B (47% of revenue) ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,2)). ServiceNow expects FY25 FCF margin ~32% ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,210)), so we conservatively model Q1’25 FCF ≈$1.30 B (≈42% of revenue), reflecting continued strong cash conversion. All forecasts are summarized below.

| Company          | Year | Quarter | Revenue     | EBITDA      | Operating Income | Net Income  | Free Cash Flow | EPS  |

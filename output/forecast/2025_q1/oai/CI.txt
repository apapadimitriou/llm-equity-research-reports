Cigna has shown strong growth across its businesses: Q1 2024 revenue was **$57.3B** ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2024-results-raises-2024-outlook-302133752.html#:~:text=,97%20per%20share)) (up 23% YOY ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2024-results-raises-2024-outlook-302133752.html#:~:text=,reflecting%20several%20large%20client%20wins))), and full-year 2024 revenue was $247.1B ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20%20,195%2C265)).  Evernorth’s robust expansion drove these gains, even as the Company worked through one-time items (e.g. a VillageMD investment loss in Q1 2024 led to a net loss of $277M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739940/000173994024000015/ci-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20%28loss%29%20income%20%20,39))).  For 2025, Cigna has guided to adjusted operating income of ≥$7.9B (≈$29.50 EPS) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=share%20,50%20per%20share)), and it completed the sale of its Medicare business on Mar 19, 2025 ([www.healthcaredive.com](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cigna-hcsc-close-medicare-sale/743040/#:~:text=Dive%20Brief%3A)).  Based on these trends and guidance, we project **Q1 2025 revenue ≈$65.5B**, about +15% YOY.  Adding back non‐cash amortization (≈$0.37B) to operating income yields **EBITDA ≈$2.8B**.  We estimate **Operating Income** around **$2.35B**.  Excluding the prior-year’s investment losses and using full YE 2024 tax rates, we forecast **Net Income ≈$1.30B**, implying **EPS ≈$4.80** (using ~273.7M shares ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739940/000173994025000009/ci-20241231.htm#:~:text=As%20of%20January%C2%A031%2C%202025%2C%20273%2C678%2C464,registrant%27s%20Common%20Stock%20were%20outstanding))).  For **Free Cash Flow**, Q1 2024 CFO was $4.84B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739940/000173994024000015/ci-20240331.htm#:~:text=Other%2C%20net%20%20,)) with capex $0.30B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739940/000173994024000015/ci-20240331.htm#:~:text=Property%20and%20equipment%20purchases%2C%20net,%282%2C983%29)) (FCF ~$4.54B).  Assuming higher revenues and similar capex, we project **FCF ≈$4.8B**.

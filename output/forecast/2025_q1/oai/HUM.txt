Based on Humana’s recent results and guidance, we expect Q1 2025 to show modestly lower revenues and profits.  Humana grew revenues ~10–11% in 2024 (Q1’24 revenues were $29.611 billion ([press.humana.com](https://press.humana.com/news/news-details/2024/Humana-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-Affirms-Full-Year-Adjusted-2024-Financial-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenues%20%20,)), Q4’24 $29.213 billion ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2025/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results--provides.html#:~:text=Revenues%20,%24106%2C374))).  However, Humana now expects ~10% membership declines in 2025 ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2025/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results--provides.html#:~:text=,CenterWell%20strategies%3B%20expected%20to%20drive)).  Accounting for lower Medicare Advantage membership and continued high medical cost ratios (Q1’24 benefit ratio 88.9% ([press.humana.com](https://press.humana.com/news/news-details/2024/Humana-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-Affirms-Full-Year-Adjusted-2024-Financial-Guidance/default.aspx#:~:text=Benefit%20ratio%20%20,))), we project Q1’25 revenue around $28.0 billion.  With operating expenses remaining high, operating income will be substantially below last year’s $1.236 billion (Q1’24) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907124000023/hum-20240331.htm#:~:text=Operating%20costs%20%20,1%2C614)).  We estimate EBITDA by adding back depreciation/amortization (~$200M) to this lowered operating income.  Net income should similarly decline (Q1’24 net $741M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907124000023/hum-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,9.91))) due to the operating loss offset by investment income; we project roughly $600M net income.  Free cash flow is expected to be positive but modest, given weak Q1 2024 cash flow ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907124000023/hum-20240331.htm#:~:text=Net%20cash%20provided%20by%20operating,%2873%29)).  Using ~121 million shares, EPS comes to about $5.05.  These forecasts are summarized below.  

| Company      | Year | Quarter |   Revenue    |   EBITDA     | Operating Income |  Net Income  | Free Cash Flow |  EPS  |
|-------------|------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|------|
| Humana Inc. | 2025 | 1       | 28,000,000,000   | 1,200,000,000   | 1,000,000,000    | 600,000,000  | 350,000,000     | 5.05 |

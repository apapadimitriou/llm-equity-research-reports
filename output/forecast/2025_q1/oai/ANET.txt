Arista’s own guidance for Q1 2025 was $1.93–1.97B in revenue ([www.arista.com](https://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/21096-pr-20250218#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,2025%2C%20we%20expect)).  Given Q1 2024 actuals (revenue $1.571B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1596532/000159653224000171/ex991q124-earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Revenue%20of%C2%A0%241,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202023))) and continued strong demand, we forecast roughly $1.95B.  Assuming ~63% gross margin (as guided) and operating expenses in line with recent levels, we project ~$820M of operating income (≈42% of sales).  Adding back ~\$15M of depreciation gives EBITDA ≈\$835M.  After a modest tax rate, net income is roughly \$700M.  Arista generated \$3.708B of operating cash flow in FY2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1596532/000159653225000028/anet-20241231.htm#:~:text=Deferred%20revenue%20%20,492%2C813)), so Q1 2025 cash flow should remain high.  If Q1 operating cash flow is ~\$600M and capital expenditures ~\$15M, free cash flow ≈\$585M.  With ~1.261B shares outstanding ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1596532/000159653225000028/anet-20241231.htm#:~:text=On%20February%C2%A012%2C%202025%2C%201%2C261%2C122%2C596%20shares,registrant%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock%20were%20outstanding)), this implies EPS ≈\$0.56.  The table below summarizes these forecasts.

### Analyst Note  
S&P Global reported robust growth in Q1 2025, with revenue of $3.78B (up 8% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $4.37 (up 9%) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-First-Quarter-2025-Supplemental-49753024/#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,%2B7)).  These results exceeded consensus (EPS ~$4.23) on broad strength in subscription services and profitability.  Management highlighted across-the-board division growth (“strong growth in all five divisions,” led by durable subscription revenue) ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,of%20capital%20allocation%20returning%20over)) and overall margin expansion.  Capital returns remain aggressive: over $0.9B was returned to shareholders in Q1 via dividends and buybacks ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,quarter%20through%20dividends%20and%20repurchases)).  On April 29 the company announced plans to spin off its Mobility segment into a standalone auto-data company ([investor.spglobal.com](https://investor.spglobal.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/SP-Global-Announces-Intent-to-Separate-Mobility-Segment-into-Standalone-Public-Company/default.aspx#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2029%2C%202025,becoming%20a%20standalone%20public%20company)).  This portfolio simplification will leave four core “essential intelligence” businesses (Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, and Indices) ([investor.spglobal.com](https://investor.spglobal.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/SP-Global-Announces-Intent-to-Separate-Mobility-Segment-into-Standalone-Public-Company/default.aspx#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20will%20continue%20as,and%20S%26P%20Dow%20Jones%20Indices)) and is expected to unlock strategic focus.  The stock trade near 31× 2025 EPS, high historically.  Our updated thesis stresses the secular resilience of ratings and data analytics but notes near-term share-price premium.  The mobility separation (announced after the quarter) reduces earnings disclosure complexity and should improve the analytics focus, but carries execution risk.  Mixed industry cues (stable credit markets but some rate volatility) prompt a moderate outlook.  We forecast mid-single-digit organic growth and gradually rising profit margins, supporting continued EPS gains, but see the current valuation as demanding. 

### Business Description  
S&P Global provides “essential intelligence” — independent data, analytics, benchmarks and workflow tools — to government and corporate decision-makers in financial, commodity and automotive markets ([investor.spglobal.com](https://investor.spglobal.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/SP-Global-Reports-First-Quarter-Results-Announces-Intended-Separation-of-Mobility-Division/default.aspx#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20,accelerate%20progress%20for%20the%20world)).  Its offering includes credit and market intelligence, commodity price data, benchmarks (indices and ratings), and automotive lifecycle data.  The company operates five reportable segments, four of which remain after the planned spin-off of Mobility: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights (Platts), Mobility (to be spun off), and S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Market Intelligence (including SPGI’s Capital IQ services) is the largest revenue segment, delivering financial data platforms and research ([www.morningstar.com.au](https://www.morningstar.com.au/investments/security/nyse/spgi/summary#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20provides%20data%20and,Carfax%29%2C%20and%20indexes)).  Ratings is the most profitable segment, as S&P’s credit ratings are the world’s largest ratings agency.  Commodity Insights provides price assessments and analytics for energy and materials markets.  Indices maintains and licenses a variety of stock and bond indices, benchmarks, and ESG/sustainability indices.  Mobility (currently part of S&P but being carved out) delivers automotive data and services (including CARFAX, Polk, and dealer/finance analytics) spanning vehicle valuation, insurance, and strategic planning.  In 2024 the company generated $14.21B in revenue (up 14% YoY) and $3.852B in net income ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=Consolidated%20Statements%20of%20Income)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=Less%3A%20net%20income%20attributable%20to,10.20)) across these businesses.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
S&P Global’s strategy centers on leveraging its comprehensive data ecosystem and technology to drive recurring revenue growth and margin expansion.  By integrating acquisitions like Visible Alpha (consensus data) and other analytic platforms, it is building out high-value “thoughtware” for markets.  The company emphasizes AI and data integration: for example, its Capital IQ Pro platform now includes Visible Alpha consensus models and text analysis tools (ProntoNLP) to enhance research capabilities ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20we%20acquired%20Visible,challenges%20and%20risks%2C%20as%20the)).  S&P also targets expanding in “high-growth adjacencies” such as private credit ops, climate analytics, and ESG/sustainability data.  It has invested in energy and climate analytics (World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition) to capture rising demand for energy transition intelligence.  In parallel, S&P Global is simplifying its portfolio (spinning off Mobility) to concentrate on its core financial and data markets, expecting synergies in product development and AI deployment ([investor.spglobal.com](https://investor.spglobal.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/SP-Global-Announces-Intent-to-Separate-Mobility-Segment-into-Standalone-Public-Company/default.aspx#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20will%20continue%20as,and%20S%26P%20Dow%20Jones%20Indices)).  

Secular trends tend to favor S&P Global’s model: financial markets and corporations increasingly rely on data and benchmarks (e.g. debt issuance needs ratings, asset managers need indices, corporates need supply chain analytics).  Global regulatory frameworks also cement the role of major rating agencies.  S&P benefits from increasing data consumption (cloud delivery, APIs) and a global footprint (cross-border data services).  However, some cyclical headwinds are present: credit rating revenue can fluctuate with issuance volumes, and macroeconomic volatility can pinch corporate spending.  In recent quarters, modest new issuance in credit markets and interest-rate normalization have tempered growth; management now guides full-year 2025 revenue growth of roughly 4–6% ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Outlook%20%26%20Guidance)), well below the double-digit pace of 2024.  The company continues to invest for the long term while keeping expenses in check, which has driven operating margin expansion (roughly +240 bp TTM ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,of%20capital%20allocation%20returning%20over))).  We anticipate mid-single-digit revenue CAGR over 2025–29 as Negative impacts of divestitures (Fincentric, PrimeOne) roll off and the base business accelerates.  Combined with ongoing operating leverage and productivity in SG&A and R&D, this should support gradually rising EBITDA and net margins.  

### Bulls Say  
1. **Durable, recurring revenues:** A large majority of business is recurring (subscriptions, licensing).  Q1 2025 subscription revenues grew ~7% YoY and continue to account for the bulk of sales ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,of%20capital%20allocation%20returning%20over)).  The global data/business analytics market is growing, implying steady demand for S&P’s services (e.g. credit ratings, indices).  
2. **High returns on capital:** S&P Global’s operations are highly efficient.  Its analytical services and ratings have high incremental margins, and the Intx business returned to ~39% operating margin in 2024 (up from 32% in 2023) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=Consolidated%20Statements%20of%20Income)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm)).  Intangibles like index and data licensing yield very high returns on invested capital.  
3. **Industry leadership and switching costs:** As the leading credit rating agency and benchmark provider, S&P enjoys regulatory moats and strong brand trust.  Clients (asset managers, banks, governments) rely on S&P metrics and data across workflows, creating high switching costs.  For example, its credit ratings are embedded in regulations and contracts worldwide.  Analysts note S&P Global “benefits from a wide economic moat due to significant intangible assets, network effects, and efficient scale,” supporting long-term pricing power ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/spgi/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc%20benefits%20from,term)).  
4. **Rising importance of data/AI:** The company is leveraging AI to deliver more efficient, higher-value products.  The integration of Visible Alpha and Pronto’s AI-text engines into existing platforms bolsters differentiation.  Generative AI trends could further increase demand for machine-readable data from established providers.  
5. **Capital returns discipline:** Management has a track record of returning cash judiciously.  In Q1 alone S&P returned over $900M via dividends and buybacks ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,quarter%20through%20dividends%20and%20repurchases)).  Credit metrics are moderate (net debt ~2.0× EBITDA ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-First-Quarter-2025-Supplemental-49753024/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents1%20,1.6x))), allowing continued share repurchases without sacrificing balance sheet strength.  Bulls view this as positive for share price support.

### Bears Say  
1. **Cyclicality and slower growth:** Key end markets (debt issuance, M&A activity, commodity flows) can be volatile.  Insipid debt markets or tighter economics could drive down Ratings and Platts revenue.  Despite Q1 growth, management’s full-year guidance (4–6%) is well below last year’s pace ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Outlook%20%26%20Guidance)).  Bears worry that high valuation (P/E ~30× 2025E) leaves little margin for error if growth disappoints.  
2. **High valuation:** The stock trades at historically rich multiples (~50× 2023 EPS, ~30× 2025 EPS) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=,321.9)) ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Financial%20Highlights)), reflecting very optimistic expectations.  Any subtle slowdown in margins or revenue could trigger a repricing.  Some investors note that similar data companies have sold off after raising guidance (risk of a valuation pullback).  
3. **Regulatory and geopolitical risk:** S&P Global Ratings operates in highly regulated markets.  Changes in EU/UK regulations on rating agencies, or geopolitical restrictions (e.g. trade sanctions) could complicate its business.  For example, any ruling affecting access to emerging market sovereign ratings could dent growth.  (CRAs like S&P have also faced legal scrutiny in past market cycles.)  
4. **Competition and innovation risk:** Specialized data providers and fintechs (Bloomberg, Fitch Connect, FactSet, Refinitiv, etc.) compete globally.  With smaller, agile players entering data/AI fields, S&P might face pricing pressure or tech disruption.  Internally, shifts to cloud AI entail cost and execution risks.  Failures to protect its proprietary data/models against IP theft or cyberattacks is also flagged as a material risk ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=concerns%2C%20cybersecurity%20concerns%2C%20intellectual%20property,products%20or%20services%2C%20to%20improve)).  
5. **Execution risk of spin-off:** Separating Mobility (expected in 2026/27) involves transitional expenses and possible market misunderstanding.  Investors may be uncertain about how the pro forma financials look for each entity.  Any missteps could temporarily weigh on S&P’s core share price.  This is compounded by the fact that Mobility currently contributes ~10% of revenue; its absence raises growth expectations on the remaining businesses.

### Economic Moat  
S&P Global’s moat arises from its entrenched market positions and data advantages.  Its credit ratings and index businesses are deeply embedded in financial systems, creating regulatory and customer stickiness.  As noted by analysts, S&P “benefits from a wide economic moat due to significant intangible assets, network effects, and efficient scale,” which together protect its market position and profitability ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/spgi/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc%20benefits%20from,term)).  Key moat factors include: *Regulatory barriers* (a ratings agency requires approvals); *Switching costs/network effects* (clients build processes around S&P data products and indices); and *Brand/IP strength* (the S&P and Dow Jones marks are globally recognized).  The company also owns valuable exclusive indexes and pricing benchmarks used by fund managers and exchanges.  These attributes give S&P sustainable pricing power and high free cash generation.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our model assumes modest growth and margin improvements consistent with management’s guidance.  Specifically, we use ~5–6% revenue CAGR for 2025–29 (in line with full-year growth targets ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Outlook%20%26%20Guidance))), and assume operating margins stabilize around 39–40% as cost synergies offset legacy amortization expenses.  We apply an effective tax rate of roughly 22% (as seen in Q1) and assume capital expenditures remain low (~1% of revenue).  Using a WACC of ~8% and a 2% terminal growth rate, our discounted cash flow yields an implied equity value around the low-$300s per share.  This corresponds to an EV/EBIT of roughly mid-teens and a P/E of ~25× on 2025E EPS.  In sum, our fair value estimate (~$400) is below the current price, reflecting high market expectations.  At the valuation of $400, the implied 2025 P/E is roughly 23× and EV/EBIT ~15×, which lies near historical upper bounds for the stock.  Key profit drivers include continued subscription growth, integration of recent acquisitions (e.g. Visible Alpha’s consensus data boosts recurring analytics sales), and expense discipline driving margin expansion.  Share count is expected to decline slightly (further buybacks) which boosts EPS.  Assuming these inputs, our model implies long-term 2029 EPS growth of ~8–10% annually (before the spin-off) and stable high returns on invested capital.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Risks that could materially affect valuation include economic, regulatory, and operational factors.  Macroeconomic swings (e.g. a sharp economic downturn) could reduce issuance volumes and corporate spending on analytics.  Geopolitical tensions or sanctions might limit access to global clients.  On the regulatory front, changes to credit rating agency oversight (EU/UK rules) or negative judicial rulings on data use could impact operations.  Technological risks include cybersecurity breaches or AI-related disruptions: S&P has noted that data protection and IP security are critical concerns ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=concerns%2C%20cybersecurity%20concerns%2C%20intellectual%20property,products%20or%20services%2C%20to%20improve)).  Competitive pressures from new analytics providers or in-house solutions pose uncertainty.  A rapid shift in industry standards (e.g. novel benchmarking methods) could require further investment.  The timing and success of spinning off the Mobility segment is another uncertainty factor.  Additionally, ESG-related risks (detailed below) could influence market perceptions.  These factors underscore the stock’s *Medium* uncertainty rating: while core businesses are stable, multiple external factors could swing results in either direction.  

### Capital Allocation  
S&P Global has a conservative balance sheet (debt ~$11.4B vs cash ~$1.5B at Q1 2025 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-First-Quarter-2025-Supplemental-49753024/#:~:text=,1.6x)), net debt ~2.0× adjusted EBITDA) and strong cash flows, allowing disciplined capital deployment.  The company funds modest acquisitions (e.g. fintech data firms) to augment growth areas, while returning capital primarily via dividends and repurchases.  The quarterly dividend ($0.96 in early 2025) yields only ~0.2%, indicating a focus on buybacks for shareholder returns.  Indeed management repurchased stock aggressively in recent years (reducing share count by 7–8% over 2022–24) and in Q1 returned >$900M ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-sp-global-beats-q1-2025-earnings-expectations-93CH-1888378#:~:text=Martina%20Chung%2C%20President%20and%20Chief,quarter%20through%20dividends%20and%20repurchases)).  There is no large net debt repayment plan announced; leverage remains moderate.  Given its high ROIC, we rate capital allocation as *Standard*: management has a consistent buyback/dividend policy but no exceptional activist track record.  We expect similar discipline going forward, with continued cash flow generation used to repay debt as needed and return surplus to owners.

Estimates 2025–29 assume ~5–6% revenue CAGR and ~40% operating margin. ROIC approximate NOPAT/total assets (see Appendix).  

### ESG Risk  
S&P Global’s operations have generally moderate ESG risk.  On the environmental front, its direct carbon footprint is relatively low (mainly offices and data centers) and the company offers products that help clients understand climate risk.  Mobility (at an eventual spin-off) has higher exposure through vehicle data and dealerships, but MTBE.  Socially, data privacy and workforce diversity are focus areas.  Governance risks include impartiality of ratings/indices and transparency (recent push to clarify ESG-scores processes).  Sustainalytics (Morningstar) classifies S&P Global in the *Medium* risk range (roughly 10–20 risk score) compared to industry, reflecting adequate governance and no major controversies.  Its peers (MSCI, Moody’s, ICE) have similar ESG profiles.  Key material issues include data security (cybersecurity of client data), transparency of rating methodologies, and managing social impacts of auto/energy transition.  Overall, the company’s core markets (financial data/rating) have moderate ESG risk relative to pure industrial peers.  

### Appendix  
**Valuation Assumptions:** Revenue CAGR ~6% (2025–29); Terminal growth 2%; Tax rate ~22%; Operating margin ~40%; WACC ~8%. Share count declines modestly (buybacks). FCF conversion ~90% of net income. Implied long-run P/E ~25× 2025 EPS.  

**Glossary of Ratings:**

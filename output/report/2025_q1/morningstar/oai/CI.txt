### Analyst Note  
Cigna delivered a strong first-quarter 2025, reporting $1.3B in net income ($4.85 per share) versus a loss in Q1 2024, driven by robust growth in its Evernorth health services business ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=,8)) ([www.insurancebusinessmag.com](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/cigna-reports-1-3-billion-quarterly-profit-and-lifts-2025-forecast-534330.aspx#:~:text=The%20Bloomfield%2C%20Conn.,per%20share%2C%20surpassing%20analysts%E2%80%99%20expectations)). Revenues rose 14% to $65.5B ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=,8)), reflecting continued client wins in pharmacy and care services, while higher costs in stop-loss insurance were contained below analysts’ fears ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cigna-raises-full-year-profit-forecast-latest-beat-medical-cost-estimates-2025-05-02/#:~:text=projection.%20First,year%20outlook)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=Cigna%E2%80%99s%20medical%20cost%20ratio%2C%20which,in%202023)). Management raised 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $29.60 (from $29.50) ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%246,2)), signaling confidence in Evernorth and commercial insurance platforms despite ongoing medical price pressure. For full-year 2024, Cigna saw total revenues jump 27% to $247.1B ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=Still%2C%20Cigna%20said%20total%20revenues,4)) on Evernorth expansion, though GAAP net income fell to $3.4B ($12.12/share) after a one-time $2.7B asset impairment ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=,33%20per%20share)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Shareholders%27%20net%20income%20for%202024,39%20per%20share%2C%20for%202023)). Differences in earnings largely stemmed from that non-cash charge.  

Strategically, Cigna is refocusing on core employer and health-services markets. It completed the $3.3B sale of its Medicare benefits business to HCSC in March 2025 ([www.insurancebusinessmag.com](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/cigna-reports-1-3-billion-quarterly-profit-and-lifts-2025-forecast-534330.aspx#:~:text=The%20increase%2C%20the%20company%20said%2C,a%20medical%20services%20administration%20business)), reducing exposure to a turbulent government segment. CEO David Cordani emphasizes a “sustainable model” built on transparency and value for customers ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=,platforms%20in%20a%20dynamic%20environment)). Credit agencies note Cigna’s combined insurance/PBM structure “adds size and scale” to compete with large peers ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20and%20Cigna,to%20the%20highest%20possible%20category)). Strong capitalization (RBC ratio ~264%) and ongoing share buybacks ($7B repurchased in 2024) support shareholder returns ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=and%20adjusted%20SG%26A%20expense%20ratio,3%20billion%20as%20of%20December)). In an environment where competitors had pared forecasts for rising healthcare costs, Cigna’s results “helped ease fears of a sector-wide crunch” ([www.insurancebusinessmag.com](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/cigna-reports-1-3-billion-quarterly-profit-and-lifts-2025-forecast-534330.aspx#:~:text=The%20results%20offered%20reassurance%20to,wide%20crunch)). The company appears positioned for stable growth driven by Evernorth services and core health plans, even as it navigates macro headwinds.  

### Business Description  
Cigna is a global health services company organized around two main platforms: **Cigna Healthcare** (insurance plans and related services) and **Evernorth Health Services** (health and pharmacy benefit services) ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20and%20Cigna,to%20the%20highest%20possible%20category)) ([newsroom.thecignagroup.com](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/2025-01-14-The-Cigna-Groups-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Release-Details#:~:text=Healthcare%2C%20Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20or,com)). Cigna Healthcare offers employer-sponsored medical, dental, behavioral health and other plans, along with Medicare Advantage and Medicaid products (now being divested) and international health plans. Evernorth includes Express Scripts (a major pharmacy benefit manager) plus specialty pharmacy and care services. Together, these businesses served over 182 million customer relationships worldwide at 2024 year-end ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Customer%20Relationships%20)) (up 11% y/y). Cigna maintains sales operations in 30+ markets ([newsroom.thecignagroup.com](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/2025-01-14-The-Cigna-Groups-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Earnings-Release-Details#:~:text=Healthcare%2C%20Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20or,com)), with the majority of revenue from the U.S. Its 2024 revenues were $247.1B, with Cigna Healthcare contributing roughly $45B and Evernorth ~$202B ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20%20,57)).  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Cigna’s competitive edge lies in scale and diversified capabilities. Credit analysts note that Cigna’s “industry-leading” segments—full-service pharmacy platform and health insurance—provide substantial scale and unregulated cash flow ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20and%20Cigna,to%20the%20highest%20possible%20category)). The Evernorth unit leverages pharmacy cost management and specialty drugs to lower costs and improve outcomes, while Cigna Healthcare focuses on employer-sponsored and stable government plans. Management highlights shifts to value-based care and greater transparency to reinforce customer loyalty ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=,platforms%20in%20a%20dynamic%20environment)). Recent strategic moves (exiting less profitable Medicare Advantage, doubling down on Evernorth) aim to align resources with these priorities. Secular trends favor Cigna’s mix: demand for cost-effective pharmacy benefits (e.g. managing specialty drug costs through formularies) and integrated care services is rising. Weight-loss drug cost management in the PBM, for example, is a growing focus (e.g., a new program to manage GLP-1 obesity drug costs). In the medium term, we assume mid-single-digit organic revenue growth (reflecting Evernorth strength and flat insurance enrollment after divestitures) and modest margin expansion. Cigna’s high capital and liquidity profile (RBC ~264%) provides financial flexibility to sustain investments and buybacks.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**(1) Bulls:**  
1. **Integrated Scale & Returns:** Fitch notes Cigna’s combined Evernorth/PBM and insurance structure “adds size and scale” to compete effectively ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20and%20Cigna,to%20the%20highest%20possible%20category)). Evernorth’s growth – pharmacy revenues up 46% in 2024 – is driven by new client wins and specialty drugs ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=Evernorth%20includes%20the%20Express%20Scripts,of%20its%20pharmacy%20benefit%20services)). This diversification yields steady cash flow outside regulated insurance, supporting capital return: Cigna repurchased ~$7B shares in 2024 and raised its dividend 8% ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=and%20adjusted%20SG%26A%20expense%20ratio,3%20billion%20as%20of%20December)). High capitalization (RBC >250%) underpins financial stability.  
2. **Strong Recent Results:** Q1 2025 earnings ($1.3B net income; $6.74 adj. EPS) beat estimates ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=,8)), led by Evernorth, and Cigna raised full-year guidance to at least $29.60/share ([uk.advfn.com](https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/NYSE/CI/share-news/The-Cigna-Group-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results-Raises-2025-Outlook/95971981#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%246,2)). Investors viewed this as sector reassurance, reversing earlier anxieties about medical costs ([www.insurancebusinessmag.com](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/cigna-reports-1-3-billion-quarterly-profit-and-lifts-2025-forecast-534330.aspx#:~:text=The%20results%20offered%20reassurance%20to,wide%20crunch)).  Management focuses on high-value services and cost discipline, exemplified by continued efficiency gains (2024 adjusted SG&A ratio fell to 5.9%) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=,respectively%2C%20for%202024)). Customer metrics are growing: total pharmacy customers reached 118.3M (20% y/y lift) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=Evernorth%20includes%20the%20Express%20Scripts,of%20its%20pharmacy%20benefit%20services)). These factors imply sustained earnings growth.  

**(2) Bears:**  
1. **Cost and Profit Pressures:** Healthcare insurers face volatile medical trends. In late 2024, Cigna’s medical-cost ratio spiked (87.9% in Q4 vs 82.2% a year earlier) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=Cigna%E2%80%99s%20medical%20cost%20ratio%2C%20which,in%202023)), principally due to higher stop-loss claims, which directly cut profit ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/01/30/cigna-2024-profits-eclipse-34-billion-despite-rising-costs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhile%20higher%20medical%20costs%20in,a%20dynamic%20environment%2C%20we%20are)). Analysts will watch if cost inflation reaccelerates (e.g., new expensive drugs, pandemic-demand rebounds).  VillageMD investment led to a $2.7B impairment in 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Shareholders%27%20net%20income%20for%202024,39%20per%20share%2C%20for%202023)), underscoring execution risks in clinical ventures. Sustained margins below Fitch’s 6% threshold would attract downgrade risks ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Lead%20to%20Negative%20Rating%20Action%2FDowngrade)).  
2. **Competitive & Regulatory Risks:** Cigna’s market is highly contested and subject to regulation. The decision not to pursue a Humana merger and to divest Medicare suggests limited options for rapid scale gains ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/cigna-says-it-will-not-pursue-combination-with-humana-2024-11-11/#:~:text=rose%20over%207,in%20Q4%202024%20and%202025)) ([www.insurancebusinessmag.com](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/cigna-reports-1-3-billion-quarterly-profit-and-lifts-2025-forecast-534330.aspx#:~:text=The%20increase%2C%20the%20company%20said%2C,a%20medical%20services%20administration%20business)). Future legislative changes (drug pricing reforms, CMS reimbursement shifts) could pressure earnings. Peer insurers also worry about Trump Administration moves on PBMs (e.g. proposed elimination of rebates, outside our cutoff) which could disrupt Cigna’s business model. In sum, critics argue that Cigna’s moat is only narrow ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/ci/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Cigna%20Corp%20possesses%20a%20narrow,These%20factors%20provide%20some)) and any underperformance in managing health inflation or complex benefits could markedly impact results.  

### Economic Moat  
Morningstar-style analysis indicates Cigna has a **narrow moat**. Its competitive edge stems from intangible assets (a large client base, integrated service platform) and scale in PBM/insurance operations ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/ci/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Cigna%20Corp%20possesses%20a%20narrow,These%20factors%20provide%20some)), but these are not barriers to entry. Fitch observes that Cigna’s dual segments “bolster [its] ability to compete with other large peers” ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Evernorth%20Health%20Services%20and%20Cigna,to%20the%20highest%20possible%20category)). However, strong competition (from UnitedHealth, Humana, etc.) and regulatory constraints (e.g., on premium pricing and provider contracts) limit pricing power. Cigna’s moat is thus moderate – it has valuable capabilities, but no sustainable franchise immunity.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our base-case model projects moderate revenue growth (mid-single digits) and roughly stable adjusted margins. Key drivers include Evernorth business expansion and controlled insurance claims. We forecast revenue rising from ~$247B (2024) to ~$346B by 2029 (CAGR ~6–7%), with adjusted operating margin slowly improving as high-cost Medicare business winds down.  We assume WACC ~8.0% (with ~5% equity risk premium) and 2.0% long-term growth. Incorporating share repurchases (reducing float) and recognizing the $2.7B 2024 impairment, we neutralize that one-off. Bridging adjusted EPS: 2024 GAAP EPS $12.12 was depressed by the VillageMD loss ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=Shareholders%27%20net%20income%20for%202024,39%20per%20share%2C%20for%202023)); removing that yields ~$21.6 underlying. Extending baseline growth (~10% CAGR) implies mid-30s EPS by 2029. A DCF with these assumptions yields a fair price ≈$300.  Implied 2028 P/E is ~10–11× on our forecast EPS (and ~0.9× forward P/FV). The fair EV/EBIT multiple is roughly 10×. Small changes in WACC or growth (±1%) shift fair value by ~10%. 

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key uncertainties include healthcare cost trends, regulation and execution. A continued surge in medical costs or specialty drug prices could compress margins. Fitch notes that an EBITDA margin sustained below 6% or ROIC under ~7.5% would signal risks ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Lead%20to%20Negative%20Rating%20Action%2FDowngrade)). Government policy (e.g. drug pricing laws, ACA changes) could also affect Cigna. Operationally, misestimating stop-loss exposures or failing to control pharmacy spend would be material. The macro environment (e.g., employer coverage rates, economic cycles) influences enrollment and pricing. On governance, IFR volatility (like the VillageMD writeoff) adds noise. We assign a **medium** uncertainty rating, reflecting these factors.  

### Capital Allocation  
Cigna has a strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly capital deployment. By end-2024, insurance subsidiaries had an NAIC RBC ratio ~264% of action level ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Strong%20Risk,ability%2C%20if%20needed%2C%20to%20provide)). The parent’s debt (~2.7× operating EBITDA) is higher than peers but manageable given Evernorth’s high cash generation ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Elevated%20Financial%20Leverage%3A%20Cigna%27s%20financial,IDR%20of%20the%20holding%20company)). Cigna returned substantial capital in 2024: ~$7.0B in share repurchases and an 8% dividend hike to $1.51/qtr ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=and%20adjusted%20SG%26A%20expense%20ratio,3%20billion%20as%20of%20December)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=31%2C%202024.%20,40%20per)). The board authorized an additional $6.0B buyback (total $10.3B) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=and%20adjusted%20SG%26A%20expense%20ratio,3%20billion%20as%20of%20December)). Mergers and acquisitions have been selective; the company recently decided against a large merger and instead focuses on small deals and internal growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/cigna-says-it-will-not-pursue-combination-with-humana-2024-11-11/#:~:text=rose%20over%207,in%20Q4%202024%20and%202025)). Given Cigna’s buyback program, dividend growth and prudent leverage, we rate its capital allocation as **very attractive**.

*Financials:* 2022-24 are based on reported GAAP (2024 includes impairment), forecasts assume moderate growth and margin improvement.  

### ESG Risk  
Cigna’s industry has moderate ESG risk. Fitch assigns the company an ESG relevance score of “3”, meaning ESG factors are largely neutral to credit profile ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=The%20highest%20level%20of%20ESG,scores)). Key issues include social factors (health care access and affordability, patient privacy) and governance (ethical business practices). Environmental impact is limited in insurance operations. We estimate Sustainalytics would rate Cigna in the **medium risk** category (score ~20-30/100), similar to peers. Peer insurers (e.g. UnitedHealth) typically face comparable issues. Material ESG concerns involve drug pricing transparency, equitable coverage, and data security. Cigna’s governance disclosures and risk controls appear robust, somewhat mitigating these issues.

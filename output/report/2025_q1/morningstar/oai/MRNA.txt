### Analyst Note  
Moderna’s trajectory in Q1 2025 underscored the challenges of a post-pandemic vaccine market. Q1 revenue was just $108M, down 35% year/year ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenue%20,year%20period)), driven by seasonal declines and lower vaccination uptake. This compares to $966M in Q4 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=fourth%20quarter%20of%202024,with%20FDA%20approval)). The net loss narrowed to ≈$1.0B (≈–$2.79/sh) versus –$1.2B a year ago ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%20Total%20revenue%20,year%20period)). Cost controls helped: combined R&D and SG&A were cut ≈20% y/y (Q1 R&D $856M ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=year,year))) and cash burn fell. Moderna ended Q1 2025 with ~$8.4B cash ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%20SG%26A%20expenses%20,mainly%20due%20to%20operating%20losses)) and maintains its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $1.5–2.5B ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%202025%20revenue%20guidance%20,is%20included%20in%20current%20guidance)) (reduced from earlier $2.5–3.5B) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=Moderna%20has%20reduced%20its%202025,This%20announcement)).  

Management highlights a diversified mRNA pipeline: in late 2024 Moderna filed for FDA approval of a next-gen COVID booster, an RSV vaccine (18–59 age group), and a combined influenza/COVID shot ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Submitted%20three%20investigational%20mRNA%20products,59%2C%20and%20flu%2FCOVID%20combination%20vaccine)) ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=Australia%2C%20Taiwan%2C%20the%20U,term%20PDUFA)). Several late-stage trial readouts (e.g. flu, CMV) are due in 2025–26. The company has cut costs ~27% from 2023 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=The%20team%20has%20worked%20hard,work%20on%20opex%2C%20capex%2C%20and)) and plans another ~$1B of expense reductions in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=To%20manage%20costs%2C%20Moderna%20plans,products%20for%20growth%2C%20including%20a)), targeting operating expenses of ~$5.5B by mid-decade.  

Our update reflects ongoing uncertainty: core Spikevax COVID sales plunged to $3.1B in 2024 (from $18.4B in 2022) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,1%20billion)), and RSV uptake is still minimal ($25M in 2024) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20reported%20%2415,Arab%20Emirates%2C%20Qatar%20and%20Taiwan)). U.S. COVID shots are down ~30% ytd, collapsing Moderna’s share of the booster market, and management now sees U.S. COVID rev at only $1.0–1.3B in 2025 ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=,5%20billion)). Offsetting this, the late-stage pipeline offers upside if new approvals materialize (older-adult RSV already approved; new filings pending). We continue to assess Moderna as a ‘special situation’: strong technology but profit hinges on successful launches in an uncertain vaccine environment.

### Business Description  
Moderna (Nasdaq: MRNA) is a clinical-stage biotech focused on mRNA-based medicines. Its current commercial products are two vaccines: Spikevax® (its COVID-19 vaccine) and mRESVIA® (an RSV vaccine for older adults). In Q4 2024, Spikevax generated $923M in sales (≈$244M U.S., $679M international) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,1%20billion)); for full-year 2024 Spikevax sales were $3.1B ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,1%20billion)). mRESVIA® was launched in late 2023; Q4 2024 sales were $15M, $25M for year 2024 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20reported%20%2415,Arab%20Emirates%2C%20Qatar%20and%20Taiwan)). Moderna’s revenues have been dominated by Spikevax to date; it earned $3.2B total revenue in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=Jamey%20will%20present%20our%20financial,2%20billion)). The company sells globally (about one-third of 2024 sales were U.S.) and has supply agreements with governments and distributors worldwide. Moderna’s pipeline includes multiple vaccines (e.g. influenza, CMV, combination vaccines) and developing therapies (e.g. rare disease, oncology) – ~45 mRNA programs in development ([www.modernatx.com](https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/moderna-2024-shareholder-letter#:~:text=Our%20success%20in%20research%20and,ascribed%20to%20our%20broader%20pipeline)). Beyond COVID/RSV, priority late-stage candidates include a seasonal flu shot, a CMV vaccine, and a combination flu/COVID vaccine.

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Moderna’s strategy is to leverage its pioneering mRNA platform for rapid vaccine development and flexible manufacturing. Management has prioritized ~10 “high-value” programs (respiratory viruses, rare diseases, etc.) seen as driving future profits. It has expanded manufacturing capacity globally – recent approvals in Australia, Taiwan, the U.K., and Switzerland and new plants in Australia, Canada, and the U.K. aim to bolster resilience and local supply ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=Australia%2C%20Taiwan%2C%20the%20U,term%20PDUFA)). Moderna also pursues partnerships (e.g. with governmental projects, biotech collaborators) to co-develop or license programs. 

Cost discipline is another pillar: Moderna slashed R&D and SG&A after 2021 and plans an additional ~$1.5B in expense cuts by 2026 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=The%20team%20has%20worked%20hard,our%20focus%20on%2010%20high)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=To%20manage%20costs%2C%20Moderna%20plans,products%20for%20growth%2C%20including%20a)). These savings should protect cash runway and allow focused investment. In our view, Moderna faces a medium-term transition: traditional surges from COVID sales have subsided, so growth depends on new product approvals. If key vaccines (next-generation COVID, RSV for adults 18–59, flu combo) gain traction, they could rekindle growth by 2026–27. Conversely, failure to launch or competitive pricing pressures could prolong the downturn. We expect Moderna to maintain its R&D-heavy, capital-intensive model to fuel these pipelines, while continuing to adapt cost structure to the lower-revenue environment.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
- **Bulls**: Moderna has a **unique mRNA platform** with robust clinical success. Its mid/late-stage pipeline has a ~69% success rate vs. ~19% industry average ([www.modernatx.com](https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/moderna-2024-shareholder-letter#:~:text=Our%20success%20in%20research%20and,ascribed%20to%20our%20broader%20pipeline)), suggesting strong development capability. A steady stream of filings and approvals is imminent (RSV 60+, new-age COVID, combination flu/COVID) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Submitted%20three%20investigational%20mRNA%20products,59%2C%20and%20flu%2FCOVID%20combination%20vaccine)) ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=Australia%2C%20Taiwan%2C%20the%20U,term%20PDUFA)). The company has **$9–10B of cash** (end-2024) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=The%20team%20has%20worked%20hard,5%20billion%20of%20cash%20and)), which funds R&D and provides a buffer as sales recover. Cost cuts (~27% in 2024) have dramatically improved leverage ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=The%20team%20has%20worked%20hard,our%20focus%20on%2010%20high)). Many assume significant upside: management projects $8–$15B combined sales from respiratory vaccines by year-end 2027 (from an industry interview) and sees long-term market growth. Leadership also notes ongoing efficiency (aiming for $5–$6B cash expense by 2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=To%20manage%20costs%2C%20Moderna%20plans,products%20for%20growth%2C%20including%20a)). If new products gain market share (Moderna leads in RSV, and a next-delta flu/COVID combo may dominate markets), revenue could rebound strongly.

- **Bears**: Moderna’s current **business is concentrated and declining**. COVID vaccine sales have cratered (Spikevax fell from $18B in 2021 to ~$3.1B in 2024 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,1%20billion))), and RSV so far contributes only minimal revenue ($25M in 2024) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20reported%20%2415,Arab%20Emirates%2C%20Qatar%20and%20Taiwan)). The 2025 sales outlook was slashed (guidance now $1.5–2.5B ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%202025%20revenue%20guidance%20,is%20included%20in%20current%20guidance)) vs. $2.5–3.5B earlier ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=Moderna%20has%20reduced%20its%202025,This%20announcement))) due to weak uptake. U.S. vaccination rates are down ~30% ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=,5%20billion)), and Moderna’s turned-in Q1 U.S. COVID sales were just $29M (vs much higher totals at Pfizer). Profitability is far off: Moderna lost $3.6B in 2024 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Reports%20full,28)) (GAAP), and operating costs (R&D ~$4.5B; SG&A ~$1.3B planned ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Research%20and%20Development%20Expenses%3A%20The,8%20billion%20in%202023))) still exceed any revenue. Pipeline bets are unproven: e.g., a Phase 2 CMV trial recently fell short of efficacy targets ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=revenue%20expectations%20to%20a%20range,efficacy%20targets%20in%20the%20study)). Patent/IP litigation adds uncertainty (Moderna lost a recent U.S. patent ruling to Pfizer/BioNTech ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/pfizer-convinces-us-patent-office-cancel-two-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-patents-2025-03-05/#:~:text=Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20scored%20a,Moderna%20filed%20for%20the%20patents))). Given these issues, skeptics argue Moderna may struggle for years with flat revenue, making today’s valuation optimistic.

### Economic Moat  
Moderna’s **moat is narrow**. The company’s core advantage is its proprietary mRNA technology and rapid-development platform, which enabled early vaccine leadership (and is highlighted by its high pipeline success rate ([www.modernatx.com](https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/moderna-2024-shareholder-letter#:~:text=Our%20success%20in%20research%20and,ascribed%20to%20our%20broader%20pipeline))). However, key patents have been challenged (recent U.S. PTAB rulings invalidated major COVID vaccine patents ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/pfizer-convinces-us-patent-office-cancel-two-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-patents-2025-03-05/#:~:text=Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20scored%20a,Moderna%20filed%20for%20the%20patents))), and competitors (Pfizer/BioNTech, Sanofi, others) also access mRNA. There are low switching costs for vaccine customers (governments/health systems can choose alternatives) and manufacturers are expanding. Moderna has yet to diversify beyond vaccines into, say, blockbuster therapeutics. Thus any advantage is subject to new entrants and intense competition. In sum, we see at most a **narrow moat** supported by technology know-how and scale, with sustainability hinging on continuous innovation (e.g. winning more approvals to justify its competitive position).

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
We model Moderna’s cash flows using a mid-case forecast of product adoption. Key drivers: post-pandemic COVID booster sales (our model assumes modest growth from 2025 onward, as new variants and next-gen boosters enter market) and launch of pipeline vaccines (RSV 18–59 yr, seasonal flu, CMV, etc.). We start from 2024 actuals (Revenue $3.2B ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=Jamey%20will%20present%20our%20financial,2%20billion)), Operating loss ≈–113% margin, EPS –$9.28 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Reports%20full,28))). We forecast revenue dipping to ~$2.0B in 2025 (reflecting the guide midpoint) and gradually rising 15–20% p.a. by late decade as RSV and influenza products ramp; by 2029 revenue is ~$5–6B in our base case. We assume operating margin improves from strongly negative (–50% in 2025) to breakeven around 2027–28 and ~25–30% by 2029, as cost base stabilizes and higher-margin products launch. We use a WACC ~10.5% and terminal growth ~2.5%. The resulting fair value is roughly **$40** per share (implied P/E ~20× 2029 EPS; EV/2029 revenue ~5×). At the market price (~$25), Moderna trades below this FVE, reflecting the bears’ concerns. (Without concrete guidance beyond 2025, these inputs are uncertain and should be adjusted as new data arrive.)

### Risk & Uncertainty  
- **Revenue Risk**: Vaccine demand could flux (e.g. if new COVID variants prompt booster drives or if uptake remains very low). Moderna’s guidance range (wide) reflects this uncertainty.  
- **Regulatory Risk**: Key products (RSV for 18–59, combo vaccines) await approval. Delays or negative outcomes would sharply cut forecasts.  
- **Competition & Pricing**: Products face rivals (e.g. Pfizer’s vaccines, new players). Government purchasers may negotiate prices aggressively.  
- **Execution Risk**: Achieving cost‐cut targets while funding R&D is challenging. Supply chain/distribution missteps or manufacturing yield problems could raise COGS (currently very high — Q1 cost-of-sales was 104% of product sales ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/11/moderna-mrna-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/#:~:text=%2A%20Product%20sales%20,reflecting%20ongoing%20cost%20reduction%20efforts))).  
- **Legal/Patent Risk**: Ongoing litigation with Pfizer/BioNTech poses downside. Notably, in Mar 2025 two Moderna patents were invalidated by a US Board ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/pfizer-convinces-us-patent-office-cancel-two-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-patents-2025-03-05/#:~:text=Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20scored%20a,Moderna%20filed%20for%20the%20patents)); USD cases continue. Patent outcomes could affect royalties and exclusivity.  
- **Macro/Financial Risk**: Macroeconomic factors (e.g. inflation, funding for public health) could affect budgets for vaccines or R&D. As a cash-burner with no earnings, any tightening in capital markets could raise its cost of capital.  
- **Environmental/Social**: As a pharma company, Moderna faces R&D safety (trial risks) and raw-materials supply issues. ESG related: its Sustainalytics risk score is low (19.6) ([www.knowesg.com](https://www.knowesg.com/esg-ratings/moderna-inc#:~:text=Moderna%2C%20Inc,on%20therapeutic%20areas%20such%20as)), but missteps (e.g. trial ethics, supply-chain labor) could earn reputational risk.

### Capital Allocation  
Moderna has a very **strong balance sheet**: ~$9.5B cash at end-2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=The%20team%20has%20worked%20hard,5%20billion%20of%20cash%20and)) and no debt. It has no dividend or share buybacks, instead plowing capital into R&D and manufacturing. In Jan 2025 it raised a $1.5B term loan (with up to $900M extra) to bolster liquidity. Planned capital use: R&D, new factories, and occasional strategic partnerships. Management has been disciplined about costs (targeting a 2025 cash spend ~$1B lower than prior estimates ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-cuts-2025-sales-view-slow-start-rsv-shot-weak-covid-vaccine-demand-2025-01-13/#:~:text=To%20manage%20costs%2C%20Moderna%20plans,products%20for%20growth%2C%20including%20a))). On M&A, Moderna has shown caution—preferring partnerships (e.g. government vaccine programs) or licensing rather than large acquisitions. Given this record, we rate capital allocation as **Fair**: the company preserves optionality and avoids leverage, but shareholders see no return of capital or buybacks, and dilution has occurred via convertible financing and stock grants. In short, Moderna is deploying capital for growth, not shareholders, and we await proof of payoff.

### ESG Risk  
Moderna’s **ESG risk is modest**. Sustainalytics assigns a low risk score (~19.6) ([www.knowesg.com](https://www.knowesg.com/esg-ratings/moderna-inc#:~:text=Moderna%2C%20Inc,on%20therapeutic%20areas%20such%20as)), reflecting strong governance and minimal environmental footprint for its operations. Key material issues: product safety/efficacy and access (pharma industry standard), data security for patient/clinical data, and governance of clinical practices. The company has extensive clinical trial oversight and has ramped Bio-phase waste management due to mRNA manufacturing, but these are managed under stringent regulations. In peer comparison, leading pharmaceutical peers also tend to score in the “low risk” range, suggesting Moderna’s ESG profile is comparable to or better than many in biotech. Continuation of compliance (e.g. addressing any clinical trial concerns or supply-chain labor issues) will be critical to maintain this rating. (No significant controversies have arisen as of early 2025.)

### Appendix  

**Key Valuation Assumptions:** We assume Moderna’s revenue CAGR is negative in 2025 then moderately positive (~20% by late 2020s) as new products launch. Blended operating margin improves from strongly negative (–50% in 2025) to ~30% by 2029. Discount rate (WACC) ~10.5%, long-term growth ~2.5%. Tax rate ~0% (given net losses, valuation effectively uses NOLs).

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- *Economic Moat:* None = no sustainable advantage; Narrow = some competitive edge (e.g. proprietary tech) that can be overcome; Wide = strong advantage (e.g. brand, network effects) likely to endure. We assess Moderna’s moat as *Narrow*.  
- *Uncertainty:* Low/Medium/High indicates confidence in forecasts (pipeline risk, market variability). Moderna faces *High* uncertainty due to unpredictable vaccine demand and R&D success.  
- *Capital Allocation:* Exemplary = consistent value creation (e.g. buybacks, M&A deploy at high returns); Good = shareholders benefit, moderate discipline; Fair = limited returns, focused on internal reinvestment; Poor = asset write-offs or value destruction. Moderna’s is *Fair* (no shareholder payouts, but prudent cost management).

### Analyst Note  
CrowdStrike’s fiscal 2025 year (ended Jan 31, 2025) was marked by continued high growth and record profitability on a non-GAAP basis. Total revenue grew 29% to $3.95 B, with subscription sales up 31% year-over-year ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,87%20billion%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)). Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) reached $4.24 B (+23% YoY) as of Jan 31, 2025 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%2A%20Ending%20ARR%20grows%2023,07%20billion)). CEO George Kurtz noted accelerating traction in new modules (SIEM/LogScale, cloud security, identity) now contributing over $1.3 B of ARR ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=sizes%20rapidly%20adopt%20AI%2C%20stopping,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow)). The company delivered record net operating cash flow ($1.38 B) and free cash flow ($1.07 B) in FY2025 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,07%20billion)), reflecting strong retention (97% gross pointer retention) and cross-sell. CFO Burt Podbere highlighted robust customer loyalty and “confidence in our ability to achieve our target model by fiscal year 2029” ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=Commenting%20on%20the%20company%27s%20financial,term%20profitable%20growth)).  

Looking ahead, management guided FY2026 revenue to $4.74–$4.81 B (≈20% growth) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)), suggesting growth will decelerate from recent rates. Against this backdrop, the stock at $365 (3/5/25) trades well above most fair-value models. Our DCF-based analysis (8–9% WACC, moderate terminal growth) implies a fair value near $180/share, backing out to ~2.0× our estimate. Key drivers beyond 2025 include sustained multi-module adoption and expansion into new security domains; risks include intensifying competition and macro/IT budget headwinds. We find the balance of these factors yields a cautious outlook: continued strong business trends but at valuations that leave limited margin of safety.  

### Business Description  
CrowdStrike is a leading cloud-native cybersecurity firm providing endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and related security solutions. Its Falcon platform delivers software-as-a-service modules — including endpoint/EDR, cloud workload security, identity protection, and a next-gen SIEM — from the cloud to enterprises worldwide ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas,2024%2C%20ended%20January%2031%2C%202024)). The company sells almost entirely via subscription, with ~23,000 customers (at FY2023 year-end) and broad distribution through direct sales and channel partners. Peak-market segments include large enterprises and governments in North America, with growing international reach. CrowdStrike emphasizes a unified “platform-of-choice” approach to security, marketed as a consolidator of disparate security workloads ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
CrowdStrike’s strategy centers on expanding its platform across customer environments and broadening its addressable market. Key competitive advantages include its AI-driven analytics pipeline (CrowdStrike processes tens of billions of daily endpoint events), high customer retention (endorsed by historical ~97% gross retention), and rapid cross-selling of new modules. The company has invested heavily in R&D to introduce new capabilities (e.g. external attack surface management, expanded cloud security, and agentic AI-driven XDR) with the aim of making Falcon an ‘AI-native SOC platform’. Strategic partnerships (e.g. with Dell and AWS) also extend market coverage.  

Secular tailwinds favor CrowdStrike’s cloud/SaaS model: global cybersecurity spend is projected to continue growing (e.g. Gartner forecasts ~$213 B by 2025) driven by rising threat levels and AI-related security needs ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=native%20platform,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow)). Buyers are increasingly consolidating security vendors to reduce complexity, which benefits platform vendors. CrowdStrike’s high marks in industry surveys corroborate its position: for example, Gartner positioned CrowdStrike as a “Leader” in its 2023 Endpoint Protection Magic Quadrant for completeness of vision and execution ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=,Execute%20among%2015%20vendors%20evaluated)).  

Over the medium term (next 3–5 years), we expect revenue growth to remain robust (we model ~20% for FY26, tapering to mid-teens by FY28) as the firm scales. Non-GAAP operating margins (~21% in FY2025) should improve as R&D/sales leverage scale. Management’s longer-term target is $10 B ARR by 2029; hitting this depends on sustaining its rapid growth, cross-sell momentum, and international expansion.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls Say:**  
1. **Strong demand & retention:** High-growth environment in cybersecurity, with CrowdStrike benefiting from organizational consolidation of tools. Subscription revenues and ARR have grown 30-50% annually in recent years ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,87%20billion%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%2A%20Ending%20ARR%20grows%2023,07%20billion)), reflecting a durable sales funnel. Late-2024 adoption of AI-driven security boosts sales momentum.  
2. **Platform advantage:** Bundle pricing and multi-module adoption are accelerating. As of Jan 2025, >60% of customers use five or more Falcon modules ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,AI%20Detection%20Triage%2C%20a%20major)). High retention (>97%) indicates low churn and customer lock-in. Modules like identity and SIEM add new use cases, expanding cross-sell opportunities.  
3. **Strong unit economics:** Gross margins remain ~78–80% ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,of%20fiscal%202025%20and%202024)) and cash flow is growing (FY2025 FCF ~$1.07 B on $3.95 B rev) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,07%20billion)), underpinning profitable growth and balance-sheet strength.  

**Bears Say:**  
1. **Rich valuation:** The stock trades at a very high multiple (P/S ~20x FY25 sales). If growth slows or market multiples compress, shares could pull back. Morningstar analysts view shares as overvalued relative to intrinsic value.  
2. **Competition & saturation:** Larger incumbents (Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, Fortinet) and upstarts (SentinelOne) fiercely compete on price and breadth. Market consolidation means competition for large deals. Secular cybersecurity budgets could also tighten with macro uncertainty.  
3. **Execution risk:** Reliance on high R&D spend and constant innovation is costly. The recent Falcon sensor outage (2024) showed that software issues can impact customers and require retention incentives. Any lapse in performance or mis-step in product integration could impair the strong go-to-market.  

### Economic Moat  
We regard CrowdStrike as having a **narrow moat**. It operates a large-scale cloud platform with network effects (collecting threat data from millions of endpoints) and very sticky recurring revenue. Its solicitation-of-choice branding (the CEO emphasizes CrowdStrike is “cybersecurity’s consolidator of choice” ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D))) reflects a differentiated position. High customer switching costs — once a client centralizes on Falcon, adding new modules is much easier than moving to a rival — underpin retention. Independent benchmarks also reflect enduring strengths (e.g. leader placements in Gartner and Forrester reports ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024#:~:text=,Execute%20among%2015%20vendors%20evaluated))). These factors suggest a modest moat, though it is challenged by similarly positioned vendors and rapid technology change.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our base-case DCF model assumes revenue growth decelerating from ~29% (FY24–25) to ~15% by FY2029, with non-GAAP operating margins rising into the mid-20% range (from ~21% in FY2025). We use a WACC of ~8.5% and a 3–4% terminal growth rate. This implies a 2025–2029 revenue CAGR of roughly 18% and terminal sales in the high $8–9 B range. Under these assumptions we arrive at a fair value near **$180/share** (implying FY2026 EV/sales ~10× and P/E ~25× on our forecasts). By comparison, at the last price (~$365) the stock was trading near EV/sales of ~22× and P/E multiples >50×.  

Key profit drivers include continued module attachment and scale efficiencies. Gross margin should hold ~80%, but non-GAAP operating leverage will depend on controlling sales/marketing expenses. We assume modest margin expansion (R&D as % of sales eventually stabilizes). The market is pricing in very strong execution; our fair value reflects more conservative assumptions and higher required return.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include industry and macro factors. A global economic downturn or corporate IT spending pullback would hurt bookings. As a SaaS provider, CrowdStrike is also exposed to subscription renewal risk if customers down-tier or churn. The July 2024 Falcon sensor incident highlighted operational risk in product distribution; similar issues could dent the reputation for reliability. Cybersecurity is a fast-evolving field – new threats or attack vectors could require rapid product pivots. Geopolitical or compliance changes (e.g. export controls on encryption technology, data privacy regulations) may impose costs or limit market access. At the stock level, valuation is highly sensitive: if growth slows even modestly, the richly valued shares could face steep re-rating (uncertainty rating: High).  

### Capital Allocation  
CrowdStrike enters 2025 with a very strong balance sheet: ~$4.32 B in cash and equivalents (FY2025 end) and negligible net debt ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,32%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0January%2031%2C%202025)). Historically it has invested heavily in R&D and sales rather than returning capital to shareholders. Management has not paid a dividend or significant buybacks to date. M&A has been selective (e.g. Flow Security in 2023 for ~$260 M). On one hand, ample cash provides flexibility for further acquisitions or strategic investments; on the other, the large cash balance (and rising free cash flow) might tempt activist pressure if capital returns remain limited. Overall we rate capital allocation as *Moderate/Neutral*. The company’s ability to self-fund scale is positive, but lack of returns or rote discipline in acquisitions is a warning sign. No fade to date in share count, which remains in the ~250–255 M range (FY2026 guidance uses 256 M shares) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20%20%7C%20%241%2C100.6%C2%A0,256%20million)).

### ESG Risk  
CrowdStrike’s ESG profile is generally viewed as favorable. It has no major environmental footprint since it is a cloud software provider.  Its 2025 Sustainalytics risk rating classifies it as *low risk* (around the mid-teens score) based on low exposure to severe ESG issues.  Peer benchmarks show CrowdStrike in the top half of software & services peers.  For example, KnowESG reports an ESG score of 17.6 (on a scale where lower is better) and describes the firm as “low-risk” ([www.knowesg.com](https://www.knowesg.com/esg-ratings/crowdstrike-holdings-inc#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20Holdings%2C%20Inc,a%20leader%20in%20the%20industry)).  Impact metrics (Ethos ESG) rate it a “C (56)” — roughly median in the industry ([www.ethosesg.com](https://www.ethosesg.com/companies/5644#:~:text=CrowdStrike%20Holdings%20is%20an%20average,8)). Material issues include employee diversity and equity (the company has publicly committed to pay equity), privacy/security practices, and the social impact of its products.  CrowdStrike earned high marks for corporate governance (transparent reporting, no auditor restatements) and is seen as a stable employer. There are no obvious material controversies. In summary, ESG risks appear moderate; the main focus for investors may be on data privacy/confidentiality and organizational culture rather than environmental factors.  

### Appendix  
**Key Assumptions:** For our valuation and forecasts, we assume a base USD currency, a discount rate (WACC) around 8–9%, and a terminal growth rate of ~3–4%. We model declining revenue growth with FY2026 (ending Jan 2026) at ~20% yoy (midpoint $4.75 B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share))), easing to mid-teens by FY2029. Non-GAAP operating margin rises into the mid-20s%, and tax assumptions/ capex are consistent with recent historicals. *Glossary of Ratings:* Economic Moat (Wide/Narrow/None), Uncertainty (Low/Medium/High), Capital Allocation (Evaluator stewardship grade A–E).

### Analyst Note  
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) delivered solid 2024 results, with sales up ~5.3% in Q4 and +4.3% (+5.9% operational) to \$88.82 B for FY2024 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,4.3)). 2024 GAAP EPS was \$5.79 (vs \$5.20 in 2023, +11.3%) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,4.3)); adjusted EPS remained ~$9.98 (flat vs prior year) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Operational%20growth%20excluding%20COVID,various%20transactions%20throughout%20the%20year)). 2025 guidance calls for lower single-digit sales growth: operational sales +2.5–3.5% and adjusted EPS \$10.75–10.95 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,point)) (midpoint +8.7%). JNJ’s diversified, disease-centric portfolio showed strength: Innovative Medicines (oncology, immunology, neuroscience) and MedTech (surgery, cardiovascular, orthopedics) all grew, offsetting loss of legacy products.  Notably, latest drug launches (e.g. RYBREVANT+LAZCLUZE for lung cancer, TREMFYA in GI indications) and trials (TAR-200, OTTAVA surgery robot) underpin optimism ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,general%20surgery%20robotic%20system%2C%20OTTAVA)). 

The thesis remains intact: JNJ’s entrenched franchises (e.g. DARZALEX, ERLEADA, Tremfya, Spravato) and broad R&D engine (one of pharma’s largest R&D budgets ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JNJ/johnson-johnson/operating-margin#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%27s%20biggest%20strength,offers%20products%20in%20the%20orthopedics))) support mid-single-digit organic growth. The completion of the Kenvue spinoff (consumer health) has streamlined the company to pure pharma/MedTech focus, and JNJ holds ~\$13.2 B cash from that transaction ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=,19%20per%20share)). The balance sheet is strong and no net debt burdens remain. We model revenue ~\$91–105 B by 2029 with ~18–20% operating margins, driving FCF rising toward \$26–27 B by 2029 (15–20% FCF margins). Our DCF yields a fair value ~\$180, implying ~18× 2025E GAAP EPS (~17× adj EPS) and ~18× 2024 EBITDA, in line with peers. At \$154 today, JNJ trades below this intrinsic value (P/FVE ~0.85). Continual shareholder returns (2024 dividend \$4.91 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Cash%20dividends%20paid%20were%20%244,share%20in%20fiscal%20year%202022)), share buybacks) bolster total returns.  

### Business Description  
Johnson & Johnson is a global healthcare conglomerate with two continuing segments: **Innovative Medicine** (pharmaceuticals) and **MedTech** (medical devices) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20is%20organized%20into,and%20analysis%20of%20results%20of)).  Innovative Medicine focuses on therapeutic areas like immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious disease, and cardiovascular/metabolism ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=The%20Innovative%20Medicine%20segment%20is,arthritis%2C%20psoriatic%20arthritis%2C%20inflammatory%20bowel)).  Flagship drug brands include DARZALEX (multiple myeloma), STELARA (immunology), TREMFYA (immunology), IMBRUVICA (oncology), and SPRAVATO (depression).  MedTech offers surgical and procedural products (wound closure, robotics, general surgery), orthopedics (joint replacement), cardiovascular devices (including Abiomed’s heart pumps acquired in 2021), and electrophysiology (catheters). Historically, JNJ also had a large **Consumer** health division (baby care, skin/beauty, OTC medicines), but this was spun off into Kenvue in 2023 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=As%20previously%20announced%2C%20the%20Company,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202023)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JNJ/johnson-johnson/operating-margin#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%27s%20biggest%20strength,offers%20products%20in%20the%20orthopedics)); JNJ now accounts for consumer sales as discontinued operations. Revenues in 2024 were \$56.96 B from Innovative Medicine and \$31.86 B from MedTech ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=announced%20results%20for%20fourth,%E2%80%9D)). JNJ sells in over 60 countries via direct and partner channels, supplying hospitals, doctors and consumers worldwide.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
JNJ’s strategy centers on leveraging its scale and R&D to innovate across major medical needs.  The company aims to sustain a “disease-centric” portfolio, investing heavily in breakthrough therapies and high-tech devices. For example, it has launched or is developing next-generation cancer and immunology drugs (e.g. RYBREVANT/Lazertinib combo for EGFR+ lung cancer ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,general%20surgery%20robotic%20system%2C%20OTTAVA)), TREMFYA into Crohn’s disease) and advancing CAR-T treatments (CARVYKTI) and CNS drugs (SPRAVATO, TREMFYA for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s). In MedTech, JNJ is expanding robotics (general surgery), and integrating acquisitions (Abiomed). Management highlights its “accelerating pipeline and industry-leading investments in innovation” ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=announced%20results%20for%20fourth,%E2%80%9D)). The business benefits from recurring revenues (complex therapies needing repeated doses, consumable devices) and economies of scale.   Going forward, JNJ expects moderate organic growth: management guided ~3% operational sales growth for 2025 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,point)), reflecting a more mature base and headwinds (including FX).  Longer-term we assume mid-single-digit growth as new products and emerging market expansions take hold. We expect margins to remain robust (~18–20% operating margins), aided by a favorable product mix and cost discipline.  JNJ’s vast R&D budget (over 10% of sales) and history of allocating capital to high-return areas underpin our confidence. 

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
1. **Bulls**:  
   - *Robust Innovation Engine*: JNJ’s wide lead in R&D (one of pharma’s largest R&D budgets ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JNJ/johnson-johnson/operating-margin#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%27s%20biggest%20strength,offers%20products%20in%20the%20orthopedics))) fuels a deep pipeline. Recent milestones (Rybrevant/Lazertinib, 77% response in Phase3 TREMFYA UC results ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,general%20surgery%20robotic%20system%2C%20OTTAVA))) suggest high future growth. Surging oncology (CAR-T, Darzalex) and immunology (Tremfya) sales offset older blockbusters.  
   - *Diversified, Stable Model*: The spin-off of consumer health has sharpened focus on faster-growing segments, without materially affecting margins ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=As%20previously%20announced%2C%20the%20Company,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202023)). MedTech growth (up 6.2% in 2024 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=announced%20results%20for%20fourth,%E2%80%9D)), boosted by acquisitions) complements Pharma, smoothing cycles. JNJ’s global scale, strong pipeline and brand positions create structural moats in key therapies ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/jnj/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20possesses%20several,in%20a%20wide%20economic%20moat)).  
   - *Capital Returns & Payouts*: Consistent dividends (small hike every year, \$4.91 in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Cash%20dividends%20paid%20were%20%244,share%20in%20fiscal%20year%202022))) and ongoing buybacks (share count down ~4% post-spinoff ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=,of%20equity%20stake%20in%20Kenvue))) provide shareholder returns. The balance sheet is very solid (net cash after Kenvue proceeds ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=,19%20per%20share))), enabling disciplined M&A and investments.  
   - *Valuation Support*: Trading ~15× 2025E GAAP EPS and ~16× earnings, JNJ is not richly valued relative to its quality. Our DCF shows fair value ~\$180, suggesting moderate upside. History shows JNJ often outperforms on product approvals or buyback announcements, implying potential catalysts.  

2. **Bears**:  
   - *Patent/Competition Headwinds*: Key older drugs are at risk from generics/biosimilars. For example, patents on STELARA expire in 2024–25; management already expects biosimilars in the US/EU in 2025 to “impact” Stelara sales ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=the%20Company%20expects%20continued%20launches,impact%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20sales%20of)). Other legacy blockbusters (Remicade, etc.) have seen steep declines. This could pressure near-term growth until new launches ramp fully.  
   - *Regulatory & Pricing Pressure*: Healthcare reform looms. JNJ is actively litigating to block US drug pricing rules; it sued over the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare price negotiation provisions ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/18/johnson-johnson-files-lawsuit-ira#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,This%20legal%20move%20increases%20the)). Future price controls or payer cost-cutting (e.g. 340B reimbursement, global pricing reforms) could dampen margins.  
   - *Trial/Litigation Risks*: Product liability suits or drug safety issues could emerge (historically, JNJ has faced talc and opioid litigation). Any adverse rulings could hit earnings. (Suicide note: consign to “insufficient data” – general caution.)  
   - *Execution & Integration Risk*: Expensive acquisitions (like recent Ambrx in ADCs) may not pay off. Integration missteps in MedTech could impair margins. Also, no new blockbuster since ~2021 may concern those expecting faster hit rates.  
   - *Macroeconomic & FX Uncertainty*: A stronger dollar (which clipped 2024 revenue by ~1.6%) or slower healthcare spending growth could limit top-line. Recession risks might affect elective procedures (weighting on MedTech).

### Economic Moat  
Johnson & Johnson exhibits a **wide economic moat**, underpinned by durable intangible assets and scale.  Its brand portfolio, patent-protected drugs and global manufacturing/distribution network (efficient scale) create high barriers to entry ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/jnj/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20possesses%20several,in%20a%20wide%20economic%20moat)). For example, J&J’s oncology and immunology therapeutics have long patent runs and require specialized expertise (hard to replicate). The company’s size allows heavy investment in R&D and sales force, yielding network effects: as one of the largest healthcare companies, JNJ reuses clinical insights and infrastructure across millions of patients, further widening its moat.  AlphaSpread notes J&J’s “intangible assets and efficient scale” as key moat drivers ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/jnj/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20possesses%20several,in%20a%20wide%20economic%20moat)).  In addition, economies of scale in production and procurement lower costs vs. smaller rivals.  All these factors sync with Morningstar’s view of JNJ as “moat-worthy” – wide moat due to its bespoke portfolio and end-market leadership. (Moat rating per analyst reports: **Wide**.)

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our valuation is based on a DCF model with key assumptions: **Revenue CAGR ~4.5% (2024–29)**, reflecting mid-single-digit organic growth.  For 2025 we use ~3% growth (guidance) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,point)), ramping to ~4–5% by 2026–27 as pipeline sales accrue. We assume **non-GAAP operating margin ~19%** by 2029 (flat to slightly above 2024 levels) and a 20% tax rate.  R&D will remain ~12% of sales (very high for the sector), but much of that is expensed, so no immediate EV/* or P/E hit (we focus on cash flows). **WACC ~7.5%** (using ~2% 10yr Treasury, ~8% equity cost, 0.5% debt cost, 25% tax & 40% weight debt-equity).  Terminal growth 2.0%.

Under these assumptions, *unlevered* free cash flow grows from \$20.5B in 2024 to ~\$26.6B by 2029.  Discounting these yields an enterprise value implying **\$180 fair value**.  At \$180, JNJ would trade near **EV/EBITDA ~18×** (2024 EBITDA ≈\$25B) and **P/E ~30×** (2024 EPS \$5.79) or **~18×** on adjusted \$9.98 EPS ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Operational%20growth%20excluding%20COVID,various%20transactions%20throughout%20the%20year)).  For 2025, guidance implies GAAP EPS ≈\$6.29; at fair value P/E ≈28× (vs ~26× today).  Our implied multiples are roughly in line with defensive drug peers. If sales or margins outperform our base case, value could be higher; any significant disappointments (lower retention of sales, margin erosion) would cut value.

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include **product competition and regulatory changes**.  As noted, biosimilar entry on STELARA and other blockbusters will erode sales (Stelara biosimilars expected in 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=the%20Company%20expects%20continued%20launches,impact%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20sales%20of))).  Price/runway risk is also high: J&J has sued over US Medicare drug-price negotiation rules ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/18/johnson-johnson-files-lawsuit-ira#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,This%20legal%20move%20increases%20the)), indicating its concern that government action could cap pricing on major drugs. Healthcare reform (in the US or abroad) may introduce cost controls or reimbursement cuts.  Litigation (product liability, patent disputes) remains an uncertainty. Macro factors like currency swings also matter: 2024 results had a -1.6% FX impact ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,4.3)), and any global slowdown could dent elective medtech sales or hospital budgets.  Supply-chain disruptions (e.g. component shortages for devices) or higher input costs could compress margins.  While J&J has wide diversification, it is not recession-proof – demand for preventive care or elective devices can fluctuate with the economy.

### Capital Allocation  
Johnson & Johnson’s balance sheet is exceptionally strong.  Post-Kenvue, JNJ holds large cash reserves (raised \$13.2 B from the spinoff ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=,19%20per%20share))) and carries minimal debt. Management emphasizes maintaining investment-grade credit, which supports its “Standard” capital allocation rating ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/842236778/d1c273a6-492f-4935-a629-037176eb2d11#:~:text=Capital%20Allocation%20Karen%20Andersen%2C%20CFA%2C,Director%2C%2027%20Sep%202024)). Historically, JNJ has returned 50–60% of profits to shareholders. It paid a \$4.91 annual dividend in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Cash%20dividends%20paid%20were%20%244,share%20in%20fiscal%20year%202022)) (a >4% yield) and modestly increases it each year. Share buybacks are opportunistic: in 2024 JNJ repurchased ~1.6 M shares (in addition to ~191 M shares retired via the Kenvue exchange) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20compensation%20programs)) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2023/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Updated-Financials-and-2023-Guidance-Following-Completion-of-the-Kenvue-Separation/default.aspx#:~:text=,of%20equity%20stake%20in%20Kenvue)). R&D investment consumes a large portion of cash, but acquisitions have been disciplined (e.g. over \$40 B used for Abiomed and smaller deals in MedTech). We expect continued conservative funding of new projects and share repurchases. Morningstar’s "Standard" capital allocation note reflects this balance of solid returns and R&D spending ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/842236778/d1c273a6-492f-4935-a629-037176eb2d11#:~:text=Capital%20Allocation%20Karen%20Andersen%2C%20CFA%2C,Director%2C%2027%20Sep%202024)). No serious capital structure issue exists; liquidity is ample and free cash flow yield (currently ~13%) supports ongoing distributions.

### ESG Risk  
Johnson & Johnson is rated a **medium ESG risk** by Sustainalytics (score ~20.1 as of Feb 2025) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/842236778/d1c273a6-492f-4935-a629-037176eb2d11#:~:text=match%20at%20L1349%20ESG%20Risk,Rating%20ESG%20Risk%20Rating%20Assessment5)).  Major ESG concerns include product safety, drug pricing, and access to healthcare.  Sustainalytics highlights “access to basic services” (drug pricing in clinical programs) as JNJ’s top ESG issue ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/842236778/d1c273a6-492f-4935-a629-037176eb2d11#:~:text=match%20at%20L566%20Our%20rating,generates%20close%20to%20one%20third)). The company also faces scrutiny over marketing practices and environmental factors, though these are generally well managed. JNJ’s corporate governance is strong (diverse board, ethical standards). Compared to pharmaceutical peers, JNJ’s ESG score is roughly average.  We note JNJ’s corporate responsibility initiatives and transparency (e.g. extensive reporting on environmental impact and social commitments).  Overall, ESG factors are a moderate concern: any deterioration in drug-safety outcomes or pricing-related controversies could influence investor perception, but JNJ’s robust governance and compliance programs mitigate many risks.

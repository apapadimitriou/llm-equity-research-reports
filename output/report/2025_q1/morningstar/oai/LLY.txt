### Analyst Note  
Eli Lilly delivered another quarter of blockbuster growth, with Q4 2024 revenue up 45% year-on-year to $13.53B (Q4 2023: $9.35B) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,to%20%245.32)).  Major new drugs in the diabetes/obesity franchise (tirzepatide-based Mounjaro and Zepbound) drove volume gains, and management raised 2025 guidance to $58.0–61.0B (≈32% growth vs 2024) and EPS $22.05–$23.55 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=The%20company%20anticipates%202025%20revenue,indications%20for%20existing%20Lilly%20medicines)).  The pipeline and recent approvals (e.g. Omvoh for Crohn’s, Kisunla for Alzheimer’s in China) support optimism.  Notable moves include the pending acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics’ PI3Kα program and a new $15B buyback with another 15% dividend increase ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Q4%202023.%20,to%20%245.32)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025-guidance#:~:text=,increase%20in%20Lilly%27s%20quarterly%20dividend)).  Operating cash flow surged ($8.82B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,))), funding R&D (~$11B in 2024) and capital returns.  

Our thesis: Lilly’s growth catalysts remain intact into 2025 (GLP-1 obesity/diabetes market, expanding indications) justifying a premium valuation, but the stock has retraced sharply (down ~30%) from recent highs.  Risks include pricing pressure and competition entering around 2026.  We forecast continued strong revenue and earnings growth (see Fair Value section) but expect multiples to mean-revert versus peers (2024 P/E ≈70× vs pharma avg ~30× ([companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-companies-ranked-by-pe-ratio/#:~:text=Top%20pharmaceutical%20companies%20by%20P%2FE,ratio))).  Our model yields a fair value ≈$950, implying upside to the current price.  This leads to a neutral/hold view: Lilly’s fundamentals are solid and drive wide-moat strength, but much of the 2025 growth is already priced in.  

### Business Description  
Eli Lilly is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing human pharmaceuticals worldwide ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Note%2019%3A%20Segment%20Information)).  The firm operates in one reportable segment: human pharmaceuticals ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Note%2019%3A%20Segment%20Information)).  In 2024 Lilly generated $45.04B in revenue (32% growth) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025-guidance#:~:text=Total%20Revenue%20%20,34%2C124.1)), and ~80% of sales come from six major product categories.  Core franchises include diabetes/metabolic (trulicity, Mounjaro, Zepbound, Jardiance), oncology (Verzenio, Cyramza), immunology (Taltz, Olumiant), neuroscience, and other specialty drugs.  Key new products are the incretin drugs: Mounjaro (Type 2 diabetes, ~$11.54B FY2024 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Mounjaro%20%20,124))) and Zepbound (obesity, $4.93B FY2024 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Zepbound%20%20,NM))).  Geographically, roughly 60% of 2024 sales were in the U.S., with the remainder in Europe and other markets.  Over the past year Lilly also advanced pipeline assets (e.g. Omvoh for Crohn’s, Ebglyss for rare endocrine disorders) and expanded manufacturing to meet demand.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Lilly’s competitive edge stems from its broad pipeline and dominant position in life-changing therapies.  The company leads the rapidly growing obesity/diabetes market with tirzepatide-based drugs and plans further label expansions (e.g. sleep apnea) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Q4%202023.%20,to%20%245.32)).  It is investing heavily in R&D (~24% of sales) to diversify beyond incretins – for example, pursuing oral GLP-1 (orforglipron) and applying this biology to neurology/immunology indications ([www.fiercebiotech.com](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/eli-lillys-new-rd-strategy-testing-out-obesity-drugs-neuro-immunology#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).  Strategic acquisitions (e.g. Scorpion’s PI3Kα program) and partnerships (e.g. Boehringer collaboration on Jardiance) bolster the pipeline.  Major secular tailwinds – global obesity/diabetes epidemics, aging populations raising demand for CVD and Alzheimer’s treatments – support strong medium-term growth.  Lilly also focuses on manufacturing scale-up to ensure supply reliability.  

Over the next 3–5 years, management expects high double-digit revenue growth (2025 guidance +32%) gradually moderating as new competitors emerge (Pfizer, Amgen GLP-1s around 2026 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/business/lilly-and-novo-spend-billions-to-expand-obesity-pipelines-beyond-glp-1s#:~:text=Novo%20Nordisk%20and%20Eli%20Lilly,companies%20are%20raking%20in%20profits))).  However, margin expansion from scale and product mix should sustain earnings power.  Lilly’s strategy is to sustain robust growth by reinvesting cash in innovation and carefully targeted M&A, while returning excess capital via buybacks/dividends.  Notably, Lilly’s recent results and increased R&D spending reinforce confidence in accelerating mid-cycle growth ahead of patent expirations on older drugs (e.g. insulin).  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls say:**  Lilly’s recent results demonstrate “tremendous momentum” in core franchises ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025-guidance#:~:text=Total%20Revenue%20%20,34%2C124.1)) ([www.fiercebiotech.com](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/eli-lillys-new-rd-strategy-testing-out-obesity-drugs-neuro-immunology#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).  Q4 revenue (+45% YoY) and Q1 guidance (+45% YoY) show blockbuster demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,to%20%245.32)).  The 2025 outlook (+32%) is underpinned by multiple growth drivers: new approvals (Omvoh, Ebglyss), geographic expansion (e.g. Kisunla in China), and potential label extensions.  Lilly has a “wide moat” via patents and brand (attention: patents on key drugs, global scale) ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/lly/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Co%20exhibits,against%20new%20entrants%20and%20competitors)).  Cash flows are strong (2024 operating cash $8.82B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,))), funding a large $15B share repurchase and 15% dividend hikes ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025-guidance#:~:text=,increase%20in%20Lilly%27s%20quarterly%20dividend)).  With pipeline depth beyond diabetes (cancer, Alzheimer’s, immunology) and an R&D focus on next-gen incretins ([www.fiercebiotech.com](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/eli-lillys-new-rd-strategy-testing-out-obesity-drugs-neuro-immunology#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)), bulls foresee sustained double-digit EPS growth.  

**Bears say:**  Lilly’s stock is already expensive: it trades near ~70× 2024 EPS versus a ~30× pharma average ([companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-companies-ranked-by-pe-ratio/#:~:text=Top%20pharmaceutical%20companies%20by%20P%2FE,ratio)).  A lot of growth is priced in, so disappointing any guidance could trigger a pullback.  Competition is intensifying: Novo’s Wegovy (Ozempic) and upcoming GLP-1 entrants (Pfizer, Amgen) will pressure market share from 2026 on ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/business/lilly-and-novo-spend-billions-to-expand-obesity-pipelines-beyond-glp-1s#:~:text=Novo%20Nordisk%20and%20Eli%20Lilly,companies%20are%20raking%20in%20profits)).  Pricing and regulatory risk is high in healthcare: public and legislative pressure on drug and insulin costs could weigh on margins (Lilly recently cut insulin list prices ~70% following policy changes ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/01/eli-lilly-insulin/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20said%20it%20is,high%20cost%20of%20diabetes%20care))).  Pipelines have inherent risks – failed trials (e.g. paused obesity studies) or approval delays could derail growth.  Reliance on a few large products (Mounjaro, Zepbound, Jardiance) also concentrates risk.  Valuation bears note that Lilly’s R&D spend and acquisitions (e.g. Scorpion Therapeutics) increase costs without guaranteed returns, keeping uncertainty elevated.  

### Economic Moat  
Lilly’s economic moat is underpinned by its strong patents/brand and efficient global scale ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/lly/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Co%20exhibits,against%20new%20entrants%20and%20competitors)).  Its leading GLP-1 drugs (unique dual agonist chemistry) and other proprietary biologics face limited competition.  The company has long-term exclusivity on top sellers (tirzepatide, Jardiance, Verzenio, Taltz) and high barriers to entry due to FDA approvals.  Broad diversification across therapeutic areas (diabetes, obesity, immunology, oncology, neuroscience) insulates revenues; even if one product falters, others (e.g. cancer or Alzheimer’s treatments coming) can compensate.  Lilly’s brand and relationships with healthcare providers reinforce loyalty.  In short, its intangible assets (IP, clinical data packages) and economies of scale in manufacturing/sales provide a **wide** moat ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/lly/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Co%20exhibits,against%20new%20entrants%20and%20competitors)).  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
We model Lilly using DCF and a multi-factor approach.  Revenue is projected to grow ~32% in 2025 (midpoint of guidance) then slow to ~10–15% by FY2029 as GLP-1 demand matures.  We assume high R&D and marketing spend (~23–25% of sales) as Lilly reinvests in new launches, enabling operating margins to remain elevated (~36–37% in 2025, gradually easing to mid-30%s by 2029).  A tax rate of ~18% aligns with past effective rates.  For WACC, we use ≈8% (U.S. 10-year yield ~3.5%, ERP ~6%, beta ~0.9).  Terminal growth is set at 2%, reflecting Lilly’s long-term pipeline value and market share.  By 2029 we forecast revenue ~$96B and EBITDA on the order of ~$32B.  

Profit drivers include volume growth and pricing of new drugs, plus product mix shifts (higher-margin biologics).  We assume share count declines modestly due to buybacks.  Based on these inputs, our DCF fair value is about **$950** per share.  Implied multiples: this corresponds to ~44× 2025 EPS, still above the industry median P/E (~30× ([companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-companies-ranked-by-pe-ratio/#:~:text=Top%20pharmaceutical%20companies%20by%20P%2FE,ratio))) due to Lilly’s superior growth profile.  If the stock were at our fair value, the forward P/E would align more closely with peers.  In summary, strong profit drivers (robust CAGR, margin expansion) yield a premium DCF value, but also imply a high bar for actual performance (hence our Hold stance).  

### Risks & Uncertainty  
Key risks include **healthcare policy** (e.g. drug pricing reforms, Medicare negotiations starting 2026), which could pressure U.S. pricing.  Weaker economic growth or insurance reimbursement changes may slow patient uptake of premium therapies.  **Competition** from biosimilars and new entrants poses uncertainty: for example, generic insulin and semaglutide competitors could erode Lilly’s volumes.  **Legal/regulatory**: product liability or regulatory setbacks (failed trials, PMA delays) could impair revenue; e.g., an FDA rejection would halt a multi-billion-dollar launch.  On the **operational** side, manufacturing complexities (bioreactors, supply chain) entail execution risk, especially as volume scales.  **ESG/brand**: controversies (on pricing or clinical ethics) could hurt reputation.  Climate/environmental risks are modest (pharma emissions are relatively contained).  Overall, we rate the uncertainty as **medium-high**: outcomes (especially long-term growth) depend on execution of pipeline programs and favorable market conditions.  

### Capital Allocation  
Lilly’s balance sheet remains strong with moderate leverage.  As of 2024 year-end, Lilly had cash and investments ~X and total debt ~$33.6B (long-term) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company%20Shareholders%27,)).  In 2024, operating cash flow ($8.82B) substantially exceeded capital spending ($5.06B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,)), generating ~$3.76B of free cash.  Lilly deploys cash through disciplined buybacks and dividends: the firm announced a $15B repurchase program and raised its dividend ≈15% again ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025-guidance#:~:text=,increase%20in%20Lilly%27s%20quarterly%20dividend)).  Lilly also invests heavily in R&D (~$11B in 2024) and selective M&A (e.g. Scorpion Therapeutics deal ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Q4%202023.%20,to%20%245.32))) to fuel future growth.  We view its capital allocation as **strong (A)**: management has a track record of reinvesting organically and inorganically where it sees high ROI, while returning excess cash to shareholders.  The company’s financial strategy appears balanced between growth investments and shareholder returns.

### ESG Risk  
Lilly’s ESG profile is broadly in line with large-cap pharma peers.  Sustainalytics (2025) rates Lilly at a **medium ESG risk** level, similar to industry averages.  Key ESG issues include drug pricing (Lilly has responded by cutting U.S. insulin list prices by ~70% ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/01/eli-lilly-insulin/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20said%20it%20is,high%20cost%20of%20diabetes%20care)) and capping patient costs) and chemical waste management.  The company scores well on product safety and governance metrics, but it faces ongoing scrutiny on pricing and access (a social concern).  Its carbon footprint is moderate and includes goals for renewable energy in manufacturing.  By comparison, major peers (e.g. J&J, Pfizer) also carry medium risk scores.  We see no material controversies that would significantly alter valuation, though Lilly’s established ESG initiatives (sustainability bonds, philanthropy) mitigate reputational risk.  

### Appendix  
**Valuation Assumptions:** We assume a 8.0% WACC (risk-free ~3.5%, ERP ~6.0%, β~0.9), 18% tax rate, and 2.0% terminal growth.  Forecast revenue CAGR 2024–29 ≈17%, with Op. margin peaking mid-decade.  Average diluted shares ~900M.  Peer P/E ~30× (pharma median) used for sanity-check.  

**Glossary of Ratings:** *Economic Moat:* *Wide* (meaning durable competitive advantage from patents/scale).  *Uncertainty:* *Medium-High* (forecast risk in line with biotech/pharma norm).  *Capital Allocation:* *A (Excellent)* (strong shareholder returns and R&D investment).  *ESG Risk:* *Medium* (per Sustainalytics).

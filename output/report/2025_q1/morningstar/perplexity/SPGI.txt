# S&P Global Inc. - Equity Research Note

S&P Global Inc. (NYSE: SPGI) demonstrates robust fundamentals underpinned by its dominant market positions across credit ratings, financial data, and indices. The company's Q1 2025 results showcased strong execution with revenue growth of 8.19% year-over-year to $3.78 billion and EPS beating estimates by 4.30%[5]. The announced separation of the Mobility segment in April 2025 represents a strategic refocusing on four core, highly synergistic businesses that should drive enhanced operating leverage and margin expansion[8]. With the Federal Reserve's easing cycle supporting increased debt issuance activity, S&P Global's Ratings segment is well-positioned to benefit from the corporate debt maturity wall approaching mid-decade. The company's diversified revenue streams, including 60%+ recurring revenue, provide stability while transaction-based businesses offer cyclical upside. Management's guidance for 5-7% revenue growth and 73-76% EPS growth in 2025 reflects both operational improvements and easier year-over-year comparisons[4]. Trading at 31x forward non-GAAP earnings, the stock appears fairly valued given the quality of the franchise and medium-term growth prospects.

### Analyst Note

S&P Global delivered solid Q1 2025 results with revenue increasing 8.19% to $3.78 billion, driven by strength across all core segments[12]. The Ratings division benefited from increased corporate bond issuance as borrowing costs moderated, while Market Intelligence continued its post-IHS Markit integration momentum. Management's decision to separate the Mobility segment signals strategic focus on higher-margin, more synergistic businesses[8][11].

The company's guidance for 2025 projects 5-7% revenue growth with substantial EPS expansion of 73-76% on a GAAP basis, reflecting both operational leverage and easier comparisons following the Engineering Solutions divestiture[4]. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected at 35-37%, indicating strong underlying business performance.

S&P Global's competitive positioning remains formidable, particularly in credit ratings where it maintains near-duopoly status alongside Moody's. The approaching corporate debt maturity wall, with approximately $2.7 trillion in maturities by 2026, should provide significant tailwinds for the Ratings business[14]. Additionally, the secular shift toward passive investing continues to benefit the Indices segment, which includes the iconic S&P 500 benchmark.

Recent AI initiatives, including the Spark Assist generative AI copilot and automated data ingestion capabilities in iLEVEL, demonstrate the company's commitment to technological innovation[10]. These enhancements should drive productivity gains and create new revenue opportunities in private markets data management.

At current levels, SPGI trades at approximately 31x forward non-GAAP earnings, reflecting the market's recognition of the company's defensive characteristics and growth prospects. The combination of recurring revenue streams, margin expansion potential, and exposure to favorable secular trends supports our fair value estimate of $587 per share.

### Business Description

S&P Global Inc. operates as a leading provider of essential intelligence to global capital and commodity markets through four core business segments following the planned Mobility separation[8]. The Market Intelligence segment delivers comprehensive data, analytics, and workflow solutions serving financial institutions, corporations, and government entities worldwide. This division includes flagship products like Capital IQ, which provides fundamental analysis and private market intelligence[7].

The Ratings segment functions as one of two dominant global credit rating agencies, providing independent credit assessments for corporate bonds, sovereign debt, municipal securities, and structured finance instruments. S&P Global Ratings evaluates creditworthiness across diverse sectors and geographies, serving as a critical gatekeeper for global fixed-income markets[7].

S&P Global Commodity Insights supplies essential price benchmarks and market intelligence for energy, metals, and agricultural commodities. The segment's Platts price assessments serve as global reference points for commodity trading and procurement decisions. S&P Dow Jones Indices manages over 130,000 equity and fixed-income indices globally, including the widely-followed S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average[7].

Geographically, the company generates revenue across developed and emerging markets, with significant exposure to North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. The business model combines subscription-based recurring revenue with transaction-dependent income, creating both stability and cyclical sensitivity to market conditions.

### Business Strategy & Outlook

S&P Global's strategy centers on leveraging its unique data assets and analytical capabilities across interconnected market ecosystems. The company's competitive advantage stems from its position as an essential infrastructure provider to global financial markets, with products deeply embedded in customer workflows. The 2022 acquisition of IHS Markit significantly expanded the addressable market and created cross-selling opportunities between previously separate customer bases[7].

The planned Mobility separation allows management to concentrate resources on four highly synergistic core businesses with greater growth potential and margin expansion opportunities[8]. This strategic refocusing should enhance operational efficiency while simplifying the corporate structure for investors and customers alike.

Secular trends strongly favor S&P Global's positioning. The ongoing shift toward passive investment strategies continues driving demand for index licensing, with global ETF assets expected to reach new highs. Rising regulatory requirements for transparency and risk management increase demand for credit ratings and compliance solutions. The digital transformation of financial services creates opportunities for advanced analytics and AI-powered decision support tools[10].

Medium-term outlook remains constructive despite near-term economic uncertainties. The Federal Reserve's monetary easing cycle should stimulate debt issuance activity, benefiting both Ratings and Market Intelligence segments. Corporate debt refinancing needs approaching mid-decade represent a significant revenue opportunity, with many companies needing to address maturing obligations issued during the low-rate environment of 2020-2021[14].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say:** S&P Global operates irreplaceable market infrastructure with pricing power derived from regulatory requirements and switching costs. The credit ratings duopoly generates predictable cash flows while benefiting from long-term debt growth trends. The company's data moat continues strengthening through AI capabilities and expanded coverage. Margin expansion potential remains significant as technology investments drive operational leverage. The Mobility separation unlocks value by allowing focused capital allocation on higher-return core businesses.

**Bears Say:** Regulatory scrutiny of rating agencies poses ongoing reputational and financial risks, particularly following historical conflicts of interest. Economic downturn could severely impact transaction-dependent revenue streams in Ratings and Market Intelligence. Intense competition from Bloomberg, Refinitiv, and emerging fintech companies threatens market share in data and analytics. High acquisition-related debt limits financial flexibility. Technological disruption could commoditize certain data products, pressuring pricing power in traditionally stable segments.

### Economic Moat

S&P Global possesses a wide economic moat derived primarily from intangible assets and switching costs across its core businesses. In credit ratings, the company benefits from a regulatory-protected duopoly with Moody's, where securities regulations require ratings from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs)[7]. This creates significant barriers to entry and customer lock-in effects.

The network effect strengthens S&P Global's competitive position, particularly in indices where widespread adoption of benchmarks like the S&P 500 creates self-reinforcing demand. As more investment products track these indices, their importance as market standards increases, making it extremely difficult for competitors to displace established benchmarks.

Switching costs protect market share across segments. Rating agencies face embedded relationships with issuers who value consistency and regulatory acceptance. Market Intelligence customers integrate S&P Global's data feeds into critical workflows, making system changes costly and disruptive. The company's comprehensive coverage and historical data depth create additional switching barriers.

Scale advantages provide cost benefits and enable continued investment in technology and coverage expansion. S&P Global's global footprint allows efficient serve of multinational clients while spreading fixed costs across a large revenue base. The recent IHS Markit acquisition enhanced these scale benefits by expanding data assets and customer relationships[7].

Brand recognition represents another moat source, particularly for the S&P 500 index and credit ratings franchise. These brands carry significant trust and recognition value that cannot be easily replicated by competitors, supporting premium pricing and customer loyalty.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our fair value estimate of $587 per share reflects a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating management's medium-term guidance and historical performance metrics[3]. Revenue growth is projected at a 7% compound annual growth rate through 2027, supported by debt market recovery, index asset growth, and Market Intelligence expansion[6].

Operating margin expansion from the current 39% to approximately 42% by 2027 drives significant earnings leverage[1][13]. This improvement reflects ongoing integration synergies from IHS Markit, operational efficiency gains from AI implementation, and the elimination of lower-margin Mobility segment revenue[8]. The company's asset-light model enables substantial incremental margin capture on revenue growth.

Our weighted average cost of capital assumption of 8.5% incorporates the current interest rate environment and S&P Global's moderate leverage profile. The company's strong cash generation and improving credit metrics support this discount rate. Free cash flow margins are expected to remain robust at 35-40% of revenue, reflecting minimal capital intensity requirements[14].

EPS growth bridging current levels to our 2027 target incorporates several key drivers. Revenue growth contributes approximately 60% of earnings expansion, while margin improvement adds another 25%. Share repurchases, funded by strong free cash flow generation, provide the remaining 15% through reduced share count. This analysis yields a 2027 EPS estimate of $19.50, which at a 30x multiple supports our $587 fair value target[6].

### Risk & Uncertainty

Regulatory risk represents the primary uncertainty factor for S&P Global, particularly regarding credit rating activities. Potential changes to NRSRO designation requirements or increased oversight could impact pricing power and market access. Historical legal settlements related to rating practices during the 2008 financial crisis demonstrate ongoing litigation exposure.

Economic sensitivity affects multiple business segments through different transmission mechanisms. Ratings revenue correlates strongly with debt issuance volumes, which decline during economic stress periods. Market Intelligence faces pressure from financial services customers reducing technology spending during downturns. However, this cyclicality is partially offset by increased demand for risk management and analytical tools during volatile periods[9].

Technological disruption poses both opportunities and threats. While S&P Global invests heavily in AI and automation capabilities, emerging competitors could potentially commoditize certain data products or develop alternative analytical approaches[10]. The company's large technology infrastructure requires continuous investment to maintain competitive positioning.

Competitive pressure intensifies across segments as traditional boundaries blur between data providers, exchanges, and technology companies. Bloomberg's comprehensive platform and emerging fintech solutions create ongoing margin pressure. The company must balance pricing power with market share retention as customers evaluate alternative solutions.

Geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty affect global operations and cross-border data flows[9]. Regulatory restrictions on data sharing or market access could impact revenue growth in key international markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific regions where expansion opportunities exist.

### Capital Allocation

S&P Global maintains an excellent capital allocation rating based on disciplined investment decisions, strong balance sheet management, and consistent shareholder returns. The company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.0x provides financial flexibility while maintaining investment-grade credit ratings[14]. Management has demonstrated commitment to deleveraging following the IHS Markit acquisition through strong cash flow generation.

Dividend policy reflects a balanced approach to capital returns, with the company maintaining its Dividend King status through 51 consecutive years of increases[4]. The current dividend yield of 0.7% represents approximately 20% of free cash flow, providing substantial coverage and room for continued growth[1][14]. The conservative payout ratio allows flexibility for opportunistic investments while maintaining reliable income for shareholders.

Share repurchase activity demonstrates management's confidence in long-term value creation. The company deployed $3.3 billion to buybacks in 2024, effectively reducing share count while supporting earnings per share growth[4]. Repurchase timing has generally been disciplined, with increased activity during market dislocations.

Merger and acquisition discipline reflects strategic focus on core competencies and synergistic opportunities. The IHS Markit transaction, while large, created significant cross-selling opportunities and expanded addressable markets[7]. The decision to separate Mobility demonstrates willingness to divest non-core assets when strategic fit diminishes[8].

Organic investment priorities emphasize technology development, data expansion, and product innovation. Capital expenditure requirements remain modest at less than 1% of revenue, with most growth investment flowing through operating expenses for talent acquisition and technology development[14].

### ESG Risk

S&P Global faces medium ESG risk based on industry positioning and operational characteristics. Environmental impact remains limited given the company's asset-light business model with minimal physical infrastructure or manufacturing requirements. However, the company faces increasing scrutiny regarding the environmental implications of its credit rating methodologies and climate risk assessments.

Social factors include data privacy and security responsibilities given the sensitive financial information processed across business segments. The company maintains robust cybersecurity protocols and compliance frameworks to address these obligations. Workforce diversity and inclusion initiatives support talent retention in competitive markets for analytical and technology professionals.

Governance considerations center on the independence and objectivity of credit rating processes, particularly regarding potential conflicts of interest from issuer-pays business models. S&P Global has implemented comprehensive policies and oversight mechanisms following regulatory settlements in previous years. Board composition includes relevant expertise in financial services, technology, and risk management.

Compared to industry peers, S&P Global's ESG profile benefits from its role in facilitating capital market efficiency and transparency. The company's indices and ratings support sustainable finance initiatives, including ESG-focused investment products and climate risk assessment tools. Sustainalytics assigns a medium ESG risk score reflecting these considerations alongside ongoing regulatory oversight requirements.

## Analyst Note

Merck's first-quarter 2025 performance reflects the pharmaceutical giant's transition phase as it manages near-term headwinds while positioning for post-Keytruda growth[5]. Total worldwide sales declined 2% to $15.5 billion, though excluding foreign exchange impacts, sales grew 1%[5]. The quarter was characterized by continued strength in Keytruda, which generated $7.2 billion in sales (up 4%), representing approximately 46% of total revenue[5]. However, Gardasil sales declined sharply by 41% to $1.3 billion, primarily due to ongoing demand weakness in China where economic pressures have affected the cash-pay HPV vaccine market[5].

The company's emerging pipeline showed promising signs, with Winrevair generating $280 million in sales during its early commercial launch for pulmonary arterial hypertension[5]. Animal Health demonstrated resilience with 5% growth to $1.6 billion, excluding foreign exchange impacts growing 10%[5]. Management maintained full-year 2025 sales guidance of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion but revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance slightly lower to $8.82-$8.97, reflecting a one-time charge related to the Hengrui Pharma licensing agreement[5].

Strategically, Merck continues preparing for the 2028 Keytruda patent expiration through pipeline diversification and geographic expansion. The company's cardiometabolic pipeline represents a key growth driver with seven potential approvals anticipated by 2030, targeting peak revenue potential exceeding $15 billion by the mid-2030s[10]. Recent clinical data presentations across multiple therapeutic areas, including subcutaneous pembrolizumab formulations and expanded Winrevair indications, demonstrate execution against strategic priorities[5]. Despite near-term challenges, Merck trades at approximately 76% of estimated fair value, suggesting meaningful upside potential as the market appears to overly discount the company's post-Keytruda transition capabilities[1].

## Business Description

Merck & Co., Inc. operates as an integrated global healthcare company through two primary segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health[4]. The Pharmaceutical segment, representing the vast majority of revenues, focuses on human health pharmaceutical products across oncology, hospital acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes therapeutic areas[4]. The segment also encompasses vaccine products including preventive pediatric, adolescent, and adult immunizations[4].

The company's oncology franchise centers on Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a PD-1 inhibitor that has secured over 40 approved indications across multiple cancer types[10]. Keytruda generated $29.5 billion in 2024 sales, representing the world's best-selling pharmaceutical product[9][10]. The vaccines portfolio is anchored by Gardasil/Gardasil 9, the leading HPV vaccine with historically strong global demand, though recent performance has been impacted by Chinese market dynamics[1][5].

Merck's Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and health management solutions[4]. This division serves both livestock and companion animal markets through drug wholesalers, retailers, hospitals, and veterinary practices globally[4]. The segment also provides digitally connected identification, traceability, and monitoring products, representing an increasingly important technology-enabled component of the animal health business[4].

Geographically, Merck maintains significant exposure to both developed and emerging markets, with particular strength in the United States, Europe, and select Asia-Pacific regions. The company has established manufacturing and research facilities worldwide, enabling global product development and distribution capabilities across its therapeutic portfolios.

## Business Strategy & Outlook

Merck's strategic framework centers on navigating the approaching Keytruda patent cliff while building sustainable long-term growth drivers across diversified therapeutic areas[10]. The company's near-term strategy emphasizes lifecycle management for Keytruda through indication expansion, combination therapies, and alternative formulations including subcutaneous delivery mechanisms[11]. Phase 3 trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety for subcutaneous Keytruda, potentially extending commercial viability beyond patent expiration[11].

The cardiometabolic pipeline represents Merck's most significant strategic bet for post-2028 growth, with management targeting seven potential approvals by 2030 and peak revenue potential exceeding $15 billion by the mid-2030s[10]. Winrevair, approved in March 2024 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, exemplifies this strategy with its broad label enabling physician prescribing flexibility beyond phase 3 study criteria[10]. The company is advancing multiple Winrevair label expansion studies, including recently stopped early trials demonstrating overwhelming efficacy in advanced PAH patients[10].

Beyond pulmonary hypertension, Merck's oral PCSK9 inhibitor MK-0616 represents a potentially transformative cholesterol-lowering therapy that could democratize access to this drug class currently limited to expensive injectables[10]. First pivotal study results are expected in 2025, with management expressing confidence in the oral formulation's risk-benefit profile[10]. The cardiovascular portfolio expansion reflects broader strategic positioning in large addressable markets with significant unmet medical needs.

Strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements support pipeline diversification, as evidenced by the recent exclusive licensing arrangement with Hengrui Pharma for an investigational oral small molecule Lp(a) inhibitor[5]. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, demonstrates continued strategic focus on cardiovascular disease, an area where Merck historically maintained limited presence[5]. Management has indicated willingness to pursue additional business development opportunities in cardiovascular disease and oncology to maintain competitive positioning[1].

## Bulls Say / Bears Say

**Bulls Say:** Merck's diversified pipeline and strategic positioning create multiple pathways for sustainable growth beyond the Keytruda patent cliff. The cardiometabolic franchise alone offers seven potential approvals by 2030 with peak revenue potential exceeding $15 billion, providing substantial offset to anticipated Keytruda erosion[10]. Winrevair's early commercial success and broad label create confidence in management's ability to identify and develop breakthrough therapies in large addressable markets[10]. The company's strong balance sheet, with net debt to EBITDA of only 0.72, provides strategic flexibility for continued pipeline investment and business development[13]. Keytruda's indication expansion and combination therapy development may extend commercial relevance beyond 2028, while geographic expansion opportunities in emerging markets offer additional growth vectors[20]. At current valuations, the market appears to overly discount Merck's transition capabilities, creating attractive risk-adjusted return potential[1].

**Bears Say:** Merck faces unprecedented revenue concentration risk with Keytruda representing 46% of total sales and limited visibility on successful replacement products[9]. Historical precedent suggests blockbuster drugs lose 30-60% of revenue within three years of biosimilar entry, potentially creating a $10-18 billion annual revenue gap that emerging products cannot realistically fill[9]. Gardasil's weakness in China, representing roughly half of the vaccine's global sales, demonstrates vulnerability to geopolitical and economic pressures in key markets[1]. The cardiometabolic pipeline, while promising, remains largely unproven with significant execution risk and uncertain competitive dynamics in crowded therapeutic areas[10]. Rising research and development costs, intensifying pricing pressures from government negotiations, and increasing regulatory scrutiny create structural headwinds for pharmaceutical profitability[3]. Management's guidance revision and absorption of additional tariff costs signal operational challenges that may persist[5].

## Economic Moat

Merck maintains a Wide economic moat through multiple sustainable competitive advantages that protect long-term profitability and market positioning[1]. The company's primary moat source stems from intangible assets, specifically patent protection and regulatory exclusivity across its pharmaceutical portfolio[1]. Keytruda's patent protection extending to 2028 in the United States, 2030 in the European Union, and 2032 in Japan provides multi-year revenue visibility while biosimilar competitors face significant regulatory and manufacturing barriers[3][9].

Beyond patent protection, Merck benefits from substantial switching costs within healthcare systems where physician familiarity, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes create preference for established therapies[14]. Keytruda's extensive clinical data across 40+ indications and combination therapy development create network effects that increase prescribing confidence and limit competitive substitution[10][11]. The vaccine portfolio, particularly Gardasil, benefits from similar dynamics where established vaccination programs and public health recommendations create sustained demand independent of pricing pressures[1].

Research and development capabilities represent another moat component, with Merck's $3.5 billion quarterly R&D investment enabling sustained innovation across multiple therapeutic areas[2]. The company's clinical development expertise, regulatory relationships, and global manufacturing infrastructure create barriers for smaller competitors attempting to develop competing products[10]. Strategic partnerships and licensing agreements, such as the recent Hengrui Pharma arrangement, demonstrate ability to access external innovation while maintaining development and commercialization control[5].

Manufacturing scale and supply chain advantages provide additional moat protection, particularly for complex biologics requiring specialized production capabilities[18]. Merck's global manufacturing footprint enables cost-effective production while maintaining quality standards essential for regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions[18]. The combination of patent protection, switching costs, and operational scale creates multiple defensive layers that sustain profitability despite competitive pressures[1].

## Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Merck's fair value estimate of $111 per share reflects a comprehensive discounted cash flow analysis incorporating revenue growth assumptions, margin projections, and risk-adjusted terminal value calculations[1]. The valuation framework assumes 1% sales growth in 2025, followed by mid-to-high single-digit growth in 2026-2027 as pipeline products gain commercial traction[1]. Revenue growth drivers include Keytruda indication expansion through 2028, Winrevair uptake in pulmonary hypertension, and cardiometabolic pipeline progression toward commercialization[1][10].

Key revenue assumptions incorporate a 34% Gardasil decline in 2025 due to China market dynamics, with gradual recovery anticipated through 2027[1]. Keytruda sales are projected to peak at approximately $41 billion in 2028 before declining to below $10 billion annually by 2032 due to biosimilar competition[1]. This trajectory factors sufficient pressure from patent expiration while acknowledging lifecycle management strategies that may moderate erosion rates[1]. Winrevair is modeled to achieve peak sales around $4 billion, supported by label expansion and market penetration in pulmonary hypertension[1].

Operating margin assumptions reflect continued investment in research and development while benefiting from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies[2]. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to maintain approximately 81% levels, supported by high-margin oncology and vaccine franchises offsetting generic competition impacts[2]. The weighted average cost of capital incorporates current interest rate environments and pharmaceutical industry risk premiums, resulting in discount rates reflecting medium uncertainty ratings[1].

Earnings per share progression from $7.65 in 2024 to projected $8.96 in 2025 and $11.44 by 2030 reflects both near-term pipeline contributions and longer-term growth from emerging therapeutic areas[3]. The valuation supports current trading multiples while incorporating appropriate risk adjustments for patent cliff exposure and pipeline execution uncertainty[1]. At current share prices around $84.71, Merck trades at approximately 76% of estimated fair value, suggesting meaningful upside potential as strategic initiatives demonstrate measurable progress[1].

## Risk & Uncertainty

Merck faces significant regulatory and competitive risks as Keytruda approaches patent expiration in 2028, with biosimilar competition potentially creating revenue erosion of 30-60% within three years of exclusivity loss[9]. The concentration risk is substantial, given Keytruda's 46% contribution to total sales, while limited visibility on replacement product timing and commercial success creates earnings volatility potential[9]. Medicare price negotiation implementation beginning in 2026 may compress margins on key products, while broader government pricing pressures across developed markets threaten long-term profitability[3].

Operational risks include continued Gardasil weakness in China, where economic conditions and cash-pay dynamics have reduced demand for the HPV vaccine[1][5]. Geopolitical tensions and trade policy changes may disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, as evidenced by the estimated $200 million in additional tariff costs absorbed in 2025[5]. Foreign exchange volatility creates earnings translation risk given global revenue exposure, while emerging market economic instability may affect growth projections[5].

Pipeline execution risks encompass clinical trial failures, regulatory delays, and competitive responses that may limit commercial potential for development-stage assets[19]. The gefapixant Complete Response Letter from the FDA demonstrates regulatory uncertainty even for late-stage programs, highlighting the inherent risks in pharmaceutical development[19]. Cardiometabolic pipeline success assumes favorable clinical outcomes and competitive positioning that remain unproven across multiple therapeutic areas[10].

Environmental, social, and governance risks include climate change impacts on operations and supply chains, despite carbon neutrality commitments by 2025[18]. Regulatory scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and access creates reputational risks that may affect government relations and market access[21]. Talent retention and acquisition challenges in competitive biotechnology markets may limit research and development capabilities essential for long-term growth[21]. Legal and regulatory settlements create periodic earnings volatility, while patent litigation outcomes may affect product exclusivity periods and competitive positioning[2].

## Capital Allocation

Merck demonstrates Above Average capital allocation discipline through balanced investment in organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and shareholder returns[3]. The company maintains a conservative debt profile with net debt to EBITDA of 0.72 and interest coverage of 18.77 times, providing strategic flexibility for opportunistic investments[13][17]. Cash flow generation remains robust with operating cash flow of $18.53 billion and free cash flow of $14.72 billion, supporting both growth investments and capital returns[17].

Research and development represents the primary capital allocation priority, with quarterly spending of $3.5 billion demonstrating commitment to pipeline advancement[2]. The investment level, while substantial, reflects industry requirements for sustained innovation and competitive positioning[2]. Strategic acquisitions complement organic development, as demonstrated by the $1.3 billion EyeBio acquisition in 2024 and ongoing licensing agreements such as the Hengrui Pharma arrangement[3][5].

Dividend policy reflects shareholder return commitment with 14 consecutive years of increases and a current yield of 3.82%[3][12]. The quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, raised 5.2% in November 2024, represents a sustainable payout ratio of approximately 42% of earnings[12][16]. Dividend growth rates averaging 6-8% annually over multiple time horizons demonstrate management's confidence in cash flow sustainability[16].

Share repurchase activity remains modest relative to peer companies, with management prioritizing reinvestment in growth opportunities over aggressive buyback programs[3]. The balanced approach to capital allocation reflects recognition of both near-term challenges and long-term opportunities across the pharmaceutical portfolio[3]. Working capital management and asset turnover metrics indicate efficient operational execution supporting cash generation and strategic flexibility[17].

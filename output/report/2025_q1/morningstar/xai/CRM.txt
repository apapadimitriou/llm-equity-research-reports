### Analyst Note
Salesforce Inc. reported fiscal first-quarter 2026 results on May 28, 2025, with revenue reaching $9.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year and in constant currency, exceeding guidance [1]. Subscription and support revenue, the core segment, grew 8% to $9.3 billion, while current remaining performance obligation (cRPO) increased 12% to $29.6 billion, signaling robust future revenue visibility [1]. GAAP operating margin details were partially disclosed, but the company highlighted margin expansion amid AI investments [1].

The quarter underscores Salesforce's resilience in a maturing CRM market, with AI-driven products like Einstein contributing to deal wins [2]. Management raised full-year fiscal 2026 revenue guidance to approximately $41.2 billion, implying 8-9% growth, and projected operating margin at 22% [3]. This beat-and-raise performance contrasts with prior quarters' mixed results, such as fiscal 2025's 9% revenue growth to about $37.8 billion based on aggregated quarterly data [3][4][5][6].

Our thesis remains intact: Salesforce's platform dominance and data cloud ecosystem position it for sustained mid-single-digit growth, bolstered by AI integration. However, deceleration from double-digit historical rates reflects market saturation and competition from Microsoft and Oracle [7]. We maintain our wide moat rating, driven by switching costs and network effects, but note medium uncertainty from economic headwinds and AI adoption risks.

Valuation implies a fair value of $300 per share, based on a discounted cash flow model assuming 8% revenue CAGR through 2029, with margins expanding to 25% by terminal year [8]. At current pricing around $258, the stock appears undervalued by 14%, offering upside potential if AI monetization accelerates [9]. Investors should monitor cRPO trends as a leading indicator; the 12% growth suggests pipeline strength despite macroeconomic caution [1]. Overall, this quarter reinforces Salesforce's transition to an AI-centric CRM leader, though execution on Agentforce and Data Cloud will be key to long-term outperformance.

### Business Description
Salesforce Inc. provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software, enabling businesses to manage sales, service, marketing, and commerce operations [10]. Key segments include Subscription and Support (95% of revenue), encompassing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and emerging AI tools like Einstein [1]. Professional Services contribute the remainder [1]. Geographically, the Americas account for about 70% of revenue, with Europe and Asia-Pacific making up the balance [11].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Salesforce's competitive edge stems from its integrated platform, which leverages vast data ecosystems to deliver AI-powered insights, fostering customer retention through high switching costs [2]. The company is pivoting toward AI agents and Data Cloud to address secular trends like digital transformation and generative AI adoption, aiming to automate workflows and enhance productivity [7].

In the medium term, we expect Salesforce to benefit from enterprise demand for unified data platforms amid cloud migration [12]. Revenue growth is projected at 8-10% annually through 2029, driven by cross-selling and AI upsell, though tempered by economic slowdowns [3]. Margin expansion to the low-20s is anticipated via operational efficiencies and reduced hiring [1].

Challenges include intensifying competition and potential commoditization of CRM tools, but Salesforce's scale and innovation pipeline position it well for sustained leadership [13].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- AI integrations like Einstein and Agentforce are driving upsell opportunities, with Data Cloud adoption accelerating revenue growth [2].  
- Strong cRPO growth of 12% indicates robust backlog and future revenue stability [1].  
- Margin improvements to 22% in fiscal 2026 reflect disciplined cost management [3].  

**Bears Say**  
- Revenue growth slowed to 8% in Q1 fiscal 2026, signaling market maturation and competitive pressures [1].  
- Macroeconomic headwinds could delay deal closures, as seen in prior quarters [4].  
- High valuation multiples may compress if AI monetization underperforms expectations [9].

### Economic Moat
Salesforce maintains a wide economic moat primarily from switching costs and network effects. Customers invest heavily in customizing the platform, making migration costly and disruptive, as evidenced by 95% retention rates in subscription services [11]. Network effects arise from its ecosystem, where third-party apps on AppExchange enhance value, creating a flywheel of data and integrations [10]. Evidence includes consistent double-digit cRPO growth, such as 12% in Q1 fiscal 2026, reflecting locked-in revenue streams [1]. Intangible assets like brand strength further support this, though competition erodes some edges [7].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our fair value estimate of $300 per share is derived from a discounted cash flow model. We forecast revenue CAGR of 8% from fiscal 2025 to 2029, starting from $37.8 billion in 2025 to $53.2 billion in 2029, driven by 9% subscription growth and AI add-ons [3][8]. Operating margins expand from 19% in 2025 to 25% by 2029, via scale efficiencies and reduced R&D intensity [1].

WACC is 9.0%, incorporating a 6% risk-free rate, 5% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.2 [14]. EPS bridges from $9.50 in 2025 to $15.20 in 2029, adding $1.50 from margin gains and $4.20 from revenue [8]. Terminal growth is 4%, yielding a present value of $290 billion in enterprise value, or $300 per share after net debt adjustment [14]. Implied multiples: 7.2x sales and 20x EPS on 2026 estimates [9].

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macroeconomic slowdowns could delay enterprise spending, impacting deal velocity and cRPO [4]. Regulatory risks include data privacy laws like GDPR, potentially increasing compliance costs [15]. ESG factors involve data security breaches, while operational risks stem from AI integration failures or talent retention in tech [2]. These could swing valuation by 20-30%, justifying medium uncertainty [14].

### Capital Allocation
Salesforce's balance sheet is strong, with $18 billion in cash and low debt-to-equity of 0.2 [11]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions like Slack, enhancing ecosystem without overpaying [10]. The company initiated dividends in 2024 and maintains share buybacks, returning $4 billion in fiscal 2025 [16]. This supports a Standard rating, balancing growth investments with shareholder returns [16].

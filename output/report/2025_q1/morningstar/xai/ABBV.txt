### Analyst Note
AbbVie's first-quarter 2025 financial results indicate resilient performance amid ongoing transitions in its product portfolio. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $2.46, marking a 6.5% increase year-over-year, while GAAP diluted EPS was $0.72, reflecting a 6.5% decline likely due to one-time charges or restructuring costs [1][2]. These results align with the company's shift away from Humira dependency, with immunology assets like Skyrizi and Rinvoq driving growth. The quarter's outcomes support our thesis that AbbVie's diversified pipeline and acquisition strategy will sustain mid-single-digit revenue expansion through 2029, despite patent expirations.

Key highlights include stable adjusted earnings growth, underscoring operational efficiency. However, the GAAP EPS drop highlights potential volatility from integration expenses related to recent deals. We maintain our wide moat rating, driven by intangible assets in immunology and oncology. Our fair value estimate of $220 implies a modest upside from the current price of $209, based on a discounted cash flow model projecting 5% revenue CAGR and operating margins stabilizing at 45% by 2027. This valuation incorporates updated Q1 data, with no material changes to our medium-term outlook.

Looking ahead, AbbVie's focus on neuroscience and aesthetics segments positions it well against secular trends in aging populations and chronic disease management. Risks include regulatory scrutiny on pricing and competition in biologics. Overall, the Q1 print reinforces our view of AbbVie as a defensive healthcare play with strong dividend appeal, though investors should monitor pipeline readouts for upside catalysts. We see shares as fairly valued, with potential for rerating if growth accelerators like new approvals materialize.

### Business Description
AbbVie Inc. is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for complex diseases. Its key segments include immunology (e.g., treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis), oncology (cancer therapies), neuroscience (neurological disorders), and aesthetics (botox and fillers post-Allergan acquisition). The company operates primarily in the U.S., with significant revenue from Europe and other international markets [3].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
AbbVie's strategy emphasizes innovation through R&D investment and strategic acquisitions to bolster its pipeline and diversify beyond legacy products like Humira. The company leverages its expertise in biologics to target high-unmet-need areas, such as immunology and oncology, while expanding into aesthetics and eye care.

Secular trends favoring AbbVie include rising prevalence of chronic conditions in aging populations and increasing demand for targeted therapies. In the medium term, we expect revenue growth to accelerate as newer drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq offset Humira biosimilar erosion, with potential for double-digit growth in key segments by 2027.

Overall, the outlook is positive, with management guiding for sustained profitability through cost controls and portfolio optimization [4].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Strong pipeline in immunology and oncology will drive revenue growth beyond Humira's patent cliff.  
2. Consistent dividend increases and share buybacks enhance shareholder returns.  
3. Acquisitions like Allergan provide diversified revenue streams in high-margin aesthetics.

**Bears Say**  
1. Biosimilar competition could erode margins faster than anticipated.  
2. Regulatory pressures on drug pricing may cap upside in key markets.  
3. High debt from acquisitions increases financial risk in a rising-rate environment.

### Economic Moat
AbbVie's wide economic moat stems primarily from intangible assets, including patents and regulatory exclusivity on blockbuster drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which create barriers to entry [3]. Switching costs in chronic therapies further entrench its position, as patients and physicians prefer established treatments. Evidence includes sustained market share in immunology despite competition, with adjusted EPS growth of 6.5% in Q1 2025 [1].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our fair value estimate of $220 is derived from a discounted cash flow model. We project revenue CAGR of 5% from 2025 to 2029, driven by 10% growth in immunology offsetting flat oncology sales. Operating margins are forecasted to expand from 42% in 2025 to 45% by 2027 through cost efficiencies.

WACC is estimated at 8.0%, reflecting sector betas and cost of debt. The EPS bridge starts at $11.00 in 2025, reaching $14.50 by 2029 via margin gains and share repurchases. This implies a forward P/E of 15x on 2026 EPS, consistent with peers. Sensitivity analysis shows fair value ranging $200-$240 based on +/-1% revenue growth.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic downturns reducing healthcare spending. Regulatory risks involve drug pricing reforms, potentially impacting U.S. revenues. Operational risks encompass pipeline failures or supply chain disruptions. ESG factors, such as access to medicines, could affect reputation. These contribute to our high uncertainty rating, with potential valuation swings of 20-30%.

### Capital Allocation
AbbVie's balance sheet is strong, with manageable debt post-acquisitions. M&A discipline is evident in targeted deals like Allergan. The company maintains a robust dividend policy, recently declaring $1.64 quarterly [5], yielding approximately 3%. Buyback programs support EPS growth. We rate capital allocation as exemplary for its shareholder-friendly approach.

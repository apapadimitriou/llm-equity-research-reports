### Analyst Note
Nvidia Corporation reported exceptional results for Q1 fiscal 2025 (ended April 28, 2024), with revenue reaching $26.0 billion, marking an 18% sequential increase and a 262% year-over-year surge [1]. This performance was driven primarily by the Data Center segment, which contributed $22.6 billion in revenue, up 427% year over year, fueled by demand for AI accelerators like the Hopper platform [2]. Gross margins expanded to 78.9% on an adjusted basis, reflecting strong pricing power and operational efficiency, while adjusted EPS hit $6.12, beating expectations by $0.47 [3]. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and a 150% dividend increase to $0.01 per post-split share, signaling confidence in cash flow generation [3].

Our thesis on Nvidia remains intact: the company is poised to capitalize on the AI boom, with generative AI and accelerated computing driving multi-year growth. We update our forecasts to incorporate Q1 results and Q2 guidance of $28.0 billion in revenue, implying 107% year-over-year growth [1]. We project full fiscal 2025 revenue at $111.5 billion, up 83% from fiscal 2024, with Data Center comprising over 85% of sales. However, we note emerging risks from supply chain constraints and competition in AI chips. Our fair value estimate rises to $1300 (pre-split basis) from $1100, based on a discounted cash flow model assuming 35% revenue CAGR through fiscal 2029, driven by AI adoption in data centers, gaming, and automotive [4]. This implies a forward P/E of 40x our fiscal 2026 EPS estimate of $32.50.

Despite a 130% year-to-date stock rally as of May 29, 2024, Nvidia trades at a 12% discount to our fair value, presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors. We maintain our Wide Moat rating, supported by switching costs and network effects in CUDA software ecosystem. Uncertainty is High due to geopolitical tensions affecting chip exports. Overall, Nvidia's leadership in AI positions it for sustained outperformance, though investors should monitor margin pressures from rising R&D costs [5].

### Business Description
Nvidia Corporation designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) and related software for computing, gaming, and AI applications. Key segments include Data Center (AI and cloud computing hardware, 87% of Q1 FY2025 revenue), Gaming (GPUs for PCs and consoles, 10%), Professional Visualization (workstation graphics, 2%), and Automotive (self-driving tech, 1%) [2]. The company operates globally, with 47% of revenue from the U.S., 26% from Taiwan, and 20% from China in fiscal 2024 [6].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Nvidia's strategy centers on leveraging its GPU architecture for accelerated computing, particularly in AI training and inference. The company invests heavily in R&D ($2.2 billion in Q1 FY2025, up 20% year over year) to maintain leadership in high-performance chips like the H100 and upcoming Blackwell series [1]. By bundling hardware with CUDA software, Nvidia creates an ecosystem that locks in developers and enterprises, fostering high switching costs.

Secular trends in AI, cloud computing, and edge devices support a positive medium-term outlook. We expect Data Center revenue to grow at 50% CAGR through fiscal 2027, driven by hyperscaler demand from firms like Microsoft and Amazon [7]. Gaming recovery post-crypto downturn and automotive expansion via partnerships (e.g., with Mercedes-Benz) add diversification. However, U.S. export restrictions to China could cap growth in that market.

Over the next 3-5 years, we see Nvidia achieving 30-40% annual revenue growth, with operating margins stabilizing above 60% as scale offsets competition from AMD and custom chips by tech giants [4].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. AI demand will sustain triple-digit Data Center growth, with Blackwell chips adding $10-15 billion in incremental revenue in fiscal 2026.  
2. CUDA's dominance creates a moat, ensuring 80%+ market share in AI GPUs.  
3. Dividend hike and $13 billion buyback authorization signal strong capital returns [3].

**Bears Say**  
1. Competition from AMD's MI300 and in-house chips by Google/Amazon could erode pricing power, pressuring margins to 70%.  
2. Geopolitical risks, including U.S.-China trade tensions, may reduce China revenue by 20%.  
3. High valuation (50x forward P/E) leaves little room for error if AI hype cools.

### Economic Moat
We assign Nvidia a Wide Moat rating, primarily sourced from intangible assets and switching costs. The CUDA software platform, used by over 4 million developers, creates network effects and high barriers to entry, as migrating to alternatives like AMD's ROCm requires significant redevelopment [7]. Evidence includes Nvidia's 98% share in data center GPUs for AI training [4]. Cost advantages from scale (e.g., 76% gross margins in Q4 FY2024) further reinforce the moat, enabling R&D reinvestment that competitors struggle to match [5].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our fair value estimate of $1300 per share is derived from a discounted cash flow model with a 9.5% WACC and 3% terminal growth rate. We forecast revenue CAGR of 35% from fiscal 2025-2029, starting from $111.5 billion in FY2025 (up 83% YoY, driven by $95 billion in Data Center sales) to $320 billion in FY2029 [4]. Operating margins expand from 55% in FY2024 to 62% by FY2027, reflecting scale efficiencies, then stabilize at 60%.

EPS bridge: FY2024 EPS $11.93 grows to $24.50 in FY2025 (via revenue growth and 78% margins), reaching $65 in FY2029. FCF is projected at $50 billion in FY2025, rising to $150 billion by FY2029, with 25% reinvested in capex. This implies a FY2026 P/E of 40x and EV/EBITDA of 35x at fair value, aligned with growth peers [6].

### Risk & Uncertainty
High Uncertainty stems from macro factors like U.S.-China trade restrictions, which reduced China revenue by 15% in FY2024 [6]. Regulatory risks include antitrust scrutiny on AI market dominance. Operational risks involve supply chain disruptions from TSMC, potentially delaying Blackwell ramps. ESG risks are low but include energy consumption of data centers. These could swing valuation by ±30%.

### Capital Allocation
Nvidia's balance sheet is robust, with $31 billion in cash and $10 billion debt as of Q1 FY2025, yielding a net cash position of $21 billion [1]. M&A discipline is strong, focused on AI tuck-ins like the Run:ai acquisition. The company returned $3.9 billion via buybacks in Q1 FY2025 and raised dividends 150%, with a policy targeting 20-30% FCF payout [3]. We rate capital allocation Excellent.

### ESG Risk
Per Sustainalytics, Nvidia's ESG Risk Rating is Low at 16.7 (as of May 2024), better than the semiconductor peer average of 20.5 [8]. Material issues include carbon emissions from GPU energy use (addressed via efficient designs) and supply chain labor risks. No major controversies; strong governance supports the rating.

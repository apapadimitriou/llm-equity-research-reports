### Analyst Note
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported strong Q1 2025 results, with revenue increasing 36% year-over-year to $7.44 billion, exceeding consensus estimates by $320 million [1]. Non-GAAP earnings per share reached $0.96, slightly above expectations of $0.95, driven by robust performance in data center and client segments [2]. Data center revenue surged 57% to $3.7 billion, fueled by demand for EPYC processors and Instinct GPUs amid AI infrastructure buildouts [3]. Client revenue grew 68%, reflecting recovery in PC markets, while gaming revenue declined 30% due to console cycle maturity [4]. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 54%, up from 52% a year ago, benefiting from a favorable mix toward high-margin data center products [5].

The results reinforce our thesis that AMD is well-positioned to capture share in AI-driven compute markets, competing effectively against Nvidia and Intel. Management guided Q2 revenue to approximately $7.4 billion, implying continued momentum, though export restrictions to China pose headwinds [6]. We maintain our wide moat rating, anchored in switching costs and intangible assets from x86 architecture and GPU designs. Our fair value estimate of $180 per share assumes a 25% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by AI accelerators and server CPUs, with operating margins expanding to 25% by 2027 [7].

Despite a 5.4% after-hours stock rise post-earnings, shares trade at a discount to our valuation, presenting upside potential [8]. However, intensifying competition and macroeconomic risks could pressure growth. We see AMD's AI exposure as a key differentiator, with data center projected to comprise over 50% of revenue by 2026. Investors should monitor GPU ramp-up and PC demand recovery, as these will dictate medium-term performance.

### Business Description
Advanced Micro Devices designs and manufactures semiconductors, focusing on high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies. Key segments include Data Center (servers and accelerators), Client (PC processors), Gaming (console and discrete GPUs), and Embedded (industrial and automotive chips) [1]. The company generates about 50% of revenue from the U.S., with significant exposure to Asia (30%) and Europe (20%), serving customers like cloud providers, PC makers, and gaming firms [9].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
AMD's competitive edge stems from its fabless model, leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for production, which allows focus on design innovation in CPUs and GPUs. The company emphasizes AI and high-performance computing, with products like MI300 accelerators targeting data center AI training and inference [3]. Strategic acquisitions, such as Xilinx in 2022, have bolstered embedded capabilities, diversifying beyond cyclical PC and gaming markets [10].

Secular trends favoring AMD include the explosion of AI workloads, edge computing, and data center expansion, projected to drive global semiconductor demand at a 10% CAGR through 2030 [11]. In the medium term, we expect AMD to gain server market share from Intel, aiming for 30% by 2027, while GPU sales challenge Nvidia in AI [7]. Challenges include supply chain dependencies and geopolitical tensions affecting exports.

Overall, AMD's outlook is positive, with revenue growth accelerating to 20-25% annually through 2027, supported by product roadmaps like Zen 5 CPUs and CDNA 3 GPUs [6]. Margins should improve as scale increases, though competition may cap pricing power.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
Bulls Say:  
1. AMD's data center segment is poised for sustained growth from AI demand, with Instinct GPUs capturing share in hyperscale deployments [3].  
2. Recovery in client PCs and embedded markets provides diversified revenue streams, reducing cyclicality [4].  
3. Strong gross margins from high-margin products signal improving profitability [5].  

Bears Say:  
1. Intensifying competition from Nvidia in GPUs and Intel in CPUs could erode market share [7].  
2. Gaming revenue declines highlight exposure to console cycles, with no near-term catalysts [4].  
3. Export restrictions to China may limit growth in key Asian markets [6].

### Economic Moat
AMD maintains a wide economic moat, primarily from switching costs and intangible assets. Customers in data centers face high barriers to switch from EPYC processors due to ecosystem lock-in, including software optimization and compatibility with x86 architecture, which AMD shares with Intel [12]. Intangible assets include proprietary GPU designs and patents, enabling differentiation in AI accelerators like the MI300 series, which contributed to 57% data center growth in Q1 2025 [3]. Evidence includes AMD's server CPU market share rising from 18% in 2020 to 25% in 2024, driven by performance advantages over rivals [13]. These factors create durable competitive advantages, though not as entrenched as Nvidia's in software ecosystems.

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model projects revenue CAGR of 25% from 2025 to 2029, reaching $70 billion by 2029, with data center growing at 35% annually [7]. We assume operating margins expand from 11% in Q1 2025 to 25% by 2027, driven by scale and mix shift [5]. WACC is 9.5%, reflecting beta of 1.4 and equity risk premium [14]. EPS bridges from $0.96 in Q1 2025 to $6.50 by 2029 via revenue growth (+$4.00), margin expansion (+$1.50), and share buybacks (+$1.00), less taxes and investments (-$1.00) [15]. This yields a fair value of $180, implying 28x 2026 EPS and 8x EV/sales, aligned with peers like Nvidia at 30x [16].

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macroeconomic slowdowns could reduce IT spending, impacting PC and data center demand [11]. Regulatory risks include U.S. export controls on AI chips to China, which shaved Q1 growth [6]. ESG factors involve supply chain emissions and labor issues in Asia. Operational risks encompass semiconductor shortages or execution delays in new product launches [9]. These contribute to medium uncertainty, with a 20% valuation swing possible from demand fluctuations.

### Capital Allocation
AMD's balance sheet is solid, with $6 billion in cash and debt-to-EBITDA below 2x as of Q1 2025 [1]. M&A discipline is evident in the Xilinx integration, enhancing embedded revenue without dilution [10]. The company prioritizes R&D over dividends, with $1.5 billion in share buybacks in 2024 [17]. This supports a standard capital allocation rating, balancing growth investments and shareholder returns.

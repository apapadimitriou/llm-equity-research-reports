### Analyst Note
Amazon.com reported solid Q1 2025 results, with net sales reaching $155.7 billion, up 9% year over year, beating analyst estimates of $155.2 billion [1][2]. Earnings per share came in at $1.59, surpassing expectations of $1.36, driven by operating income of $18.4 billion, a 20% increase, and improved margins at 11.8% [1][3]. AWS segment revenue grew 17% to $29.3 billion, slightly missing estimates but reflecting robust cloud demand amid AI investments [2][3]. Guidance for Q2 net sales of $159.0 billion to $164.0 billion implies 7%-10% growth, aligning with consensus [3][4].

The results underscore Amazon's resilience in e-commerce and cloud computing, with advertising revenue up 18% and subscriptions up 9% [1][5]. Operating margins expanded due to cost efficiencies in fulfillment and AWS scaling [3]. However, the stock dipped 3.3% in after-hours trading on May 1, 2025, amid concerns over AWS growth moderation and broader economic pressures [3][6].

Our thesis remains intact: Amazon's dominant positions in e-commerce (38% U.S. market share) and cloud (31% global share) provide a wide moat, supporting long-term growth [7]. We forecast 10% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by AWS AI tailwinds and e-commerce recovery. Despite high uncertainty from regulatory scrutiny and competition, we view the current valuation as attractive, with our fair value estimate of $210 implying 17% upside from the May 2 close of $179 [8]. Investors should monitor AWS acceleration and margin trends, as they are key to unlocking further value. No changes to our Wide Moat or High Uncertainty ratings.

### Business Description
Amazon.com operates as a leading e-commerce retailer and cloud services provider. Its core business includes online retail of consumer products through its website and apps, serving over 300 million active customers globally [7]. Key segments are North America (60% of revenue), International (27%), and AWS (13%), with operations in over 20 countries [2][9]. The company also offers advertising, streaming via Prime Video, and devices like Kindle and Echo.

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Amazon's strategy focuses on customer obsession, leveraging scale for low prices and fast delivery via Prime membership, which boasts 200 million subscribers [7]. In cloud, AWS emphasizes innovation in AI and machine learning, with services like Bedrock and SageMaker driving adoption [3]. The company invests heavily in logistics, with over 500,000 employees and a vast fulfillment network [9].

Secular trends favor Amazon, including e-commerce penetration (expected to reach 25% of U.S. retail by 2029) and cloud migration, projected to grow at 20% annually through 2028 [7][8]. Medium-term, we expect AWS to benefit from AI boom, potentially adding $10 billion in incremental revenue by 2027 [3]. However, international expansion faces headwinds from competition and regulation.

Overall, Amazon's outlook is positive, with projected 10%-12% annual growth through 2027, supported by margin expansion to 12%-14% as cost optimizations mature [2][8].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- AWS's leadership in cloud and AI positions it for outsized growth as enterprises increase spending [3].  
- E-commerce dominance and Prime ecosystem create sticky revenue streams with high margins [7].  
- Advertising business, growing 18% in Q1, offers diversification and profitability upside [1].  

**Bears Say**  
- Slowing AWS growth to 17% signals intensifying competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud [3].  
- Regulatory risks, including antitrust probes, could limit acquisitions and market power [10].  
- Macroeconomic pressures may curb consumer spending, impacting e-commerce volumes [4].

### Economic Moat
Amazon possesses a Wide Economic Moat, primarily from network effects and cost advantages. In e-commerce, its marketplace connects 2.5 million third-party sellers with billions of buyers, creating a flywheel where more participants enhance value and deter entry [7]. AWS benefits from switching costs, as clients invest in its ecosystem, with data showing 90% retention rates [8]. Scale enables cost leadership, with fulfillment expenses per unit 20% lower than peers [2]. Evidence includes sustained ROIC above 10% and market share gains, justifying the Wide rating [9].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 10% revenue CAGR from 2025-2029, driven by 15% AWS growth and 8% e-commerce expansion [2][8]. We project operating margins improving from 8.5% in 2024 to 13% by 2029, fueled by AWS scale (39% Q1 margins) and supply chain efficiencies [1][3]. WACC is 8.0%, reflecting beta of 1.2 and equity risk premium [8].

EPS bridge: 2024 base $4.50, plus $1.20 from revenue growth, $0.80 from margin gains, minus $0.30 tax/interest, yielding 2025 EPS of $6.20 [2]. Terminal growth 4%, implying fair value of $210 per share, or 34x 2025 EPS and 3.2x sales [8].

### Risk & Uncertainty
High Uncertainty stems from macroeconomic slowdowns potentially reducing consumer and enterprise spending, with a 10% revenue miss possible in recessions [4]. Regulatory risks include FTC antitrust suits that could force divestitures [10]. ESG issues involve labor practices and emissions from data centers [11]. Operational risks include supply chain disruptions and cybersecurity threats to AWS [3]. These could swing valuation by 30%.

### Capital Allocation
Amazon maintains a strong balance sheet with $85 billion in cash and debt-to-equity of 0.4 [9]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted deals like iRobot, though some face scrutiny [10]. No dividends, but $10 billion in buybacks in 2024 support shareholder returns [2]. Investments prioritize growth, earning an Exemplary rating.

### Analyst Note
Amgen Inc. reported strong financial results for Q1 2025, with global demand for its products driving performance amid new launches and positive clinical trial outcomes [1]. The company highlighted ongoing Phase 3 trial successes for several products, positioning it for continued growth in key therapeutic areas [1]. Revenue growth was supported by established brands and emerging therapies, including MariTide, a differentiated peptide-antibody conjugate targeting GLP-1 receptors [1]. Amgen declared a Q1 2025 dividend increase of 6% year-over-year, reflecting confidence in cash flow generation [1]. The company also reduced principal debt and avoided share repurchases in the quarter, focusing on strategic capital allocation [1].

This performance aligns with our thesis that Amgen's diversified portfolio in oncology, inflammation, and rare diseases provides resilience against patent expirations and biosimilar competition. Q1 results showed robust demand, partially offset by timing of working capital and higher capital expenditures [1]. Key highlights include progress on MariTide and other pipeline assets, which could expand Amgen's presence in high-growth areas like obesity and metabolic disorders [1]. We maintain our wide moat rating, driven by intangible assets from patents and brand strength, though we note emerging pressures from biosimilars eroding sales of legacy products like Prolia [4].

Looking ahead, Amgen's 2025 guidance includes share repurchases not exceeding $500 million and accounts for implemented tariffs, excluding potential future ones [1]. Our fair value estimate of $360 incorporates a revenue CAGR of 5% over the next five years, supported by new product ramps and acquisitions. However, risks from pricing pressures and competitive launches warrant monitoring [6]. Overall, the Q1 beat on expectations reinforces our buy recommendation, with the stock trading at a discount to fair value [5]. We see upside from pipeline advancements, though macro uncertainties could impact near-term sentiment.

### Business Description
Amgen Inc. is a biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics. It focuses on areas including oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, and neuroscience [1]. Key products include treatments for cancer, osteoporosis, and rare diseases. The company operates primarily in the United States, with significant revenue from Europe and other international markets [1]. Amgen's portfolio includes both innovative biologics and biosimilars, with a pipeline emphasizing novel conjugates like MariTide for metabolic conditions [1].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Amgen's competitive edge stems from its focus on innovative biologics and a robust R&D pipeline, leveraging proprietary platforms to address unmet needs in chronic diseases. The company invests heavily in Phase 3 trials for differentiated assets, such as MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while antagonizing others, potentially offering advantages in obesity management [1]. Strategic acquisitions and partnerships enhance its portfolio, while biosimilar development provides revenue diversification amid patent cliffs for legacy drugs.

Secular trends favoring Amgen include aging populations driving demand for oncology and bone health therapies, as well as rising prevalence of metabolic disorders boosting anti-obesity drug markets [1]. In the medium term, we expect Amgen to navigate biosimilar competition through pipeline innovation and global expansion, targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth [5]. However, pricing pressures in the U.S. and Europe could constrain margins [6].

Overall, Amgen's outlook remains positive, with new launches expected to offset declines in mature products. The company's guidance for 2025 emphasizes disciplined capital deployment, including limited share repurchases, positioning it for sustainable earnings growth [1].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Strong Q1 2025 demand and Phase 3 trial successes signal robust pipeline momentum, particularly for MariTide in high-growth obesity markets [1].  
2. Dividend increase of 6% and debt reduction demonstrate financial health and shareholder returns [1].  
3. Diversified portfolio mitigates biosimilar erosion, with AI-driven revenue growth potential [2].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Biosimilar launches targeting key products like Prolia could accelerate sales declines starting in 2025 [4].  
2. Pricing pressures and tariffs may compress margins, as noted in guidance excluding future implementations [1].  
3. Higher capital expenditures and working capital timing offset some Q1 gains, raising execution risks [1].

### Economic Moat
Amgen maintains a wide economic moat primarily from intangible assets, including patents and regulatory exclusivity on its biologic therapies [1]. Its portfolio of high-margin drugs, such as those in oncology and bone health, benefits from strong brand loyalty and switching costs for patients and providers [5]. Evidence includes consistent revenue from established products despite competition, with Q1 2025 showing global demand strength [1]. Additionally, Amgen's R&D scale enables pipeline innovation, like MariTide, reinforcing its competitive position [1]. However, moat erosion is possible from biosimilars post-patent expiry [4].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 5% revenue CAGR from 2025-2029, driven by new product launches offsetting biosimilar impacts [5]. We project operating margins expanding to 40% by 2029 from 36% in 2024, reflecting cost efficiencies and high-margin biologics [6]. WACC is estimated at 7.5%, incorporating a beta of 0.8 and risk-free rate of 4.0%.

EPS bridge: Starting from 2024 EPS of $18.50, we add $1.20 from revenue growth, $0.80 from margin expansion, subtract $0.50 for R&D investments, yielding 2025 EPS of $20.00 [5]. This flows to a terminal growth rate of 3%, resulting in a fair value of $360, implying a 2025 P/E multiple of 18x and EV/EBITDA of 12x.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include inflation and interest rate hikes increasing borrowing costs, potentially impacting R&D funding [1]. Regulatory risks involve drug pricing reforms in the U.S., which could reduce revenues [6]. ESG risks center on access to medicines and clinical trial ethics. Operational risks include biosimilar competition eroding sales of key drugs like Prolia, with launches expected in 2025 [4]. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with a potential valuation swing of ±20%.

### Capital Allocation
Amgen's balance sheet is strong, with debt reduction in Q1 2025 and ample liquidity [1]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions supporting pipeline growth. The company maintains a progressive dividend policy, with a 6% Q1 increase, and limits buybacks to $500 million in 2025 [1]. This prudent approach earns an exemplary rating.

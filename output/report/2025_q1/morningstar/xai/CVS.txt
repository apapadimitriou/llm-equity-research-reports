### Analyst Note
CVS Health Corp reported first-quarter 2025 results on May 1, 2025, with total revenues reaching $94.6 billion, a 7.0% increase year-over-year, driven by growth in its Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Services segments [1]. GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.41, while adjusted EPS was $2.25, reflecting operational efficiencies amid rising medical costs in the Health Care Benefits segment [1]. Cash flow from operations stood at $4.6 billion, supporting liquidity for ongoing investments [1]. The company updated its full-year 2025 guidance, raising adjusted EPS to $6.00-$6.20 from $5.75-$6.00, and cash flow from operations to approximately $7.0 billion, while lowering GAAP EPS to $4.23-$4.43 due to restructuring charges and higher medical loss ratios [1]. Key operational highlights included exiting the individual exchange business to focus on core Medicare and Medicaid lines, introducing new Aetna solutions for patient experience, and updating CVS Caremark formularies to enhance access to GLP-1 drugs [1].

This performance aligns with our thesis that CVS's integrated model—combining retail pharmacy, pharmacy benefits management (PBM), and health insurance—positions it well to capture value from rising healthcare demand, though margin pressures from elevated utilization in Medicare Advantage persist. Revenue growth exceeded expectations, but the 11% rise in medical benefit ratio to 89.6% signals ongoing challenges in the insurance unit [1]. Compared to full-year 2024 results, where revenues were $372.8 billion (up 4.2%) and adjusted EPS $5.42, the Q1 uptick suggests momentum in pharmacy services amid industry-wide GLP-1 demand [2]. We maintain our wide moat rating, supported by network scale and switching costs, but note medium uncertainty from regulatory scrutiny on PBMs and drug pricing.

Our fair value estimate of $85 per share implies a forward P/E of 11.5x our 2025 adjusted EPS forecast of $7.40, above guidance midpoint to account for potential margin recovery. Thesis update: We see medium-term upside from cost-saving initiatives and biosimilar adoption, but downside risks from sustained high medical costs could pressure 2025 profitability. Overall, shares appear undervalued at current levels, with potential for 13% upside to our FVE.

### Business Description
CVS Health Corp operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States, providing pharmacy services, health insurance, and consumer wellness products [1]. Key segments include Health Care Benefits (insurance via Aetna), Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness (retail pharmacies and consumer health), and Health Services (PBM through CVS Caremark and specialty pharmacy) [1]. The company serves over 100 million plan members and operates approximately 9,000 retail locations primarily in the U.S., with minimal international exposure [3].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
CVS Health's strategy centers on its integrated care model, leveraging synergies across pharmacy, PBM, and insurance to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes [1]. This includes vertical integration, such as Aetna's coordination with CVS pharmacies for seamless care delivery, and investments in digital tools like telehealth and AI-driven formularies to enhance efficiency [1]. The company is addressing industry challenges by exiting low-margin businesses, such as individual exchanges, and expanding access to high-demand drugs like GLP-1s for weight management [1].

Secular trends favoring CVS include aging populations driving Medicare demand, rising chronic disease prevalence boosting pharmacy volumes, and a shift toward value-based care [1]. However, headwinds from increasing medical utilization and drug costs could compress margins [1]. Over the medium term (3-5 years), we expect revenue growth of 5-7% annually, supported by PBM contract wins and retail expansion, though profitability may stabilize as cost controls take hold [4].

In a competitive landscape with peers like UnitedHealth and Walgreens, CVS's scale provides an edge in negotiating with drug manufacturers and providers, positioning it for sustained market share gains in a $4 trillion U.S. healthcare market [3].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Integrated model drives cost savings and revenue synergies, with Q1 2025 revenues up 7.0% from cross-segment efficiencies [1].  
2. Strong cash flow of $4.6 billion in Q1 supports investments in growth areas like GLP-1 access and digital health [1].  
3. Raised 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.00-$6.20 signals confidence in margin recovery amid industry trends [1].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Elevated medical benefit ratio of 89.6% in Q1 indicates persistent pressure from higher utilization in Medicare Advantage [1].  
2. Lowered GAAP EPS guidance to $4.23-$4.43 reflects restructuring costs and operational challenges [1].  
3. Competitive PBM landscape and regulatory scrutiny could limit pricing power and contract renewals [5].

### Economic Moat
We assign CVS Health a wide economic moat, primarily driven by intangible assets and network effects. The company's vast PBM network through CVS Caremark covers millions of lives, creating high switching costs for clients due to integrated data systems and customized formularies [1]. Evidence includes consistent revenue growth, with Health Services up 9.5% in Q1 2025 from contract expansions [1]. Additionally, brand strength in retail pharmacy, with over 9,000 locations, fosters customer loyalty and supplier leverage [3]. These factors have sustained ROIC above WACC, averaging 8% over the past three years [2].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 5.5% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by 6% growth in Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness from prescription volumes and 5% in Health Care Benefits from membership gains [4]. We project operating margins expanding from 4.2% in 2024 to 5.0% by 2027, incorporating cost savings of $1 billion annually from efficiency initiatives [1]. WACC is set at 7.0%, reflecting a beta of 0.9 and cost of debt at 4.5%.

EPS bridge: Starting from 2024 adjusted EPS of $5.42, we add $0.98 from revenue growth, subtract $0.20 from margin pressure, yielding 2025 EPS of $6.20 (aligned with guidance midpoint) [2]. Terminal growth of 3% leads to our fair value of $85 per share, implying a 2025 EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.5x and P/E of 13.7x, reasonable given peers' averages [6].

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include inflation-driven medical cost increases, potentially raising the Q1 2025 medical benefit ratio further [1]. Regulatory pressures, such as FTC scrutiny on PBM practices, could impact rebates and pricing [5]. Operational risks involve cyber threats to health data, as seen in industry breaches, and supply chain disruptions affecting pharmacy inventory. ESG factors like drug affordability could lead to reputational damage. These contribute to medium uncertainty, with a 20% valuation swing possible from adverse outcomes.

### Capital Allocation
CVS maintains a solid balance sheet with net debt/EBITDA at 3.2x as of Q1 2025, supported by $4.6 billion in operating cash flow [1]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions like Signify Health, enhancing home health capabilities without overleveraging [3]. The company pays a quarterly dividend yielding 3.5% and has authorized $10 billion in share buybacks, though paused amid volatility [2]. We rate capital allocation as standard, balancing growth and returns.

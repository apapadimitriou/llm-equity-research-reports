### Analyst Note
Merck & Co. reported first-quarter 2025 financial results on April 24, 2025, with total worldwide sales of $15.5 billion, reflecting a 2% decline from the first quarter of 2024, or 1% growth excluding foreign exchange impacts [1]. The oncology segment remained a key driver, led by Keytruda sales of $7.2 billion, up 4% year over year, or 6% ex-FX, supported by expanded indications in metastatic and early-stage cancers [1]. New product Winrevair contributed $280 million in sales following its recent launch for pulmonary arterial hypertension [1]. Animal health revenues grew 5% to $1.6 billion, or 10% ex-FX, driven by companion animal and livestock products [1]. However, vaccine sales faced headwinds, with Gardasil/Gardasil 9 declining 41% to $1.3 billion, or 40% ex-FX, due to inventory dynamics and competitive pressures in key markets [1].

GAAP EPS was $2.01, while non-GAAP EPS reached $2.22, benefiting from operational efficiencies despite higher R&D spending on clinical trials [1]. The company presented positive data from phase 3 trials, including subcutaneous Keytruda with berahyaluronidase alfa and Winrevair in high-risk PAH patients, signaling potential label expansions [1]. Additionally, phase 3 results for an investigational oral two-drug regimen in HIV were highlighted, bolstering the pipeline [1].

This quarter underscores Merck's reliance on Keytruda, which accounted for approximately 46% of sales, amid looming patent cliffs [1]. Growth in cardiovascular and animal health segments provides diversification, but vaccine softness raises concerns about segment volatility. Our thesis remains intact: Merck's wide moat from oncology dominance supports long-term value, though we monitor competitive threats and regulatory risks. We maintain a fair value estimate of $135 per share, implying a forward P/E of about 15x our 2025 EPS forecast, reflecting balanced growth prospects and risks. Recent stock analysis indicates mixed technical signals, with potential upside of 19.37% based on analyst targets [2][3]. Overall, Q1 results align with expectations, reinforcing a stable outlook despite near-term challenges.

### Business Description
Merck & Co. is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing innovative medicines, vaccines, and animal health products. Key segments include human health pharmaceuticals (oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care, cardiovascular, and others), which generated the majority of revenues, and animal health, contributing about 10% of sales [1]. Flagship products include Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for oncology, Gardasil for HPV prevention, and Winrevair (sotatercept) for pulmonary arterial hypertension [1]. Geographically, the U.S. represents over 50% of sales, with significant presence in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets [1].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Merck's strategy emphasizes pipeline innovation and portfolio diversification to extend leadership in oncology while expanding into cardiovascular and infectious diseases. The company invests heavily in R&D, with recent focus on combination therapies and next-generation modalities like subcutaneous formulations to enhance patient access and compliance [1]. Acquisitions and partnerships, such as the integration of prior deals, support growth in animal health and rare diseases.

Secular trends favor Merck, including aging populations driving oncology demand and rising pet ownership boosting animal health. However, patent expirations for Keytruda by 2028 pose risks, prompting emphasis on successors like investigational oral HIV regimens [1]. Medium-term, we expect 4-6% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by Winrevair ramp-up and oncology expansions, though vaccine competition may temper growth [1][4].

In a competitive landscape, Merck's scale enables efficient manufacturing and global distribution, positioning it well against peers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Outlook remains positive, with potential for margin expansion from cost controls, assuming successful trial outcomes and regulatory approvals [1].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- Keytruda's dominant market share in immuno-oncology, with ongoing label expansions, supports sustained revenue growth [1].  
- Winrevair's strong Q1 launch and phase 3 data indicate blockbuster potential in cardiovascular markets [1].  
- Animal health segment's resilience, with 10% ex-FX growth, provides diversification amid human health volatility [1].  

**Bears Say**  
- Gardasil's 41% sales decline highlights vulnerability to inventory fluctuations and competition in vaccines [1].  
- Heavy reliance on Keytruda exposes Merck to patent cliffs and biosimilar threats post-2028 [1].  
- Elevated R&D costs from multiple phase 3 trials could pressure margins if approvals are delayed [1].  

### Economic Moat
Merck maintains a wide economic moat primarily from intangible assets in its oncology portfolio, particularly Keytruda, which holds leading positions in multiple cancer indications due to strong clinical efficacy data and regulatory exclusivity [1]. Switching costs are high for patients and providers, as treatment protocols are embedded in guidelines. The animal health business adds network effects through integrated supply chains [1]. Evidence includes Keytruda's 6% ex-FX growth despite mature markets, reflecting durable competitive advantages [1].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 5-year revenue CAGR of 5%, driven by 8% growth in oncology offset by flat vaccine sales [1]. We project operating margins expanding from 28% in 2024 to 32% by 2029, reflecting scale efficiencies and Winrevair contributions [1]. WACC is 7.5%, incorporating a beta of 0.8 and equity risk premium of 5%.

EPS bridge: 2024 base EPS of $8.50 grows to $9.00 in 2025 via revenue uplift, yielding fair value of $135 [modeled]. Implied 2025 P/E is 15x and EV/EBITDA 12x, aligned with peers.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include currency fluctuations, as seen in 2% sales headwind [1]. Regulatory hurdles could delay pipeline approvals, while ESG factors like drug pricing scrutiny pose threats. Operational risks involve supply chain disruptions in vaccines [1]. Medium uncertainty reflects balanced growth drivers against patent risks.

### Capital Allocation
Merck's balance sheet is strong, with ample liquidity supporting R&D and dividends. M&A discipline is evident in targeted deals like Acceleron for Winrevair. Consistent dividends and buybacks yield an exemplary rating [1].

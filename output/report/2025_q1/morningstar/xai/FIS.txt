### Analyst Note
Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) reported Q1 2025 results that exceeded consensus expectations, underscoring resilience in its core banking and capital markets segments amid a challenging macroeconomic environment [1]. Revenue reached $2.47 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by 4% growth in Banking Solutions and 5% in Capital Markets, partially offset by flat performance in Corporate and Other [1]. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.10, beating estimates by $0.14, supported by margin expansion to 40.1% from cost efficiencies post the Worldpay divestiture [1]. Management raised full-year 2025 guidance, projecting revenue growth of 3-4% and adjusted EPS of $4.95-$5.05, reflecting confidence in recurring revenue streams and new client wins [1].

The results highlight FIS's strategic pivot following the January 2024 sale of its Worldpay merchant solutions business to GTCR for $18.5 billion, which allowed the company to reduce debt by $5 billion and focus on higher-margin software and services [2]. Banking Solutions, accounting for 60% of revenue, benefited from increased demand for digital transformation tools, with notable wins in core processing and treasury management [1]. Capital Markets saw strength in risk and compliance software, aided by regulatory tailwinds. However, foreign exchange headwinds and slower enterprise spending tempered overall growth.

Our thesis remains intact: FIS is well-positioned as a leading fintech provider with sticky, mission-critical solutions that generate stable cash flows. We maintain our wide moat rating, driven by switching costs and network effects. The Q1 beat supports our fair value estimate of $85 per share, implying a forward P/E of 17x our 2025 EPS forecast. Upside risks include accelerated adoption of AI-driven analytics, while downside stems from potential economic slowdowns affecting bank IT budgets. Shares traded up 5% post-earnings, closing at $74.18 on May 7, 2025, offering a 15% upside to our FVE [3]. We view FIS as a buy for long-term investors seeking exposure to fintech stability.

### Business Description
Fidelity National Information Services provides technology solutions for financial institutions, merchants, and corporations worldwide. Key segments include Banking Solutions (core processing, digital banking, and payments), Capital Markets (trading, risk management, and compliance software), and Corporate and Other (treasury and liquidity management). The company operates primarily in North America (70% of revenue), with growing presence in Europe and Asia-Pacific [2].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
FIS focuses on delivering integrated software platforms that enhance operational efficiency for banks and capital markets firms, leveraging its scale to invest in innovation such as cloud-based solutions and AI analytics. The strategy emphasizes cross-selling to existing clients and expanding into high-growth areas like embedded finance and regulatory compliance tools [4].

Secular trends favoring FIS include the shift to digital banking and increasing regulatory requirements, which drive demand for its software. Medium-term, we expect 3-5% annual revenue growth through 2029, supported by recurring fees (85% of revenue) and modest M&A [2]. However, competition from fintech disruptors and legacy system integrations pose challenges.

In a post-Worldpay era, FIS aims to achieve operating margins above 40% by streamlining costs and prioritizing high-margin segments [1].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. FIS's wide moat from switching costs ensures high client retention, with 95% recurring revenue providing stability [2].  
2. Regulatory pressures on banks boost demand for FIS's compliance and risk software, driving mid-single-digit growth [4].  
3. Debt reduction from the Worldpay sale strengthens the balance sheet, enabling share buybacks and dividends [1].

**Bears Say**  
1. Economic slowdowns could reduce bank IT spending, pressuring revenue growth below 3% [3].  
2. Intense competition from players like Fiserv and Jack Henry may erode market share in core banking [4].  
3. Integration risks from past acquisitions could lead to higher-than-expected costs [2].

### Economic Moat
We assign FIS a wide moat, primarily sourced from high switching costs and network effects. Clients rely on FIS's integrated platforms for mission-critical functions like core banking and payments processing, where migration costs can exceed 2-3 years of fees, leading to 98% retention rates [2]. Network effects arise from its ecosystem connecting thousands of financial institutions, enhancing data analytics and interoperability [4]. Evidence includes consistent 40%+ gross margins and ROIC above 10% over the past five years, outperforming peers [5].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our DCF model assumes a 3.5% revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by 4% growth in Banking and 5% in Capital Markets, with Corporate flat [1]. We project operating margins expanding from 39% in 2024 to 42% by 2029 via cost synergies. WACC is 8.5%, reflecting a 3% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.1.

EPS bridge: 2024 base $4.65 → +$0.40 from revenue growth → +$0.30 from margin expansion → -$0.10 from higher taxes → 2025 EPS $5.25. Terminal growth 3%, yielding fair value of $85 per share, implying 16x forward P/E and 3.5x EV/sales [3].

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include recessionary pressures reducing financial sector IT budgets, potentially cutting revenue by 2-4% [3]. Regulatory changes in data privacy or antitrust could increase compliance costs. ESG risks involve data security breaches, with operational disruptions from cyberattacks. We rate uncertainty medium, as 85% recurring revenue mitigates volatility, but earnings could swing ±15% on economic shifts [4].

### Capital Allocation
FIS maintains a strong balance sheet with net debt/EBITDA at 2.5x post-Worldpay sale, down from 4x [2]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions like Payrix for payments tech. The company returned $1.2 billion via dividends (yield 2.8%) and buybacks in 2024, with plans for $2 billion in 2025 [1]. We rate capital allocation standard, balancing growth and shareholder returns without excessive risk.

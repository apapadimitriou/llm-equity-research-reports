### Analyst Note
Keysight Technologies delivered solid first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, with revenue and orders showing year-over-year growth, surpassing the high end of guidance [1]. This performance reflects a gradual market recovery, driven by robust demand in key areas like communications and electronic industrial solutions. The company reported continued strength in its innovation pipeline, supporting a return to growth amid stabilizing end markets [1]. For Q1 ended January 31, 2025, the results align with management's view of a progressive improvement throughout the year, with orders indicating positive momentum.

Following the Q2 earnings release on May 20, 2025, Keysight again exceeded guidance on revenue and earnings per share, leading to an improved full-year outlook [2]. This underscores the resilience of Keysight's portfolio in high-growth areas such as AI-driven data centers, automotive electrification, and next-generation communications. The stock surged post-Q2 announcement, reflecting investor confidence in the company's execution and market positioning [4]. However, the demand environment remains consistent with expectations of a measured recovery, without significant acceleration in core markets.

Our thesis remains intact: Keysight benefits from its leadership in test and measurement solutions, enabling it to capture secular trends in technology advancement. We maintain a wide moat rating due to switching costs and intangible assets from its software and hardware ecosystem. The fair value estimate of $175 incorporates a 5% revenue CAGR over the next five years, driven by expansion in AI and 6G technologies, with operating margins stabilizing around 25% [1][2]. Upside risks include faster adoption of AI infrastructure, while downside stems from prolonged weakness in semiconductor and general electronics sectors. Overall, the shares appear fairly valued at current levels, with medium uncertainty tied to macroeconomic factors. We see potential for mid-single-digit EPS growth in FY2025, supported by disciplined cost management and share repurchases [2]. This positions Keysight well for sustained profitability as markets normalize.

### Business Description
Keysight Technologies provides electronic design, test, and measurement solutions to industries including communications, aerospace and defense, automotive, and semiconductors. Key segments include Communications Solutions Group (CSG), focusing on wireless and wireline technologies, and Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG), targeting general electronics and automotive applications [1]. The company operates globally, with significant revenue from the Americas (approximately 40%), Asia-Pacific (40%), and Europe (20%) based on recent filings [3].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Keysight's strategy centers on leveraging its integrated hardware-software platforms to address complex testing needs in emerging technologies like 5G/6G, AI, and electric vehicles. The company invests heavily in R&D to maintain technological leadership, with a focus on software-centric solutions that enhance customer workflows and reduce time-to-market [1][2]. This approach creates sticky customer relationships through high switching costs and data interoperability.

Secular trends favoring Keysight include the proliferation of AI data centers, requiring advanced network testing, and the shift to electrification in automotive and energy sectors. Medium-term, we expect gradual recovery in 2025, with revenue growth accelerating in the second half as inventory corrections in semiconductors abate [1]. Management's outlook points to improved orders and revenues, driven by innovation in millimeter-wave and RF technologies [2].

Over the next 3-5 years, Keysight is positioned to benefit from increased capital spending in communications infrastructure and defense, though competition from peers like Rohde & Schwarz could pressure pricing. Overall, the outlook is positive, with potential for high-single-digit growth if global tech spending rebounds.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Robust innovation in AI and 6G testing positions Keysight for outsized growth in data center and communications markets [1].  
2. Strong order growth in Q1 and Q2 signals a sustainable recovery, with improved full-year guidance [2].  
3. Diversified portfolio across segments reduces reliance on any single end market, enhancing resilience [3].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Prolonged weakness in semiconductor and general electronics could delay recovery beyond 2025 [1].  
2. Intense competition and pricing pressures may compress margins in core testing equipment [2].  
3. Macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and supply chain issues, could impact customer spending [4].  

### Economic Moat
Keysight holds a wide economic moat, primarily sourced from intangible assets and switching costs. Its proprietary software platforms, integrated with hardware, create high barriers to entry, as customers invest significantly in Keysight's ecosystem for design validation and testing [1]. Evidence includes consistent market share in RF and microwave testing, with long-term contracts in defense and communications [3]. Switching costs are evident in the time and expense required to retrain teams on alternative systems, supporting pricing power and gross margins above 60% historically [2].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 5% revenue CAGR from FY2025 to FY2029, driven by 6% growth in CSG (AI and 5G demand) and 4% in EISG (automotive recovery) [1][2]. We project operating margins expanding to 26% by FY2027 from 24% in FY2024, reflecting scale efficiencies and software mix shift, though offset by R&D investments at 15% of revenue [3]. WACC is estimated at 8.5%, incorporating a beta of 1.1 and cost of equity of 9.5%.

EPS bridge: FY2024 EPS of $6.50 grows to $7.20 in FY2025 (+11%) via revenue uplift and margin gains, reaching $9.00 by FY2029 [2]. Terminal growth rate is 3%, yielding a fair value of $175, implying a forward P/E of 24x FY2025 EPS and EV/EBITDA of 18x. This is a premium to peers, justified by moat strength.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic slowdowns reducing capex in tech and defense sectors, potentially lowering revenue by 5-10% [1]. Regulatory risks involve export controls on advanced tech to regions like China, impacting Asia-Pacific sales [3]. ESG risks center on supply chain sustainability, with potential disruptions from raw material shortages. Operational risks include competition eroding market share. Medium uncertainty reflects cyclical end markets, with a 20% valuation swing possible from demand fluctuations.

### Capital Allocation
Keysight maintains a strong balance sheet with net debt-to-EBITDA below 1x and cash reserves exceeding $2B [3]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions enhancing software capabilities, avoiding overpayment. The company returns capital via dividends (none currently, focus on buybacks) and $500M annual repurchases, supporting EPS growth [2]. Overall rating: Standard, due to efficient allocation without aggressive leverage.

### Analyst Note
S&P Global reported strong Q1 2025 results, with revenue and earnings surpassing consensus expectations amid resilient demand for its data and analytics services [1]. Adjusted revenue reached $3.55 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by a 15% increase in the Ratings segment and 10% growth in Market Intelligence [1]. Adjusted EPS came in at $4.01, beating estimates by $0.33, supported by margin expansion to 48% from cost efficiencies post-IHS Markit integration [1]. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion, aligning with guidance for full-year 2025 FCF of approximately $6 billion [2]. Management raised its full-year revenue guidance to 8-10% growth, reflecting optimism in subscription-based revenues and AI-driven product enhancements [3].

The thesis for S&P Global remains intact, emphasizing its dominant position in credit ratings and financial data markets. The company's moat is reinforced by regulatory barriers in ratings and network effects in data platforms, enabling consistent pricing power and high margins [4]. However, near-term headwinds include macroeconomic uncertainty impacting issuance volumes, which declined 5% in Q1 due to higher interest rates [1]. Positively, the Mobility and Commodity Insights segments showed robust growth, up 18% combined, benefiting from energy transition trends and automotive data demand [5].

Looking ahead, we maintain our wide moat rating and project mid-single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029, driven by secular shifts toward data analytics and sustainability reporting. Our fair value estimate of $500 implies a 20% upside from the current price, based on a discounted cash flow model with 8% WACC [6]. Valuation multiples are attractive at 25x forward P/E versus historical averages of 28x, suggesting the market undervalues S&P Global's recession-resilient model [7]. Risks include potential antitrust scrutiny on market dominance, but recent leadership changes in Mobility signal strategic focus on innovation [8]. Overall, Q1 results affirm our buy recommendation for long-term investors seeking exposure to financial infrastructure.

### Business Description
S&P Global provides financial data, analytics, and credit ratings to global markets. Key segments include Ratings (credit assessments for debt issuers), Market Intelligence (data platforms for investment research), Indices (benchmarking tools like the S&P 500), Commodity Insights (energy and commodity data), and Mobility (automotive market intelligence) [4]. The company operates primarily in the U.S. (60% of revenue), Europe (25%), and Asia-Pacific (10%), serving institutional investors, corporations, and governments [5].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
S&P Global leverages its integrated data ecosystem to maintain competitive edges, including proprietary datasets and AI-enhanced analytics that improve client decision-making [3]. The strategy focuses on expanding subscription revenues, which account for 80% of total, reducing cyclicality from transaction-based fees [1]. Recent investments in sustainability and ESG data align with regulatory demands, positioning the firm as a leader in emerging markets like carbon credit tracking [6].

Secular trends favor S&P Global, such as increasing demand for real-time data amid digital transformation and the energy transition. Medium-term outlook projects 7-9% annual revenue growth through 2027, supported by cross-selling opportunities post-2022 IHS Markit merger [4]. However, competition from Moody's and Bloomberg could pressure margins if innovation lags.

In the next 3-5 years, we anticipate margin expansion to 50% as synergies fully materialize, with AI integrations driving efficiency [1]. Geopolitical stability and interest rate normalization will be key to unlocking issuance volumes in Ratings.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
Bulls Say:  
1. S&P Global's oligopolistic position in credit ratings ensures high barriers to entry and stable cash flows [4].  
2. Growth in ESG and sustainability data segments taps into trillion-dollar markets driven by global regulations [6].  
3. Strong free cash flow generation supports dividends and buybacks, enhancing shareholder returns [2].  

Bears Say:  
1. Cyclical dependence on debt issuance volumes exposes revenue to economic downturns [1].  
2. Regulatory risks, including antitrust probes, could limit pricing power or force divestitures [8].  
3. Intense competition in data analytics from fintech disruptors may erode market share [7].

### Economic Moat
S&P Global possesses a wide economic moat primarily from intangible assets and network effects. In Ratings, regulatory requirements mandate the use of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, creating high switching costs and barriers that limit competition to a few players like Moody's [4]. Network effects are evident in Indices, where the S&P 500 benchmark is embedded in trillions of dollars of assets, reinforcing its indispensability [6]. Evidence includes average operating margins of 45% over the past five years and revenue retention rates above 95% in subscription businesses [1]. The 2022 IHS Markit acquisition bolstered data moats in Commodity Insights and Mobility, adding proprietary datasets that enhance cross-segment value [5].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our fair value estimate of $500 per share is derived from a discounted cash flow model projecting revenue CAGR of 8% from 2025-2029, driven by 10% growth in Market Intelligence and Indices, offset by 5% in Ratings amid issuance volatility [1]. We forecast operating margins expanding from 46% in 2025 to 50% by 2029 through cost synergies and scale efficiencies [3]. WACC is 8%, reflecting a beta of 1.0 and cost of equity at 9.5% [6].

EPS bridge starts at $14.50 in 2025 (up 10% YoY), reaching $22.00 by 2029 via revenue growth (+$1.50), margin gains (+$3.00), and share repurchases (+$3.00) [2]. This implies a 2025 P/E of 29x and EV/EBITDA of 18x, in line with peers [7]. Terminal growth is 3%, yielding a present value of $500.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macroeconomic slowdowns could reduce debt issuances, impacting 30% of revenue [1]. Regulatory risks include U.S. antitrust reviews of market concentration, potentially leading to fines or forced asset sales [8]. ESG-related risks involve data accuracy in sustainability reporting, with potential reputational damage from errors. Operational risks stem from cybersecurity threats to data platforms. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with a 20% valuation swing possible under adverse scenarios [6].

### Capital Allocation
S&P Global maintains a strong balance sheet with net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.5x and interest coverage above 10x [4]. M&A discipline is evident in the accretive IHS Markit deal, which has delivered $800 million in synergies [5]. The company returns 70% of FCF via dividends (yield 0.8%) and buybacks ($3 billion authorized in 2025) [2]. This prudent approach earns an exemplary rating.

### Analyst Note
Broadcom Inc. reported strong fiscal Q1 2025 results on March 6, 2025, with revenue reaching $14.916 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by robust demand in AI-related semiconductors [1]. Non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.60, up 45.5% from the prior year, exceeding consensus estimates of $1.51 [2]. AI revenue surged 77% to $4.1 billion, underscoring the company's positioning in high-growth data center and networking markets [3]. Infrastructure software revenue, bolstered by the VMware acquisition, grew 47% [4], contributing to an adjusted EBITDA of $10.083 billion, or 68% of revenue [5]. Management guided Q2 revenue to approximately $14.9 billion, aligning with expectations and signaling continued momentum [6].

This performance reinforces our thesis that Broadcom is well-placed to capitalize on secular AI adoption trends, with its custom ASIC and networking solutions providing a competitive edge amid hyperscaler investments. The VMware integration appears on track, enhancing recurring revenue streams in software, which now accounts for a larger portion of the mix. However, non-AI semiconductor segments showed softer growth at 11%, reflecting cyclical pressures in consumer and enterprise markets [4]. We maintain our wide moat rating, supported by high switching costs in semiconductor design and software ecosystems.

Looking ahead, we project fiscal 2025 revenue of $60 billion, implying 20% growth, with AI contributing over 30% of total revenue. Margins should expand to 66% adjusted EBITDA, driven by scale efficiencies and pricing power in AI chips [7]. Our fair value estimate of $200 per share assumes a 15% revenue CAGR through 2029, with WACC at 8.5%. At the current price of $180.50, the stock trades at a 10% discount to our FVE, presenting a buying opportunity. Risks include potential slowdowns in AI capex and geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains. Overall, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and AI exposure support a positive medium-term outlook, though investors should monitor enterprise spending trends.

### Business Description
Broadcom Inc. designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Key segments include Semiconductor Solutions, which encompasses networking, storage, broadband, wireless, and industrial chips, and Infrastructure Software, featuring enterprise software solutions following the 2023 VMware acquisition [8]. The company generates revenue globally, with approximately 40% from the Americas, 30% from Asia-Pacific excluding China, 20% from China, and 10% from Europe [9].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
Broadcom's strategy focuses on leveraging its leadership in high-performance semiconductors and software to address growing demands in AI, cloud computing, and data centers. The company invests heavily in R&D, with spending at 15% of revenue in Q1 2025 [1], to develop custom ASICs and optical components for AI accelerators. The VMware acquisition expands its software offerings, providing hybrid cloud solutions that generate stable subscription revenue, reducing cyclicality from hardware sales [8].

Secular trends such as AI proliferation and 5G/6G infrastructure buildouts favor Broadcom, as hyperscalers like Google and Meta increase spending on AI networking [10]. Medium-term, we expect AI-driven growth to offset weaknesses in non-AI areas, with revenue diversification mitigating risks from any single market.

Over the next 3-5 years, Broadcom aims for 15-20% annual revenue growth, supported by expanding market share in Ethernet switching and optical transceivers [7]. Challenges include competition from Nvidia in AI chips, but Broadcom's focus on complementary networking positions it well for sustained expansion.

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
- AI revenue growth of 77% in Q1 2025 highlights Broadcom's strong positioning in data center infrastructure, with potential for further upside as hyperscaler capex rises [3].  
- The VMware integration boosts recurring software revenue, providing stability and margin expansion [8].  
- Consistent dividend increases, up 14% quarterly in fiscal 2024, attract income-focused investors [11].  

**Bears Say**  
- Non-AI semiconductor revenue grew only 11% in Q1 2025, signaling vulnerability to economic slowdowns in consumer electronics [4].  
- High reliance on a few large customers, such as Apple and major cloud providers, introduces concentration risk [9].  
- Geopolitical tensions, including U.S.-China trade restrictions, could disrupt supply chains and revenue from Asia [12].

### Economic Moat
Broadcom maintains a wide economic moat, primarily sourced from high switching costs and intangible assets. Customers in networking and storage face significant barriers to switching suppliers due to the complexity of integrating custom ASICs, with redesign costs often exceeding $100 million per project [13]. Intangible assets include a vast patent portfolio of over 20,000 entries, protecting innovations in AI and 5G technologies [14]. Evidence includes sustained gross margins above 75% in semiconductors, reflecting pricing power [1]. Scale advantages from $50 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue enable R&D investments that smaller peers cannot match [11].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model projects a fair value of $200 per share. We forecast revenue CAGR of 15% from fiscal 2025 to 2029, driven by 25% growth in AI semiconductors and 10% in software, reaching $100 billion by 2029 [based on Q1 trends and guidance [1][6]]. Operating margins expand from 40% in 2024 to 45% by 2029, fueled by software mix and efficiencies, yielding EPS growth from $5.50 in 2024 to $12.00 in 2029.

We apply an 8.5% WACC, reflecting a 6% risk-free rate, 5% equity risk premium, and beta of 1.1 [15]. The EPS bridge starts at $5.50 (2024 actual), adds $2.00 from revenue growth, $1.50 from margin expansion, subtracts $0.50 for higher taxes, netting $8.50 in 2026. Terminal growth is 4%, implying a 25x P/E multiple on 2029 EPS, consistent with peers.

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include a potential slowdown in AI capital spending, which could reduce demand for networking chips; a 10% cut in hyperscaler budgets might shave 5% off our revenue forecast [10]. Regulatory risks involve antitrust scrutiny on acquisitions and U.S. export controls to China, impacting 20% of revenue [12]. ESG risks center on supply chain emissions and labor practices in Asia. Operational risks include semiconductor cyclicality and supply disruptions from Taiwan-based manufacturing. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with fair value potentially ranging ±20%.

### Capital Allocation
Broadcom exhibits exemplary capital allocation, with a strong balance sheet showing $10 billion in net cash and debt-to-EBITDA below 2x post-VMware [1]. M&A discipline is evident in the $69 billion VMware deal, which has driven 47% software growth [8]. The company maintains a progressive dividend policy, with Q1 2025 payout at $5.25 per share, yielding 3%, and consistent buybacks averaging $5 billion annually [11]. Free cash flow of 51% of revenue supports these initiatives without straining liquidity [11].

### ESG Risk
Based on Sustainalytics data, Broadcom scores 18.5 (low risk) on ESG metrics, outperforming the semiconductor peer average of 22.0 [16]. Key material issues include carbon emissions from manufacturing (Scope 1 and 2 at 500,000 tons CO2e annually) and human capital management in supply chains [16]. The company targets net-zero emissions by 2050, with 50% renewable energy usage in 2024 [17].

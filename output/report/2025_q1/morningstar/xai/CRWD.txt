### Analyst Note
CrowdStrike Holdings reported strong fiscal year 2025 results, with ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) reaching $4.24 billion, up 23% year over year, and net new ARR of $224 million in the fourth quarter [1]. Full-year subscription revenue grew 31% to $3.76 billion, driven by robust demand for its Falcon platform amid rising cyber threats [1]. The company achieved record operating cash flow of $1.38 billion and free cash flow of $1.07 billion, reflecting efficient operations and a subscription gross margin of approximately 78% in prior quarters [1][2]. Third-quarter results, which contributed to the annual figures, showed ARR of $4.02 billion (up 27%) and quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time, at $1.01 billion (up 29%) [3]. These metrics underscore CrowdStrike's leadership in endpoint and cloud security, with AI-powered threat detection enabling faster response times compared to peers.

Our thesis remains intact: CrowdStrike benefits from secular growth in cybersecurity spending, projected to increase at a 12% CAGR through 2028 due to escalating ransomware and state-sponsored attacks [4]. However, the third-quarter net new ARR declined 31% year over year to $153 million, signaling potential sales cycle elongation post a global outage in July 2024 that affected customers [3][5]. Management highlighted recovery efforts, including expanded module adoption, with customers using eight or more modules rising to 27% [1]. We view this as temporary, supported by the acquisition of Flow Security to bolster data protection capabilities [6].

We maintain our wide moat rating, driven by switching costs and network effects from the Falcon platform's integrated modules. Our fair value estimate of $450 implies a forward P/E of 80x our fiscal 2026 EPS forecast, reasonable given 25% revenue CAGR expectations. High uncertainty stems from competitive pressures and macroeconomic sensitivity. Overall, CRWD appears undervalued at current levels, with upside from platform consolidation trends.

### Business Description
CrowdStrike Holdings provides cloud-native cybersecurity solutions through its Falcon platform, which offers endpoint protection, threat intelligence, cloud workload security, identity protection, and managed detection and response (MDR) services [1]. Key segments include subscription revenue (accounting for over 95% of total), derived from multi-module adoption, and professional services [1]. The company operates globally, with approximately 60% of revenue from the U.S. and the remainder from international markets including Europe and Asia-Pacific [7]. As of fiscal 2025, CrowdStrike served over 11,000 subscription customers, including a majority of Fortune 100 companies [2].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
CrowdStrike's strategy centers on its single-agent, AI-driven Falcon platform, which consolidates multiple security tools into one ecosystem, reducing complexity for customers compared to legacy point solutions [1]. The company invests heavily in R&D, with AI and machine learning enabling proactive threat hunting; for instance, its Charlotte AI tool automates investigations, cutting response times [5]. Expansion into adjacent areas like cloud security and MDR has driven cross-selling, with average modules per customer increasing to over 5 in fiscal 2025 [1].

Secular trends favor CrowdStrike, as global cyber incidents rose 20% in 2024, per industry reports, boosting demand for next-gen solutions [4]. The shift to cloud and remote work amplifies needs for zero-trust architectures, where CrowdStrike excels. Medium-term, we expect revenue growth of 20-25% annually through fiscal 2029, supported by ARR expansion and net retention rates above 120% [1][3]. However, competition from players like Palo Alto Networks and Microsoft could pressure pricing.

Looking ahead, CrowdStrike aims for $10 billion in ARR by 2030, leveraging partnerships and acquisitions to enhance its portfolio [1]. We anticipate margin expansion from scale, with non-GAAP operating margins reaching 25-30% by fiscal 2027, though near-term headwinds from the 2024 outage may slow net new ARR recovery [3].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. CrowdStrike's AI-powered platform drives high customer retention and upsell, with net retention rates consistently above 120% [3].  
2. Secular cybersecurity spending growth, fueled by rising threats, positions CRWD for sustained 20%+ revenue CAGR [4].  
3. Strong cash flow generation ($1.07 billion FCF in FY2025) supports M&A and innovation without diluting shareholders [1].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Intense competition from integrated suites like Microsoft's Defender could erode market share and pressure pricing [5].  
2. The July 2024 global outage damaged reputation, leading to elongated sales cycles and a 31% drop in Q3 net new ARR [3].  
3. High valuation multiples (over 80x forward EPS) leave little room for error amid economic slowdowns [6].

### Economic Moat
We assign CrowdStrike a wide economic moat, primarily from switching costs and intangible assets. The Falcon platform's deep integration into customer IT environments creates high barriers to exit; migrating data and retraining teams would incur significant time and cost, evidenced by net retention rates exceeding 120% [3]. Network effects amplify this, as more users contribute threat data to the platform's AI models, improving efficacy for all—CrowdStrike processes over 2 trillion events daily, far surpassing smaller peers [1]. Intangible assets include proprietary AI algorithms and threat intelligence, protected by patents, enabling superior detection rates [5]. These sources have sustained 30%+ revenue growth and gross margins above 75%, outpacing industry averages [2].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our discounted cash flow model assumes a 25% revenue CAGR from fiscal 2025 to 2029, slowing to 10% terminal growth, driven by ARR expansion to $8 billion by 2029 and module adoption growth [1]. We project non-GAAP operating margins expanding from 1% in FY2025 to 30% by 2029, reflecting scale efficiencies and reduced sales costs [3]. WACC is 10%, incorporating high beta (1.4) and equity risk premium [8]. EPS bridges from $3.50 in FY2025 to $10.00 in FY2029 via revenue growth (+$6.00), margin expansion (+$2.00), and share buybacks (+$0.50), offset by higher taxes (-$1.00). This yields a fair value of $450, implying 80x FY2026 EPS and 12x EV/sales, aligned with growth peers.

### Risk & Uncertainty
High uncertainty arises from operational risks, such as software outages like the July 2024 incident that disrupted global operations and led to lawsuits [5]. Competitive risks include encroachment by hyperscalers like Microsoft, potentially commoditizing endpoint security. Macroeconomic slowdowns could reduce IT budgets, impacting ARR growth [3]. Regulatory risks involve data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and potential antitrust scrutiny on M&A. ESG factors include cyber breach risks, which could harm reputation. These could swing valuation by 30%.

### Capital Allocation
CrowdStrike maintains a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion in cash and minimal debt as of FY2025, supporting exemplary capital allocation [1]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted deals like Flow Security to enhance cloud data protection without overpaying [6]. The company prioritizes reinvestment in growth over dividends, with no current payout policy, but uses excess cash for opportunistic buybacks ($500 million authorized in FY2025) [1]. ROIC exceeds 20%, reflecting efficient capital use [1]. Rating: Exemplary.

No major controversies noted, though the 2024 outage highlighted operational resilience needs.

### Analyst Note
ServiceNow Inc. reported its Q1 2025 financial results on April 23, 2025, highlighting continued growth in its core subscription business amid a challenging macroeconomic environment [1]. Revenue increased 19% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its AI-integrated workflow platforms, while remaining performance obligations rose 25%, signaling robust future revenue visibility [2]. Earnings per share grew 32%, benefiting from operational efficiencies and margin expansion [2]. These results underscore ServiceNow's resilience, with subscription revenues forming the bulk of total revenue, reflecting the company's shift toward AI-driven solutions for enterprise transformation [1].

The thesis for ServiceNow remains intact: as a leader in digital workflow automation, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on secular trends in AI and cloud adoption. Q1 performance exceeded expectations in key metrics, with current remaining performance obligations indicating sustained demand from large enterprises [3]. However, growth moderated slightly from prior quarters, potentially due to elongated sales cycles in a high-interest-rate environment. The stock rose approximately 9% in after-hours trading following the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in the company's AI roadmap [2].

Looking ahead, we maintain our wide moat rating, supported by high switching costs and network effects in ServiceNow's platform. Our fair value estimate of $900 per share implies a forward P/E multiple of about 45x our 2026 EPS forecast, which we view as justified given projected revenue CAGR of 20% through 2029. Key highlights include expanding AI capabilities, such as generative AI tools integrated into the Now Platform, which contributed to deal wins in IT service management and customer workflows [1]. Risks include intensified competition from peers like Salesforce and Microsoft, but ServiceNow's focus on niche enterprise applications provides differentiation. Overall, the Q1 results reinforce our positive outlook, with medium-term growth driven by digital transformation tailwinds and improving margins targeting 20% by 2029.

### Business Description
ServiceNow Inc. provides cloud-based platforms for automating enterprise workflows, primarily through its Now Platform [1]. The company offers solutions in IT service management, customer service, human resources, security operations, and application development. Key segments include subscription services (over 95% of revenue) and professional services [3]. Geographically, operations are global, with approximately 60% of revenue from North America, 25% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and the remainder from Asia-Pacific [6].

### Business Strategy & Outlook
ServiceNow's competitive edge stems from its unified platform that integrates AI and machine learning to streamline business processes, reducing complexity for enterprises [1]. The company invests heavily in R&D, with a focus on generative AI features to enhance automation and decision-making, positioning it as a key player in business transformation [1]. This strategy includes partnerships and acquisitions to expand ecosystem capabilities, such as recent integrations with government AI initiatives [5].

Secular trends favoring ServiceNow include accelerating digitalization, cloud migration, and AI adoption across industries, driving demand for workflow optimization [6]. In the medium term, we expect revenue growth to remain in the high teens to low twenties annually, supported by an expanding customer base of over 1,900 clients with $1M+ annual contract value [7].

Challenges include macroeconomic headwinds, but ServiceNow's recurring revenue model provides stability. Outlook remains positive, with potential for margin expansion through scale and cost controls [3].

### Bulls Say / Bears Say
**Bulls Say**  
1. Strong subscription growth and high retention rates indicate sticky customer relationships, with AI enhancements driving upsell opportunities [1].  
2. Expansion into new verticals like public sector AI partnerships could accelerate revenue diversification [5].  
3. Robust remaining performance obligations suggest visibility into sustained 20%+ growth [2].  

**Bears Say**  
1. Moderating growth rates from prior years may signal saturation in core markets amid economic uncertainty [2].  
2. High valuation multiples leave little room for error if competition from Microsoft or Salesforce intensifies [6].  
3. Dependence on large enterprise deals exposes the company to elongated sales cycles [3].  

### Economic Moat
ServiceNow earns a wide economic moat primarily from switching costs and intangible assets. High switching costs arise from deep integration of the Now Platform into clients' operations, making migration to competitors costly and disruptive [7]. Evidence includes customer retention rates exceeding 98% and an average contract length of over three years [4]. Intangible assets, such as proprietary AI algorithms and a vast ecosystem of applications, create network effects, as more users enhance platform value [1]. This moat is evidenced by consistent market share gains in enterprise service management, with over 85% of Fortune 500 companies as clients [6].

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers
Our fair value estimate of $900 per share is derived from a discounted cash flow model assuming a 20% revenue CAGR from 2025 to 2029, driven by subscription growth and AI adoption [Appendix]. We project operating margins expanding from 10% in 2024 to 20% by 2029 through scale efficiencies and reduced sales costs. WACC is set at 8.5%, reflecting the company's beta of 1.1 and cost of equity [Appendix].

EPS bridge: Starting from 2024 EPS of $10.00, we add $2.00 from revenue growth, $0.40 from margin expansion, offset by $0.40 in higher taxes and share dilution, yielding 2025 EPS of $12.00 [model-derived]. This implies a 2026 P/E of 40x at fair value. Terminal value assumes 4% perpetual growth, contributing 60% to enterprise value of $184B; subtracting net cash of $4B yields equity value of $188B, divided by 209M diluted shares [Appendix].

### Risk & Uncertainty
Macro risks include economic downturns reducing IT spending, potentially impacting deal sizes [2]. Regulatory risks involve data privacy laws like GDPR, which could increase compliance costs [6]. ESG risks center on data security breaches, given the platform's handling of sensitive information [12]. Operational risks include competition eroding market share and talent retention in tech. These factors contribute to medium uncertainty, with a potential 20-30% swing in fair value from base case.

### Capital Allocation
ServiceNow maintains a strong balance sheet with net cash of approximately $4B and low debt levels, supporting flexibility for investments [3]. M&A discipline is evident in targeted acquisitions to bolster AI capabilities, avoiding overpayment [4]. The company does not pay dividends but engages in modest share buybacks, prioritizing growth. This approach earns a standard capital allocation rating.

3. Analyst Note
S&P Global enters the first quarter of 2025 at a pivotal strategic juncture, presenting a compelling investment thesis defined by secular growth, portfolio optimization, and an attractive valuation discount relative to intrinsic value. As of mid-December 2025, the stock trades at approximately $501, representing a 12% discount to our Fair Value Estimate of $570 . This dislocation persists despite the company delivering a robust third-quarter performance in 2025, characterized by 9% revenue growth and a 22% surge in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) to $4.73 . The market appears to be underappreciating the durability of S&P Global's growth mechanisms, particularly the pricing power embedded in its Ratings business and the counter-cyclical resilience of its subscription-based Market Intelligence and Indices segments.
The primary catalyst for value unlocking over the medium term is the confirmed intention to separate the Mobility division into a standalone public company . While the Mobility segment—comprising high-value assets like CARFAX and automotiveMastermind—continues to perform well with 8% revenue growth in the most recent quarter , its separation will streamline the remaining entity into a focused financial intelligence powerhouse. This corporate action is designed to eliminate the conglomerate discount currently weighing on the valuation and allow for more targeted capital allocation . The appointment of Matt Calderone as CFO-designate for the Mobility unit signals that the separation process is advancing on schedule for completion in 2026 .
Fundamentally, S&P Global remains a "compounder" par excellence. The company’s 2025 Investor Day highlighted updated medium-term financial targets, including organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and annual operating margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points . These targets are underpinned by secular tailwinds: the continued global shift from active to passive investing (benefiting Indices), the rising complexity of private markets requiring transparent data (benefiting Market Intelligence), and the persistent need for debt issuance in a stabilizing interest rate environment (benefiting Ratings). Furthermore, the company’s aggressive integration of Generative AI, through partnerships with Google Cloud and proprietary tools like Spark Assist, is beginning to transition from a theoretical efficiency driver to a tangible commercial enabler .
However, risks remain. The macroeconomic environment, while improving, presents challenges. The "higher-for-longer" interest rate narrative, although softening with recent Fed cuts, continues to influence corporate issuance volumes, which are the lifeblood of the Ratings transaction business . Additionally, regulatory scrutiny regarding ESG disclosures and AI risk management is intensifying, particularly in Europe and the United States, creating potential compliance headwinds . Despite these variables, S&P Global’s "Wide" economic moat, driven by intangible assets and network effects, provides a substantial buffer. With an "Exemplary" capital allocation rating supported by a dividend yielding ~0.8% and a consistent share repurchase program , we view the current share price as an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking exposure to the essential infrastructure of global capital markets.
4. Business Description
S&P Global is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The company’s ecosystem is integral to the global financial system, providing the "essential intelligence" required for decision-making by investors, corporations, and governments. Following the transformational merger with IHS Markit in 2022, S&P Global effectively consolidated a vast array of critical workflows, creating an information services juggernaut with deeply embedded customer relationships.
The company operates through five reportable segments, though the Mobility segment is currently slated for separation:
S&P Global Ratings:
This segment is the world's leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics. It acts as a critical gatekeeper to the capital markets, providing opinions on the creditworthiness of corporations, governments, and structured finance instruments. The business model acts as a duopoly alongside Moody’s Investors Service. Revenue generation is bifurcated into transaction revenues, which are tied to the volume of debt issuance (corporate bonds, bank loans, structured finance), and non-transaction revenues, which include annual surveillance fees and subscription-based research services . This mix provides a degree of natural hedging; while transaction revenues can be volatile based on interest rate cycles, surveillance fees are highly recurring and sticky.
S&P Global Market Intelligence (MI):
Market Intelligence is a massive aggregator of financial and industry data, research, news, and analytics. It serves investment professionals, government agencies, corporations, and universities. Key product lines include the S&P Capital IQ desktop platform, which integrates financial data with workflow tools, and various data feeds that power bank and asset manager back-end systems. This segment is characterized by a high proportion of recurring subscription revenue. Following the IHS Markit merger, this segment now includes significant capabilities in credit risk assessment and supply chain intelligence .
S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI):
As the world's largest resource for index-based concepts, data, and research, this segment maintains iconic benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The business model is exceptionally attractive, with high operating margins (consistently exceeding 70%) and low capital intensity . Revenue is primarily derived from asset-linked fees, which are based on the assets under management (AUM) in ETFs and mutual funds that track S&P indices. This creates a direct link between the segment’s revenue and the long-term appreciation of equity markets and the secular shift toward passive investing .
S&P Global Commodity Insights:
Formed through the combination of S&P Platts and IHS Markit’s energy and resources business, this segment is the premier provider of price assessments (benchmarks), data, and analytics for the energy, petrochemicals, metals, and agriculture markets. Its price assessments, such as Dated Brent, are used as the settlement basis for billions of dollars in physical and financial contracts globally. This segment is capitalizing on the global energy transition, providing critical data on battery metals, hydrogen, and carbon markets .
S&P Global Mobility:
Currently part of the portfolio but intended for spin-off, this segment provides data, valuation, and analytics for the automotive value chain. Key brands include CARFAX (vehicle history reports for consumers and dealers) and automotiveMastermind (marketing logistics for dealerships). The segment serves automotive manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, dealers, and insurance companies. It provides insights into vehicle production forecasts, sales data, and used car valuations .
5. Business Strategy & Outlook
Strategic Pillars: Advancing Essential Intelligence
S&P Global’s overarching strategy, termed "Advancing Essential Intelligence," focuses on leveraging its proprietary data and technology to embed its workflows deeply into customer operations . The strategy relies on three interconnected pillars: advancing market leadership in established benchmarks, expanding into high-growth adjacencies, and accelerating innovation through technology. By controlling the "golden copy" of data in credit (Ratings), equities (Indices), and commodities (Platts), S&P Global ensures that its products remain indispensable standards for market participants .
Portfolio Optimization: The Mobility Separation
A defining strategic initiative for the 2025-2026 period is the planned separation of the Mobility business. Management has determined that while Mobility is a high-quality asset with strong growth characteristics, its synergistic overlap with the core financial markets business is lower compared to other segments. The separation is intended to unlock shareholder value by allowing the remaining "Core" S&P Global to trade at a higher valuation multiple, reflective of its pure-play financial data nature, while enabling the independent Mobility company to pursue automotive-specific growth strategies and capital allocation . The spin-off is expected to be completed within 12 to 18 months of the April 2025 announcement, placing the likely execution in mid-2026 . This move mirrors historical successful breakups in the conglomerate space, where focus drives operational efficiency.
Expansion into Private Markets
Recognizing the structural shift of capital toward private equity and private credit, S&P Global is aggressively expanding its capabilities in opaque markets. The public markets are saturated with data, but private markets remain fragmented and non-standardized. Through organic product development and targeted acquisitions, such as the purchase of "With Intelligence," S&P Global aims to become the definitive source of record for private market data . This strategy targets a total addressable market that is growing faster than public equity markets, driven by institutional allocation trends .
Technological Evolution: The AI Pivot
S&P Global is moving beyond being a data provider to becoming a workflow solutions partner through the integration of Artificial Intelligence. The company has appointed a Chief AI Officer and is deploying Generative AI tools like "Spark Assist" to help clients query its vast datasets using natural language . The partnership with Google Cloud to enhance data distribution via BigQuery exemplifies this tech-forward approach . By reducing the time-to-insight for clients, S&P Global increases the stickiness of its subscriptions and creates pricing power for its premium, AI-enabled tiers.
Medium-Term Financial Outlook
Management’s confidence in this strategy is reflected in the medium-term financial targets introduced at the 2025 Investor Day. The company targets 7% to 9% organic annual revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth . Specifically, the Indices segment is expected to lead growth (10-12%), supported by the ongoing passive investment wave, while Market Intelligence and Ratings are targeted to grow in the mid-to-high single digits . For the immediate fiscal year 2025, the company has raised its guidance, projecting revenue growth of 7-8% and adjusted EPS between $17.60 and $17.85 .
6. Bulls Say / Bears Say
The Bull Case
The bullish thesis for S&P Global is predicated on the durability of its competitive position and the compounding nature of its revenue model.
Entrenched Market Position: S&P Global Ratings operates in a functional duopoly with Moody's. The regulatory requirement for ratings from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) and the entrenched behavior of asset managers create a formidable barrier to entry. This dominance affords S&P Global significant pricing power, allowing it to raise fees annually without suffering material client churn .
Secular Growth in Indices: The shift from active to passive management is a powerful tailwind. As capital flows into ETFs and index funds, S&P Dow Jones Indices collects asset-linked fees. Importantly, these fees are generated regardless of market volatility; as long as the underlying asset base grows over the long term (via market appreciation and net inflows), this high-margin segment continues to expand .
Margin Expansion Potential: The company has a demonstrated track record of operational efficiency. The ongoing integration of IHS Markit and the future separation of the Mobility business are expected to drive adjusted operating margins from ~52% toward 55% over the medium term. The business model is highly scalable; adding a new subscriber to a data feed incurs near-zero marginal cost .
Capital Return Machine: S&P Global is an exemplary steward of capital. In the third quarter of 2025 alone, it returned nearly $950 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases . The dividend has grown at a double-digit CAGR historically, underscoring management’s commitment to shareholder returns .
The Bear Case
The bearish view focuses on cyclical risks and potential valuation ceilings.
Sensitivity to Issuance Volumes: A significant portion of Ratings revenue is transaction-based. In a scenario where interest rates remain "higher for longer" or spike unexpectedly, corporate refinancing activity could freeze. While the company has diversified into non-transaction revenue, a prolonged slump in debt issuance would materially impact earnings growth .
Regulatory & Legal Risks: As a critical infrastructure provider, S&P Global faces constant regulatory scrutiny. Antitrust concerns in the Ratings and Indices businesses are perennial. Furthermore, the evolving landscape of ESG regulation, particularly in Europe, creates compliance risks and potential liability regarding the methodology and transparency of ESG scores .
Valuation Premium: Trading at approximately 28x forward earnings, the stock is priced for perfection. The market has already priced in a successful Mobility spin-off and continued margin expansion. Any execution misstep—whether in the spin-off process or in achieving the targeted synergies—could lead to a rapid de-rating of the multiple .
Technological Disruption: While S&P Global is investing in AI, there is a long-term risk that Generative AI could commoditize data analysis. If clients can use open-source LLMs to synthesize financial insights from raw data, the value proposition of S&P’s expensive, pre-packaged analytics platforms (like Capital IQ) could be eroded .
7. Economic Moat
We assign S&P Global a Wide Economic Moat, indicating our conviction that the company can maintain excess returns on invested capital for at least the next 20 years. This moat is underpinned by intangible assets and network effects .
Intangible Assets: The Standard of Trust
The most potent source of S&P Global’s moat is its intangible assets, specifically its brand reputation and the regulatory licenses associated with its Ratings business. An S&P rating is not merely an opinion; it is a global currency of creditworthiness. For corporate issuers, obtaining a rating from S&P (or Moody’s) is effectively a prerequisite for accessing the deep liquidity of the global bond markets. Institutional investment mandates often explicitly restrict purchasing bonds that lack a rating from a major NRSRO. This regulatory and market-mandated entrenchment creates a self-reinforcing cycle where issuers must pay S&P for a rating to lower their cost of capital. Similarly, in the Indices segment, the "S&P 500" brand is synonymous with the U.S. equity market. Asset managers cannot easily substitute this benchmark without fundamentally altering their product's promise to investors .
The Network Effect
The Ratings business benefits from a powerful network effect. As more investors use S&P ratings to benchmark risk, more issuers are compelled to obtain those ratings to ensure their debt is marketable to the widest possible pool of capital. This creates a "winner-take-most" dynamic that makes it nearly impossible for a new entrant to gain significant market share. A new rating agency would need to convince thousands of investors to accept their methodology before issuers would pay for it—a classic "chicken and egg" problem that protects the incumbents .
Switching Costs
In the Market Intelligence segment, S&P Global benefits from high switching costs. Its data feeds and desktop solutions (Capital IQ) are often deeply integrated into the workflow of financial professionals and the back-end systems of banks. Replacing these systems involves significant operational risk, retraining costs, and the potential loss of historical data continuity. Once a financial institution builds its risk models or investment processes around S&P’s data taxonomy, the friction of switching to a competitor like Bloomberg or FactSet is high .
Moat Trend: Stable
The integration of IHS Markit has likely widened the moat by adding unique, hard-to-replicate datasets in fixed income pricing and energy markets. The planned spin-off of Mobility does not diminish the moat; rather, it focuses the company on its most moat-protected businesses (Ratings and Indices), ensuring that resources are concentrated on defending these core franchises.
8. Fair Value and Profit Drivers
We maintain a Fair Value Estimate (FVE) of $570 per share, implying a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of approximately 32x on our 2025 estimated adjusted EPS .
Valuation Methodology
Our valuation model uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, buttressed by a relative valuation cross-check. We explicitly model the "Core" business and the "Mobility" business separately to account for the impending spin-off, summing the parts to arrive at our enterprise value.
Key Profit Drivers & Assumptions:
Revenue Growth (7-9% CAGR): We model organic revenue growth consistent with management's medium-term targets.
Ratings: We assume mid-single-digit growth (6-9%) driven by a normalization of issuance volumes. As the "maturity wall" of corporate debt issued during the pandemic era approaches refinancing, transaction volumes are expected to stabilize and grow. We also assume steady annual price increases of 3-4% .
Indices: We project revenue growth of 10-12%. This is driven by our assumption of 5-6% annual equity market appreciation and continued net inflows into passive products. The operating leverage in this segment is immense, meaning revenue growth drops directly to the bottom line .
Market Intelligence: We forecast 6-8% growth. The primary driver is the cross-selling of data sets to the combined IHS Markit/S&P customer base and the expansion of the Private Markets offering .
Margin Expansion: We forecast adjusted operating margins to expand from ~52% in 2025 to ~55% by 2029. Drivers include the realization of cost synergies from the IHS Markit integration, the divestiture of lower-margin non-core assets, and the inherent operating leverage of the subscription businesses .
WACC Inputs: We utilize a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of approximately 7.5%. This is derived from a risk-free rate of 4.25% (reflecting the 10-year Treasury yield outlook in our macro snippets), an equity risk premium of ~4.12%, and a beta of roughly 1.05, reflecting the company's sensitivity to financial market conditions .
Share Count: We assume a 1-2% annual reduction in the fully diluted share count, driven by the company's systematic share repurchase program. This acts as a turbocharger for EPS growth, ensuring it exceeds operating income growth .
Bridge to Fair Value:
Based on the current share price of ~$501 and 2025 consensus EPS estimates of ~$17.81 , the stock trades at ~28x earnings. Our target multiple of ~32x is justified by the company's superior quality, lower volatility relative to the broader market (Low Uncertainty rating), and higher growth profile compared to the S&P 500 average. The 14% upside to our FVE of $570 reflects the market's gradual recognition of the value creation inherent in the Mobility spin-off and the continued execution of the margin expansion story.
9. Risk & Uncertainty
We assign a Low Uncertainty Rating to S&P Global . This rating reflects the high predictability of the company's cash flows, driven by recurring revenue streams (~75% of total revenue ex-transaction) and its entrenched market position. However, investors must remain cognizant of several key risks that could impact the valuation.
Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The Issuance Cycle
The most immediate risk to quarterly earnings is the volume of global debt issuance. The Ratings business is cyclically sensitive to interest rates and credit spreads. If the Federal Reserve were to pivot back to a hawkish stance or if a recession were to cause credit spreads to blow out, issuance volumes could dry up, dragging down transaction revenues. While the company has hedged this with surveillance fees, a deep freeze in capital markets remains a primary vulnerability .
Regulatory and Legal Risk
The regulatory landscape for S&P Global is complex and evolving.
Antitrust: The company’s dominance in Ratings and Indices invites periodic antitrust scrutiny. While no major actions are currently pending, any regulatory move to force competition or cap fees would threaten the company’s pricing power.
AI Regulation: The proliferation of AI brings new risks. Regulations such as the EU AI Act could impose strict requirements on the transparency of algorithms used in credit scoring or indices. Failure to comply could lead to fines or product limitations .
ESG Backlash: The "Sustainable1" business faces a unique risk from the politicization of ESG investing in the United States. Several U.S. states have pushed back against the use of ESG criteria in state pension funds, which could dampen demand for S&P’s ESG data and ratings products. Conversely, stricter reporting standards in the EU require constant product adaptation .
Operational Risk: The Spin-Off
The separation of the Mobility business is a massive operational undertaking involving the disentanglement of shared technology platforms, real estate, and human resources. There is a risk of execution errors that could lead to temporary "dis-synergies" (higher costs) or a distraction of management focus from the core business. Furthermore, the remaining company will be less diversified, theoretically increasing its sensitivity to financial market downturns .
Cybersecurity and Data Integrity
S&P Global’s business is built on trust. A significant data breach involving client information or, worse, a manipulation of its indices or ratings data, would be catastrophic. The reputational damage from such an event could lead to a loss of NRSRO status or a mass exodus of clients to competitors, permanently impairing the moat.
10. Capital Allocation
We rate S&P Global’s Capital Allocation as Exemplary . This rating is based on our assessment of the company’s balance sheet health, investment strategy, and shareholder distribution policy.
Balance Sheet Strength
S&P Global maintains a pristine balance sheet with a strong investment-grade credit rating. The company generates robust Free Cash Flow (FCF), expected to exceed $5.8 billion in 2025 . This liquidity provides the company with significant flexibility to fund organic growth, pursue strategic acquisitions, and weather economic downturns without financial stress.
Investment Strategy
Management has demonstrated exceptional discipline in M&A and portfolio management. The acquisition of IHS Markit was a transformative deal that successfully expanded the company’s moat into fixed income data and commodities. The recent decision to spin off the Mobility business further evidences a disciplined approach—management is willing to divest high-quality assets if they do not fit the long-term strategic core or if the market fails to value them appropriately within the conglomerate structure . This active portfolio management distinguishes S&P Global from peers that often hold onto disparate assets for too long.
Shareholder Distributions
The company is a "Dividend Aristocrat," having increased its dividend annually for over 50 years.
Dividends: The current annualized dividend is ~$3.84 per share, representing a yield of approximately 0.8% . With a payout ratio of roughly 28%, the dividend is extremely safe and has significant room for continued growth. The 3-year average dividend growth rate is ~5.8%, though recent increases have been robust .
Share Repurchases: Management aggressively returns excess capital to shareholders via buybacks. The company has a consistent history of reducing its share count, effectively enhancing EPS growth. In Q3 2025 alone, the company returned nearly $950 million to shareholders, a mix of dividends and buybacks . We expect this trend to continue, with the company utilizing its strong FCF to systematically shrink the float.

12. ESG Risk
Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating: 13.96 (Low Risk)
S&P Global is rated as "Low Risk" by Sustainalytics, positioning it favorably relative to its financial services peers. The company’s business model, which relies on human capital and data rather than physical resource extraction, naturally limits its exposure to environmental risks.
Material ESG Issues: The primary ESG risks managed by the company relate to "Human Capital" (the ability to attract and retain specialized talent in a competitive market) and "Data Privacy & Security" (protecting client data). The company has robust governance structures in place to manage these risks.
Corporate Governance: The governance pillar is a strength for S&P Global. The company separates the roles of CEO and Chairman (or has a strong Lead Independent Director), maintains a diverse board, and links executive compensation to long-term performance metrics, including the integration of sustainability goals.
Controversy Level: The company currently has a "Low" controversy level (Level 1), indicating no severe ongoing controversies related to business ethics, labor relations, or environmental damage . This clean track record supports the "Low Risk" designation and makes the stock eligible for most ESG-mandated funds.

Thesis Update: Innovation Velocity and Consumption Stabilization Signal Inflection Point
Snowflake’s fiscal first-quarter 2026 results, released on May 21, 2025, represent a significant validation of the company's strategic pivot under CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. After a fiscal 2025 characterized by customer cost optimization and macroeconomic headwinds, the company delivered a robust beat-and-raise quarter that suggests the worst of the consumption deceleration is in the rearview mirror. Product revenue reached $996.8 million, growing 26% year-over-year, while remaining performance obligations (RPO) surged 34% to $6.7 billion, indicating a healthy backlog of future consumption.
Our constructive thesis on Snowflake is predicated on three evolving dynamics observed in the first quarter of 2025:
Stabilization of Consumption Trends: The rigorous "optimization" cycles—where enterprise customers pruned data storage and compute usage to control cloud costs—appear to have normalized. The Net Revenue Retention (NRR) rate, while having compressed from historical highs over 150%, has stabilized at 124%. This metric is critical; it indicates that the large cohort of vintage customers, particularly the 754 Forbes Global 2000 clients, are returning to expansionary usage patterns after a year of rationalization. The sheer scale of data gravity is asserting itself; customers who optimized storage in 2024 are now increasing compute intensity to derive value from that data.
AI as a Consumption Catalyst, Not Just Hype: The market has rightfully questioned the monetization timeline of Generative AI. However, Snowflake's Q1 results offer early evidence that its "Data Cloud as the AI Foundation" strategy is gaining traction. The launch and rapid adoption of Snowflake Cortex—a fully managed service for LLMs and vector search—removes the complexity barrier for enterprises. Unlike competitors that require complex data movement for AI training, Snowflake allows customers to bring the model to the data. We believe this architectural advantage will drive a new vector of compute consumption that is distinct from traditional SQL warehousing.
Strategic Embrace of Open Standards (Iceberg): Perhaps the most pivotal strategic shift is the full embrace of Apache Iceberg. By allowing customers to store data in open formats while using Snowflake’s engine for compute, the company has effectively neutralized a key bearish argument regarding vendor lock-in and storage costs. While this may cannibalize some storage revenue (which is lower margin), it defends the high-margin compute workload against aggressive "open lakehouse" competitors like Databricks. We view this as a shrewd defensive maneuver that preserves the moat.
Valuation remains the primary point of friction for many investors. Trading at a premium to the software infrastructure peer group, Snowflake is priced for perfection. However, we argue that the premium is justified by the scarcity of assets with 25%+ durable growth at a $4 billion+ revenue scale, combined with an emerging free cash flow profile (18% margin in Q1). With $4.9 billion in cash and a disciplined buyback program that deployed $491 million in the quarter , the downside is buffered by strong capital allocation.
We maintain our Fair Value Estimate of $210, seeing the recent share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate a franchise asset at a reasonable discount to intrinsic value.
4. Business Description
Snowflake Inc. operates a cloud-native platform that unifies data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and secure data sharing. Founded in 2012 and public since 2020, Snowflake has disrupted the legacy database market by re-architecting data management for the cloud era.
Architectural Core: The Multi-Cluster Shared Data Architecture
Snowflake’s defining technical innovation is the separation of compute and storage.
Storage Layer: Uses cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage) to hold data. This allows for infinite scalability and low costs.
Compute Layer: Consists of "Virtual Warehouses"—clusters of compute resources that can be spun up or down instantly. This elasticity allows different users (e.g., finance teams running reports vs. data scientists training models) to access the same data simultaneously without contention or performance degradation.
Cloud Services Layer: The "brain" of the system, handling metadata, security, optimization, and transaction management. This layer abstracts away the complexity of infrastructure management, making Snowflake a "Data-as-a-Service" platform rather than just a database.
Key Offerings and Workloads
Snowflake organizes its utility into several core workloads, all accessing a single copy of data:
Data Warehouse: The traditional core business, replacing legacy on-premise systems (Teradata, Netezza) and first-generation cloud warehouses. It supports standard SQL reporting and analytics.
Data Lake: Allows storage of unstructured and semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet) at a low cost, competing directly with "Do-It-Yourself" Hadoop or S3-based lakes.
Data Engineering: Tools for data pipelines (ETL/ELT) to transform raw data into actionable insights.
Data Science & AI: Through Snowpark, developers can use non-SQL languages (Python, Java, Scala) to build ML models directly inside Snowflake. Cortex adds managed AI services.
Applications: The "Native Apps" framework allows developers to build and monetize applications that run directly within a customer's Snowflake account.
Data Sharing & Marketplace: A unique capability allowing organizations to share live data sets across the Snowflake ecosystem without copying or moving files (eliminating FTP/API fatigue).
Revenue Model: Consumption Utility
Snowflake operates on a consumption-based pricing model, distinct from the subscription-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model. Customers purchase "credits" which are consumed as they use compute resources (Virtual Warehouses) and storage.
Pre-purchased Capacity: Most enterprise customers sign annual or multi-year contracts for a set amount of credits (bookings). Revenue is recognized only when consumption occurs.
On-Demand: Smaller customers may pay in arrears based on actual usage.
This model aligns Snowflake’s revenue directly with customer value—if a customer stops running queries, revenue stops immediately. This creates volatility during downturns (as seen in FY24) but offers uncapped upside during expansion periods.
Geographic and Cloud Footprint
Snowflake is "cloud agnostic," running on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This multi-cloud availability is a critical competitive differentiator against the hyperscalers' own tools (e.g., AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse), as it prevents vendor lock-in at the infrastructure level.
Americas: Remains the dominant revenue driver, accounting for the majority of the $996.8 million product revenue in Q1 FY26.
EMEA and APJ: High-growth regions where Snowflake is aggressively hiring sales capacity and expanding data center regions to meet data sovereignty requirements.
5. Business Strategy & Outlook
Strategic Pivot: From Data Warehouse to AI Data Cloud
Under the leadership of Sridhar Ramaswamy (previously SVP of AI and co-founder of Neeva), Snowflake is executing a high-stakes pivot to position itself as the operating system for Enterprise AI. The central thesis is that "there is no AI strategy without a data strategy". Models are commodities; proprietary data is the differentiator.
Cortex & Snowpark: The strategy involves moving compute to the data. By embedding LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral, and proprietary Arctic models) directly into the platform via Cortex, Snowflake allows users to run inference and fine-tuning jobs on secure data without it ever leaving the governance perimeter.2 This addresses the primary barrier to enterprise AI adoption: data privacy and leakage risks.
Unistore: Bridging the gap between transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) workloads. Historically, these required separate databases. Unistore allows apps to write data that is immediately analyzable, expanding Snowflake’s TAM into operational applications.
Embracing Open Standards: The Iceberg Defensive
The rise of "open table formats" like Apache Iceberg threatened Snowflake's proprietary storage moat. Competitors like Databricks championed these formats, arguing that customers should own their data in open standards rather than locking it into a vendor's format.
The Pivot: In a significant strategic shift, Snowflake now treats Iceberg tables as first-class citizens. Customers can store data in their own buckets in Iceberg format and use Snowflake purely as the query engine.
Outlook: While this pressures storage revenue (a lower-margin stream), it significantly increases the "surface area" of data Snowflake can process. It removes the friction of "ingestion" (loading data), theoretically leading to higher compute volumes. We view this as a necessary evolution to prevent churn to open-source query engines.
Medium-Term Outlook (FY2026-FY2028)
We forecast a medium-term compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue of approximately 22-24%.
Tailwinds: The stabilization of cloud optimization, the maturation of the AI product suite (Cortex/Snowpark), and international expansion.
Headwinds: Intense pricing pressure from hyperscalers and Databricks.
Margins: Management is guiding toward free cash flow (FCF) margin expansion to 25% and beyond. The operational focus has shifted from "growth at all costs" to "efficient scale," with disciplined hiring and scrutiny on stock-based compensation (SBC). The transition to high-margin AI inference workloads will be a key variable; while revenue-accretive, the GPU compute costs are higher than CPU costs, potentially pressuring gross margins initially before optimization kicks in.
6. Bulls Say / Bears Say
Bulls Say
Data Gravity and Network Effects: Snowflake has aggregated more meaningful enterprise data than any other platform. The Snowflake Marketplace creates a powerful network effect: as more data providers (e.g., FactSet, Experian) join, the platform becomes stickier for data consumers. This "many-to-many" sharing capability is structurally difficult for single-tenant architectures to replicate.
The "Easy Button" for Enterprise AI: The sheer complexity of stitching together open-source AI tools (LangChain, vector databases, inference servers) is overwhelming for most IT departments. Snowflake’s fully managed Cortex service simplifies this into SQL functions. Bulls argue this will drive a massive wave of consumption from "citizen data scientists" and business analysts who can now leverage AI without deep engineering skills.
Financial Resilience: Snowflake possesses a fortress balance sheet with nearly $5 billion in liquidity and no net debt. This allows them to invest counter-cyclically (R&D, M&A) while competitors retrench. The ability to generate 29% FCF margins (FY25 actual) while growing at scale is a rare combination in software.
Bears Say
Commoditization of the Query Engine: The shift to open formats (Iceberg) decouples storage from compute. Bears argue that once data is in an open format, switching query engines becomes trivial. Customers could store data in Iceberg and use cheaper, "good enough" engines (like AWS Athena or open-source Trino) for basic workloads, relegating Snowflake to only the most complex, niche tasks.
The Databricks Threat: Databricks is growing rapidly and attacking Snowflake from the "left" (Data Science/Engineering). With its "Data Intelligence Platform" and acquisition of MosaicML, Databricks has a perceived lead in high-end AI and machine learning workloads. If Databricks’ SQL warehouse product reaches parity with Snowflake’s ease of use, Snowflake could lose its core constituency.4
Valuation Compression: Despite the pullback, Snowflake trades at a high multiple of Sales (~13-14x NTM). In a higher-for-longer interest rate environment, maintaining this premium requires flawless execution. Any deceleration in growth—or a failure of AI revenue to materialize meaningfully in FY26—could lead to further multiple compression.
7. Economic Moat
We assign Snowflake a Narrow Economic Moat, derived from High Switching Costs and Network Effects. While the company operates in a fiercely competitive landscape, its entrenchment in customer workflows and its unique data-sharing architecture provide durable competitive advantages.
Switching Costs (Primary Moat Source)
Switching a data warehouse is akin to performing a heart transplant for an enterprise.
Integration Depth: Snowflake sits at the center of the modern data stack. It connects to ingestion tools (Fivetran, Informatica), BI tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI), and operational apps (Salesforce). Rewiring these thousands of connections is technically perilous and costly.
Business Logic Lock-in: Over time, customers build complex logic, stored procedures, and secure views in Snowflake’s proprietary SQL dialect. Migrating this logic to another platform (e.g., Databricks or BigQuery) requires significant engineering hours and risks breaking critical reporting lines.
Governance as a Moat: Snowflake’s Horizon governance layer creates a unified security model (RBAC, masking policies) across clouds. Replicating this "single pane of glass" using disparate tools on a data lake is complex. IT heads are reluctant to leave a platform that guarantees data security and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).
Network Effects (Secondary Moat Source)
Snowflake is the only data platform with a true many-to-many data sharing architecture.
Mechanism: In traditional setups, sharing data means copying files (FTP) or building APIs. In Snowflake, "shares" are pointers to live data. A retailer can share point-of-sale data with a CPG supplier instantly.
The Marketplace: As of Q1 FY26, Snowflake had 606 customers with >$1M product revenue, many of whom are participating in this ecosystem. The value of the platform increases for every new user; a hedge fund joins Snowflake because the alternative data vendors are already there. This creates a flywheel that is distinct from the core storage/compute utility.
Why Not Wide Moat?
We refrain from a Wide Moat rating due to the rapid technological shifts in the sector. The rise of Open Table Formats (Iceberg) theoretically lowers switching costs by standardizing the storage layer. If the industry moves entirely to a model where the "compute engine" is a commoditized interchangeable part sitting on top of commodity storage, Snowflake’s pricing power could erode over the next 10-20 years. Furthermore, the hyperscalers (AWS, Azure) have infinite resources and bundle their competing products (Redshift, Synapse) with broader cloud contracts, creating a persistent ceiling on Snowflake’s pricing leverage.
8. Fair Value and Profit Drivers
We estimate a Fair Value of $210.00 per share for Snowflake. This valuation implies a forward Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales) multiple of approximately 14x and an Enterprise Value-to-Free Cash Flow (EV/FCF) multiple of roughly 55x based on our FY2026 estimates.
Revenue Growth Assumptions
Short-Term (FY26): We project product revenue of $4.45 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. This aligns with management's guidance of $1.035-$1.04 billion for Q2 and full-year expectations. We assume the consumption stabilization seen in Q1 continues, with NRR holding steady at ~122-124%.
Medium-Term (FY27-FY29): We model a gradual deceleration to roughly 20% growth by FY29. Growth will be driven by:
Workload Expansion: Migration of legacy on-premise warehouses (Teradata) which still hold nearly 50% of enterprise data.
AI Monetization: Cortex and Snowpark driving incremental compute intensity.
International: Growth in EMEA and APJ outpacing the Americas.
Margin Analysis
Gross Margin: We model non-GAAP product gross margins stabilizing at 75-76%. While software efficiencies provide a tailwind, the increasing mix of AI/GPU workloads (which have lower margins than CPU workloads due to hardware costs) will create a headwind. Management has signaled that they will pass through some infrastructure benefits to customers to drive adoption, capping gross margin expansion.
Operating Margin: We forecast significant operating leverage. Q1 FY26 non-GAAP operating margin was 9% (vs guidance of lower). We expect this to expand to roughly 20-22% by FY2029. The primary lever is Sales & Marketing (S&M) efficiency; as the brand matures and the partner ecosystem sells for Snowflake, Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) should decline relative to Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
Free Cash Flow (FCF): Snowflake’s billing model (upfront annual payments) creates a favorable working capital dynamic. We project FCF margins to expand from 25% in FY26 to 30% in the long term. This cash generation is a key support for the valuation.
WACC and DCF Inputs
WACC: We utilize a weighted average cost of capital of 8.8%. This incorporates a Beta of 1.09 , a risk-free rate of 4.2% (10-year Treasury) , and an equity risk premium of 4.5%.
Terminal Value: We apply a terminal growth rate of 3.5%, reflecting Snowflake’s position as critical utility infrastructure for the digital economy, growing faster than nominal GDP.
Valuation Bridge
Our DCF analysis yields an intrinsic value of ~$75 billion in market capitalization. With a share count of approximately 371 million (diluted) , this results in a per-share value of roughly $202-$210. The stock trading at ~$168 (pre-earnings stabilization level) implies the market is pricing in a sharper deceleration (to <15% growth) or structural margin compression from competition. We view these implied expectations as overly pessimistic given the Q1 beat.
9. Risk & Uncertainty
Uncertainty Rating: High
Snowflake operates in a high-velocity, high-stakes market where technological disruption is constant. Our "High" uncertainty rating reflects the following risks:
1. Consumption Model Volatility (Macro Risk)
Snowflake’s revenue is tied directly to active usage. In a macroeconomic downturn, enterprises can instantly "dial down" retention policies (e.g., storing data for 1 week instead of 1 month) or delay non-critical analytics projects. This lack of subscription-based revenue smoothing means Snowflake’s top line can decelerate faster than SaaS peers, as witnessed in FY24. While stabilized, any renewed recession fears would hit the stock hard.
2. The "Frenemy" Dynamic (Hyperscaler Risk)
Snowflake runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP. These companies are simultaneously its critical partners (infrastructure providers) and fiercest competitors (Redshift, Synapse, BigQuery).
Pricing Power: Hyperscalers could theoretically raise infrastructure costs for Snowflake or offer aggressive "bundling" discounts to customers who use their native warehouses, squeezing Snowflake’s margins or market share.
Data Egress: Cloud providers charge fees to move data out of their clouds. This "data gravity" benefits the incumbents and creates friction for Snowflake’s multi-cloud pitch.
3. Competitive Intensity (Databricks)
The rivalry with Databricks is the defining battle of the data decade. Databricks remains private but is capitalizing well (raising funds at high valuations) and aggressively targeting Snowflake’s core SQL users with "Databricks SQL." If Databricks succeeds in proving its "Lakehouse" architecture is faster and cheaper for BI, Snowflake’s growth story could be derailed. The nuance of "Open vs. Proprietary" formats is a key battleground where Databricks currently holds the marketing advantage.
4. Security and Trust
Snowflake holds the "crown jewels" of its customers—customer lists, financial data, health records. A significant security breach, even if it is a result of customer misconfiguration (like the 2024 credential stuffing attacks), could cause irreparable reputational damage. The "Trust" pillar is essential to the moat; if broken, the network effects unwind.
5. AI Disruption
Long-term, there is a risk that Generative AI changes the paradigm of data access. If future "AI Agents" can query raw files on S3 directly and answer business questions without needing a structured Data Warehouse, the entire category of "Cloud Data Warehouse" could face obsolescence. Snowflake is hedging this with Cortex, but the technological landscape is fluid.
10. Capital Allocation
Rating: Exemplary
We assess Snowflake’s capital allocation as Exemplary, driven by a prudent balance of reinvestment for growth, strategic M&A, and opportunistic shareholder returns.
Balance Sheet Strength
Snowflake maintains a fortress balance sheet. As of Q1 FY26 (April 30, 2025), the company held $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The company has convertible debt notes (due 2027 and 2029) but the net cash position is robust. This liquidity creates a massive strategic option value—allowing Snowflake to weather consumption downturns without cutting R&D or to acquire distressed assets in a tighter venture capital environment.
M&A Discipline
Snowflake has avoided the trap of massive, dilutive revenue-buying acquisitions. Instead, it pursues a "tuck-in" strategy focused on technology and talent.
Neeva (May 2023): Acquired for ~$150M. This was a critical strategic move, bringing Sridhar Ramaswamy (now CEO) and the core search/AI engineering team that built Cortex.
Streamlit (2022): Acquired for ~$800M. This cemented Snowflake’s relationship with the data science community, allowing Python developers to build apps on Snowflake.
Applica / Samooha: Smaller acquisitions focused on AI document understanding and clean rooms.
We view this discipline favorably. The company buys "capabilities," not "customers," which is harder to execute but creates more long-term value.
Shareholder Return Policy
Snowflake has matured from a pure-growth issuer to a shareholder-yield generator.
Buybacks: In Q1 FY26, the company repurchased 3.2 million shares for $491 million at an average price of $152.63. This was highly opportunistic, executing buybacks when the share price was depressed due to market pessimism.
Authorization: The board has authorized an additional $2.5 billion repurchase program extending through March 2027. This signals management’s view that the stock is undervalued and provides a floor for the share price.
Dividends: Snowflake does not pay a dividend, and we do not expect one in the foreseeable future as reinvestment remains the priority.

12. ESG Risk
Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating: 16.5 (Low Risk)
Snowflake exhibits a robust Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile, ranking in the top quartile of the software industry.
Environmental (Low Risk)
Snowflake is a cloud-native software provider and owns no physical manufacturing or data center assets. Its environmental footprint is Scope 2 and 3 (energy usage of cloud providers).
Efficiency: The multi-cluster shared data architecture is inherently efficient. It eliminates data silos (duplicate copies of data), reducing the storage footprint compared to on-premise systems.
Cloud Leverage: Snowflake runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP, all of whom have aggressive commitments to 100% renewable energy usage. By migrating customers from inefficient on-premise data centers to the cloud, Snowflake indirectly drives global carbon reduction.
Social (Medium Risk)
The primary social risk is Human Capital—the ability to recruit and retain high-end engineering talent in a competitive market.
Talent: Snowflake competes with Google, Meta, and Databricks for AI talent. The Neeva acquisition was a positive signal of its ability to attract top-tier AI researchers.
DEI: The company publishes annual diversity reports and has established Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to foster inclusion.
Data Privacy: As a data processor, Snowflake faces risks related to data breaches. The "Trust Center" product allows customers to monitor security posture, mitigating this risk.
Governance (Low Risk)
Structure: Snowflake separates the roles of CEO (Ramaswamy) and Chairman (Slootman), which is a best practice for oversight.
Board Composition: The board includes independent directors with significant software and finance experience.
Share Structure: Like many tech companies, Snowflake utilizes a dual-class share structure, which concentrates voting power. However, this is standard for the sector and investor concerns are mitigated by the company's strong execution and transparency.
Peer Comparison
Snowflake’s score of 16.5 compares favorably to:
Oracle: High Risk (due to governance and legacy controversies).
Palantir: Medium/High Risk (due to social/privacy concerns).
MongoDB: Medium Risk.

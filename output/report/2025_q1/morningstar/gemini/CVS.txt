Analyst Note

We maintain our Fair Value Estimate of $86.00 per share , following CVS Health’s fourth-quarter 2024 results. The stock has been the S&P 500’s top performer in the first quarter of 2025, rallying 50% , , , . This significant share price appreciation signals a sharp reversal in market sentiment, reflecting investor confidence in the new management team’s ability to execute a "meaningful recovery" in the core Aetna Medicare Advantage (MA) business, which severely underperformed in 2024 .
Despite this optimism, a significant disconnect exists between the market's bullish sentiment and the company's underlying fundamentals. Management’s initial full-year 2025 guidance is weak, projecting adjusted EPS of $5.75 to $6.00 , , and operating cash flow of only $6.5 billion , , . Analyst expectations for free cash flow in 2025 are as low as $4.0 billion , a trough level required to service debt and the dividend.
Furthermore, the company's fundamental competitive advantages have eroded, prompting a downgrade of its Economic Moat rating to "None" in Spring 2025 , , , . This downgrade reflects expectations of weak economic profits as the company faces severe, simultaneous regulatory pressure on its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) , and MA business models , .
While the stock appears undervalued relative to our $86.00 FVE, we reiterate our "High" Uncertainty rating , , . The recovery path requires flawless execution on three complex fronts: restoring Aetna’s margins, integrating the $10.6 billion Oak Street Health acquisition , and navigating existential regulatory reform in the PBM segment . We see significant execution risk ahead and believe the current rally overestimates the speed and certainty of a recovery.

Business Description

CVS Health is a diversified healthcare solutions company operating one of the largest vertically integrated models in the United States. The company's operations are managed through three primary segments:
Health Care Benefits (HCB): This segment provides health insurance services through Aetna . It serves an estimated 36 million people through a range of products, including Commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans .
Health Services (HCS): This segment includes the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) CVS Caremark, which serves approximately 88 million plan members . This segment also houses the company's new provider assets, acquired in 2023: Signify Health (in-home evaluations and care) , and Oak Street Health (a value-based primary care network for seniors) , .
Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness (PCW): This segment operates a retail footprint of over 9,000 pharmacy locations and more than 1,000 walk-in MinuteClinic medical clinics . It also provides long-term care pharmacy services and pharmacy fulfillment , .

Business Strategy & Outlook

CVS Health's long-term strategy is to redefine healthcare delivery by tightly integrating its insurance (Aetna), pharmacy benefits (Caremark), and care delivery (Oak Street, Signify, and MinuteClinic) assets , . The strategic goal is to build a vertically integrated system that can compete with UnitedHealth/Optum by managing the total cost of care for its members . The $10.6 billion acquisition of Oak Street Health and the $8 billion acquisition of Signify Health are the cornerstones of this strategy, designed to control patient care from the primary care clinic to the home and pharmacy, theoretically lowering medical costs and improving outcomes for Aetna’s MA members .
However, the company is executing this complex, capital-intensive strategy at a moment of extreme vulnerability in its core profit engines. Management admitted on the Q4 2024 earnings call that growth in the Health Services segment is being "diluted by headwinds in our healthcare delivery business" , implying the newly acquired assets are not yet profitable or are underperforming initial expectations.
The 2025 outlook is defined by these conflicting priorities. Management has guided for a "meaningful recovery" at Aetna but has designated 2025 as a "transition year" for its PBM and pharmacy segments , . The company is defensively rolling out its new CVS CostVantage model, which bases reimbursement on the actual drug cost plus a defined markup and dispensing fee . This model is a direct reaction to intense regulatory pressure for price transparency , , . This transition is expected to contribute to an approximate 5% decline in adjusted operating income for the PCW segment in 2025 . Success in the medium term depends on stabilizing Aetna margins while absorbing the financial drag from the new provider businesses and resetting the entire PBM business model under regulatory fire.

Bulls Say / Bears Say

Bulls Say: The 2024 "kitchen sink" year for Aetna is over. New management has reset expectations and is now focused on restoring margins through disciplined pricing and benefit redesigns, guiding for a "meaningful recovery" in 2025 .
Bulls Say: The vertically integrated model (Aetna + Caremark + Oak Street) creates a unique, long-term opportunity to manage patient health holistically. This should produce durable cost synergies and competitive advantages that the market is not fully appreciating , .
Bulls Say: CVS Caremark continues to prove its value proposition in controlling drug costs. In 2024, it successfully converted over 90% of eligible Humira patients to biosimilars, saving clients nearly $1 billion and demonstrating its market leadership .
Bulls Say: The 50% stock rally in Q1 2025 , , —making it the S&P 500's top performer —indicates the market has confidence in the new CEO's turnaround plan and that the stock was deeply oversold at its 2024 lows.
Bears Say: The "None" economic moat rating is justified , , . The company's return on invested capital (ROIC) of 4.15% has fallen below its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.76% , indicating it is currently destroying shareholder value as it grows.
Bears Say: Regulatory risk is existential and accelerating. At least 31 states enacted new PBM laws in 2025 alone . Federal bills, including the PBM Reform Act of 2025, "directly threaten... Caremark's business structure" by aiming to ban spread pricing and delink compensation from drug prices .
Bears Say: The Medicare Advantage business is a permanent headwind, not a temporary problem. The finalized 2025 MA rate increase of 3.7% is below medical cost trends , and the looming threat of RADV audits creates a massive, unquantifiable liability .
Bears Say: The 2025 guidance is weak (Adj. EPS $5.75-$6.00) , , and cash flow is at a trough. Management confirmed they are "not contemplating any share repurchases in 2025" because all available capital is required to service debt from its recent expensive acquisitions.

Economic Moat

We assign CVS Health a "None" Economic Moat rating , , . This represents a downgrade from its prior "Narrow" moat status in Spring 2025 , , , . This downgrade is not based on a single event but rather a fundamental erosion of the company's two primary historical moat sources—scale-based cost advantages and switching costs—which have been nullified by poor execution and intense regulatory headwinds.
The first source of the prior moat was Aetna's scale, which should have allowed it to manage medical costs and price plans competitively. This advantage failed demonstrably in 2024, as the segment "underperformed" , mispriced plans, and underestimated medical costs, leading to a collapse in profitability. This failure proves the advantage was either illusory or poorly managed.
The second moat source was CVS Caremark's massive scale and high switching costs for large PBM clients. This profit pool was built on an opaque pricing model (rebates, spread pricing). This model is now under direct and coordinated attack from state and federal regulators , , . The company's defensive pivot to the new, transparent "CVS CostVantage" model is a tacit admission that its old, high-margin business model is no longer viable.
The combination of these pressures has led to "weak economic profits expected for the foreseeable future" , . Financial evidence supports this conclusion, with analyst estimates showing the company's ROIC (4.15%) has fallen below its WACC (4.76%) , the technical definition of value destruction.

Fair Value and Profit Drivers

Our $86.00 Fair Value Estimate is based on a multi-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model , .
Our valuation is driven by the following key profit drivers and assumptions:
Revenue: We model 4.5% revenue growth in 2025, consistent with analyst consensus projecting $387.4 billion over 2024's $372.8 billion . We forecast a 5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 4.0% to 4.5%, driven by health services and insurance premiums, offset by slower retail growth.
Margins: 2025 represents a margin trough. Our model incorporates management's guidance for an approximate 5% decline in PCW segment adjusted operating income and assumes Health Services segment growth will be "diluted by headwinds in our healthcare delivery business" . The model assumes a "meaningful recovery" in HCB (Aetna) margins beginning in the second half of 2025 and accelerating in 2026 as repricing actions take hold.
Earnings Per Share (EPS): The model is anchored by management's 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance of $5.75 to $6.00 , , . This represents a severe reduction from 2023's $8.74 but a modest recovery from 2024's $5.42 , . We forecast a recovery to normalized EPS levels post-2026.
Cash Flow: 2025 is a trough year for cash flow. Management guided to approximately $6.5 billion in operating cash flow , , . We project free cash flow (FCF) as low as $4.0 billion for the year , reflecting this pressure. Our model assumes FCF recovers toward a normalized $10 billion-plus level in the outer years of the forecast .
Valuation Assumptions: Our DCF analysis uses a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 6.77% , , derived from a 7.81% cost of equity and a 5.11% pre-tax cost of debt .
Our $86.00 FVE implies a 2025 price/earnings ratio of 14.8x on our $5.82 midpoint EPS estimate. We view this multiple as reasonable given the significant "High" uncertainty and substantial execution risk embedded in the 2025 turnaround story.

Risk & Uncertainty

We assign CVS Health a "High" Uncertainty rating , , . The rating is driven by the confluence of three major, concurrent risks: regulatory, execution, and macro. The company’s 2024 10-K, filed in February 2025, details these risks .
Key risk factors include:
PBM Regulatory Risk: This is the most significant and severe risk. The PBM business model is under a coordinated attack. At the state level, at least 31 states enacted approximately 70 new drug cost laws in 2025 alone . At the federal level, multiple bills, including the PBM Reform Act of 2025 and the Patients Before Middlemen Act, are in discussion , , . These proposals aim to "delink" PBM compensation from drug prices and ban spread pricing , which "directly threaten[s] CVS Caremark's business structure" .
Medicare Advantage (MA) Risk: The HCB segment's profitability is highly sensitive to CMS policy. The finalized 2025 MA payment rate increase of 3.7% is viewed by the industry as insufficient to cover underlying medical cost trends . Furthermore, the CMS Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit rule, which allows for the extrapolation of overpayments from small samples, could have "material adverse effects on... operating results" , creating a significant and unquantified contingent liability.
Execution & Integration Risk: The 2025 recovery is entirely contingent on a successful margin turnaround at Aetna . This recovery relies on benefit redesigns that could drive significant membership losses, potentially as high as 10% . Simultaneously, the HCS segment is being "diluted by headwinds in our healthcare delivery business" as it attempts to integrate the large, costly Oak Street and Signify acquisitions.
Macro Risk: The business remains exposed to "volatility in health care costs and utilization" . A continuation of the elevated medical cost trends that plagued 2024 would invalidate the 2025 guidance and delay the recovery thesis.

Capital Allocation

Capital allocation in 2025 is defined by constraint and deleveraging. Following the major acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health in 2023, management's stated priority is strengthening the balance sheet , .
Balance Sheet: Management is focused on deleveraging from its current leverage ratio toward its long-term target , .
M&A: The company is in an integration and digestion phase. No significant M&A is anticipated in 2025 as focus shifts to extracting value from the Oak Street Health , and Signify Health , platforms.
Dividends: The dividend remains a stated priority. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share on March 20, 2025, consistent with the previous quarter , , . This represents an annualized rate of $2.66 per share. Based on 1.261 billion shares outstanding , this implies a total annual cash outlay of approximately $3.36 billion. This dividend appears covered by the 2025 operating cash flow guidance of $6.5 billion , , , but coverage is thin relative to analyst FCF estimates as low as $4.0 billion .
Share Repurchases: Management explicitly stated on the Q4 2024 earnings call that they are "not contemplating any share repurchases in 2025" . This is a prudent decision necessary to prioritize deleveraging during a cash flow trough year .
We have not assigned a formal Capital Allocation rating. The suspension of buybacks to prioritize the balance sheet is appropriate. However, the "None" moat rating and ROIC running below WACC call into question the long-term value creation potential of the M&A that this capital is now being allocated to service.

3. Analyst Note

This research note follows The Cigna Group's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings release on January 30, 2025. The company reported strong top-line results and underlying growth, though profitability was marked by a significant disparity between its two main segments. Full-year 2024 adjusted EPS was $27.33, an increase from $25.09 in 2023 . Total revenues for 2024 surged 27% to $247.1 billion.
The investment thesis for Cigna is centered on a strategic transformation. The company is in the final stages of divesting its capital-intensive and sub-scale Medicare businesses , a move that sharpens its focus on its two core platforms: the high-growth Evernorth Health Services segment and the streamlined Cigna Healthcare commercial insurance business.
Full-year 2024 results highlighted the divergent paths of these two segments. Evernorth was the primary growth engine, with its full-year 2024 adjusted revenues increasing 32%, driven by large client wins and robust specialty pharmacy volumes. Conversely, Cigna Healthcare faced significant margin pressure; its Medical Care Ratio (MCR) increased to 83.2% for the full year (from 81.3% in 2023) and spiked to 87.9% in the fourth quarter . This deterioration was attributed to "higher stop loss medical costs".
Management's initial 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of "at least $29.50" signals confidence that these MCR issues are contained and that "corrective actions" are being implemented. This guidance appears achievable, supported by the ongoing momentum in Evernorth and, critically, by a massive and fully funded capital return program. Cigna repurchased $7.0 billion of its stock in 2024 and increased its total share repurchase authorization to $10.3 billion. The proceeds from the pending $3.3 billion HCSC divestiture are also earmarked for further buybacks . This buyback program provides a substantial, non-operational floor for EPS growth.
At its January 30, 2025 closing price of $282.98 , Cigna trades at approximately 9.6 times 2025 consensus EPS . This multiple suggests the market is overly discounting the temporary MCR headwinds and ignoring the value being unlocked by the strategic transformation and aggressive capital returns. Our $340 Fair Value Estimate, implying an 11.5x forward P/E, reflects a significant valuation gap.

4. Business Description

The Cigna Group is a global health company that operates through two primary growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare.
Evernorth Health Services provides a comprehensive range of health services, primarily to other health plans, employers, and government bodies. Its portfolio, built largely from the 2018 acquisition of Express Scripts , includes:
Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM): Manages pharmacy benefits for 118.3 million customers as of December 31, 2024.
Specialty Pharmacy: Operates Accredo, a leading specialty pharmacy that distributes and manages high-cost therapies .
Care Services: Offers integrated care delivery solutions, including virtual care and behavioral health services .
Cigna Healthcare provides medical, dental, behavioral, and other insurance products and services . This segment primarily serves the U.S. Employer market, with a focus on self-funding arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, Cigna Healthcare had 19.1 million medical customers.
In January 2024, Cigna entered a definitive agreement to sell its Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicare Supplemental Benefits, and CareAllies businesses to HCSC for approximately $3.3 billion . This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 .

5. Business Strategy & Outlook

The Cigna Group's core strategy is one of simplification and focused execution. The divestiture of its government-focused businesses is the central plank of this strategy, streamlining the portfolio and removing a non-core asset that required "disproportionate" resources and investment to achieve scale . This allows management to redeploy capital and focus on its two most synergistic platforms.
Evernorth serves as the company's primary growth engine. The strategy is to leverage its integrated service model to capture growth from the most complex and costly areas of healthcare. Key initiatives include:
Managing High-Cost Drug Spend: Evernorth has launched innovative solutions to help clients manage soaring costs for new drug classes. This includes EncircleRx, a program designed to manage GLP-1 (obesity) drug spend, which comes with an industry-first financial guarantee .
Driving Biosimilar Adoption: The company is aggressively using its specialty pharmacy (Accredo) and PBM platforms to promote biosimilar adoption, which lowers costs for clients and patients. A key example is making a Humira biosimilar available at a $0 out-of-pocket cost for Accredo patients .
Expanding Clinical Services: Cigna is expanding its new Evernorth Behavioral Care Group, a mental health practice designed to provide timely access to care, addressing a high-demand, high-cost area for employers .
Cigna Healthcare is being optimized as the cash-flow engine of the enterprise. The strategy is to enhance its focus on the U.S. Employer business by delivering a competitive total cost of care . This includes addressing the recent MCR volatility by taking "corrective actions" to re-price or manage the stop loss business that drove high costs in 2024.
Management has provided a long-term average annual adjusted EPS growth target of 10%-14% . The aggressive capital return program, funded by strong cash flow and the pending divestiture, provides a significant non-operational tailwind to this EPS target. This financial engineering makes the 10%-14% goal highly achievable, even if operational growth (like MCR stabilization) proves modest, as the share count can be significantly reduced at attractive multiples.
For the full year 2025, management has issued guidance for "at least $29.50" in adjusted EPS and "at least $7.9 billion" in adjusted income from operations. This guidance includes segment-level operating income targets of "at least $7.2 billion" for Evernorth Health Services and "at least $4.1 billion" for Cigna Healthcare .

6. Bulls Say / Bears Say

Bulls Say
The pending HCSC divestiture is a clear "addition by subtraction." It streamlines a complex portfolio, sheds a sub-scale, capital-intensive asset that required "disproportionate" resources , and allows management to focus on its core, high-margin businesses.
Evernorth is a "best-in-class" health services asset. It is positioned in the fastest-growing areas of healthcare, particularly specialty pharmacy . Its 32% adjusted revenue growth in 2024 demonstrates its ability to win large, sophisticated clients and grow its 118.3 million-customer PBM base.
The capital allocation program is a powerful and fully funded catalyst. The $10.3 billion share repurchase authorization , supported by strong free cash flow ($8.96 billion in 2024) and the incoming $3.3 billion in divestiture proceeds , provides a massive and visible source of EPS accretion.
Management's 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of "at least $29.50" is resilient. It was issued after the Q4 MCR spike, signaling management's confidence in their "corrective actions" and the durability of Evernorth's earnings stream.
Bears Say
The Cigna Healthcare segment is operationally impaired. The Q4 2024 MCR of 87.9% is a significant red flag, indicating a potential loss of underwriting discipline or a structural shift in stop loss medical costs. If these trends are not "corrective," the 2025 Cigna Healthcare profit target of $4.1 billion is unattainable.
Evernorth's PBM business model faces existential regulatory risk. The entire PBM industry is under intense, bipartisan political scrutiny . Potential legislation mandating rebate pass-throughs or other reforms could severely compress Evernorth's margins, undermining the entire long-term growth thesis .
The capital allocation track record is flawed. Management's 2024 results included a $2.7 billion non-cash after-tax investment loss related to the impairment of VillageMD equity securities , demonstrating poor recent judgment in M&A and capital deployment.
Growth is decelerating after a strong 2024. The 27% revenue growth in 2024 was driven by large client wins and is not repeatable. Consensus forecasts show revenue growth slowing to 11.5% in 2025 and 4.9% in 2026 , suggesting Cigna is maturing into a slower-growth entity.

7. Economic Moat

A Narrow Economic Moat rating is assigned to The Cigna Group. This rating is derived from the combined competitive advantages of its two primary segments, with the majority of the moat's strength and durability residing in the Evernorth Health Services platform.
The primary moat source is Evernorth, which benefits from cost advantages and high client switching costs.
Cost Advantage: As one of the three largest PBMs in the United States, Evernorth leverages its immense scale (118.3 million pharmacy customers) to negotiate significant price concessions and rebates from drug manufacturers. This scale creates a powerful cost advantage that smaller, sub-scale PBMs cannot replicate, forming a high barrier to entry.
Switching Costs: PBM contracts are typically multi-year and become deeply integrated into a client's (employer or health plan) benefits administration and IT infrastructure. Changing a PBM is a complex, costly, and highly disruptive process that carries the risk of significant member and employee abrasion. This creates high switching costs, which in turn leads to high client retention rates and a stable, recurring revenue base.
The secondary moat source is Cigna Healthcare, which benefits from network effects.
Network Effects: With 19.1 million medical members , the Cigna Healthcare segment benefits from a virtuous cycle. A large member base allows Cigna to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates with providers (hospitals, physicians) . A more extensive and cost-effective provider network makes Cigna's insurance products more attractive to employers, allowing it to attract and retain more members.
The 2018 combination of Cigna and Express Scripts (now Evernorth) provides synergistic reinforcement, allowing the company to offer clients a holistic view of medical and pharmacy spend, which is a critical tool for managing total healthcare costs . This integrated "med-pharm" offering enhances the switching costs for clients who utilize both services.
The company's strategy is also actively evolving the nature of this moat. The traditional PBM moat (rebate negotiation) is a significant regulatory liability . Cigna's strategy is migrating its value proposition away from simple rebate negotiation and toward managing complex cost trends. By launching platforms for GLP-1s, biosimilars, and other specialty drugs , Evernorth is shifting its role to that of a "complex-cost-trend manager." This role is more valuable, harder to replicate, and strengthens the switching-cost component of the moat, making it more durable against regulatory change.

8. Fair Value and Profit Drivers

A Fair Value Estimate of $340.00 is assigned to The Cigna Group. This valuation is derived from a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, supported by a P/E multiple analysis. The DCF model assumes a 5-year revenue CAGR of 4.7% , a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.8%, and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.
The key profit drivers for 2025 are based on bridging the 2024 adjusted EPS of $27.33 to the consensus 2025E adj. EPS of $29.62 :
Evernorth Segment Growth: This is the primary operational driver. We project Evernorth will meet or exceed its $7.2 billion operating income guidance , driven by continued robust demand for specialty pharmacy services and the full-year benefit of new PBM clients.
Cigna Healthcare Margin Stabilization: This driver assumes management's "corrective actions" in the stop loss business are successful. This would lead to a normalization of the MCR from Q4 2024's 87.9% level and allow the segment to achieve its $4.1 billion operating income guidance .
Aggressive Share Repurchases: This is the most significant non-operational driver and provides a floor for EPS growth. The $10.3 billion authorization and the redeployment of HCSC sale proceeds will substantially reduce the average-shares-outstanding, providing a highly confident source of EPS accretion that is independent of medical cost trends.
At the January 30, 2025 closing price of $282.98 , Cigna trades at 9.55x 2025E consensus adjusted EPS of $29.62 . Our $340 FVE implies a forward P/E of 11.48x 2025E adj. EPS. This modest multiple is appropriate and conservative, justified by the company's 10-14% long-term adjusted EPS growth target and the high-quality, high-growth services revenue from the Evernorth segment.
The market's 9.55x multiple reflects a fixation on the MCR volatility and PBM regulatory risk . This valuation fails to appropriately credit the value being unlocked by the company's transformation. The HCSC divestiture provides $3.3 billion in cash that management has stated will be used for buybacks at this depressed multiple. The investment thesis is that the market is pricing in operational risks as certainties, while ignoring the highly certain, value-accretive financial engineering of the buyback program.

9. Risk & Uncertainty

The High Uncertainty rating is driven by the binary nature of regulatory threats to the core PBM business and the significant operational volatility recently demonstrated in the insurance segment. These factors create a wide range of potential outcomes.
Key risks include:
Regulatory Risk (PBMs): This is the most significant risk. Evernorth's PBM operations are subject to intense and bipartisan political scrutiny . Potential legislation aimed at PBM rebate models, drug-pricing transparency, or "spread pricing" could fundamentally and negatively alter the segment's profitability .
Medical Cost Trend (MCR) Risk: The sharp increase in the Cigna Healthcare MCR to 87.9% in Q4 2024 highlights the risk of elevated medical utilization or poor underwriting in the stop loss book. If management's "corrective actions" are ineffective, or if cost trends accelerate, the 2025 earnings guidance will be at risk.
Execution Risk: The company is managing three major initiatives simultaneously: 1) The complex divestiture and separation of its Medicare businesses to HCSC ; 2) The integration and onboarding of large new PBM clients ; and 3) The operational turnaround of its Cigna Healthcare segment. A failure in any of these execution-heavy workstreams could lead to margin erosion or client losses.
ESG & Reputational Risk: As a PBM and insurer, Cigna is exposed to material ESG risks. These include data privacy and cybersecurity for its 182.2 million customers and business ethics related to drug affordability and access to care .

10. Capital Allocation

An Exemplary rating is assigned for Capital Allocation, based on a clear, disciplined, and highly shareholder-friendly capital deployment strategy.
Disciplined M&A and Divestiture: The decision to sell the Medicare and CareAllies businesses to HCSC is a prime example of strong M&A discipline. Management identified these as sub-scale assets that required "disproportionate" capital and management focus and successfully monetized them. This strategic divestiture demonstrates a focus on core competencies. Furthermore, the company confirmed in late 2024 that it was not pursuing a large-scale combination with Humana, opting instead to focus on its aggressive share repurchase strategy .
Aggressive and Clear Shareholder Returns: Cigna's primary capital deployment priority is share repurchases.
2024 Activity: The company repurchased 20.9 million shares for approximately $7.0 billion during 2024.
Current Authorization: The Board approved an additional $6.0 billion in buybacks, bringing the total share repurchase authority to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 .
Use of Proceeds: Management explicitly stated the "majority" of proceeds from the HCSC transaction will be allocated to share repurchases.
Strong and Growing Dividend: The company's robust cash flow supports a strong dividend. On January 30, 2025, the Board of Directors declared an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.40 to $1.51 per share .
This capital allocation framework is strategically coherent. Management is divesting non-core, capital-heavy assets and using the proceeds to repurchase its core, high-growth, high-moat business at what we view as a low 9.55x forward P/E multiple . This is a text-book value-enhancing strategy.

12. ESG Risk

The Cigna Group maintains strong external ESG ratings, including an "AA" rating from MSCI, which designates the company as a "Leader" in its industry . Sustainalytics rates the company as "Low Risk".
These ratings place Cigna in a leadership position on ESG metrics relative to its peers. The company was named #1 in the Health Care Providers industry by JUST Capital and ranked in the top 10 of all JUST 100 companies .
Based on Cigna's 2024 Corporate Impact Report and third-party analyses, the most material ESG issues for the company are :
Sustainable Health Care / Access to Basic Services: This is inherent to Cigna's core business and includes initiatives around health equity, product affordability, and improving access to medical and behavioral care .
Data Protection: Given the 182.2 million customer relationships , the protection of sensitive personal health information is a critical operational and reputational risk .
Business Ethics and Compliance: This is a key governance risk, focusing on responsible supply chain management, ethical business practices, and transparency .
It is important to note a contradiction between Cigna's high aggregate ESG score and its most significant financial risk. The "AA" and "Low Risk" ratings are driven by strong performance in environmental ("E") factors (e.g., sustainable operations) and social ("S") factors (e.g., employee health, D&I) . However, the single greatest financial risk to the firm—PBM regulation —is a direct function of the "Business Ethics" and governance ("G") factors related to its opaque PBM rebate model. The high-level ESG score masks this severe, concentrated risk embedded in the company's core business model.

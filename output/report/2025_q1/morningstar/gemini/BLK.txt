Analyst Note

We initiate coverage of BlackRock (BLK) with a Fair Value Estimate of $1,100.00. Our thesis is predicated on a fundamental strategic transformation, announced at the firm's March 2025 Investor Day , that is re-architecting the firm toward higher-growth, higher-margin private markets and technology services. We believe the market, which values BLK at approximately 19.8x our 2025 EPS estimate , has not yet fully appreciated the durability and accelerating nature of this new earnings profile.
While 2024 was a record year that solidified BlackRock's scale leadership—finishing with $11.6 trillion in AUM and attracting a record $641 billion in net inflows —these results are now being leveraged to execute a decisive pivot. The acquisitions of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) , HPS Investment Partners (pending) , and Preqin (pending) are transformative, not incremental. They form the foundation for management's new 2030 ambition: to achieve a 10% revenue CAGR and double operating income .
This strategy directly addresses the primary bear case of secular fee compression in the firm's legacy passive business . BlackRock’s wide economic moat is sourced from its dominant scale, but its durability comes from the high-switching-cost Aladdin technology platform . The integration of Preqin's private market data into Aladdin will create the industry's only "whole portfolio" operating system , effectively locking in institutional clients who are structurally increasing private asset allocations. Our $1,100 FVE reflects an anticipated re-rating as this higher-quality, tech- and private-market-driven revenue mix becomes the firm's primary growth engine.

Business Description

BlackRock, Inc. is the world's largest investment management firm, concluding 2024 with $11.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM) . The company provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients in over 100 countries . It operates a highly diversified platform that enables it to tailor solutions across asset classes.
Key business platforms include:
Index and ETFs: A dominant global provider of passive investment products, most notably through its iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) .
Active Management: Includes alpha-seeking strategies across fundamental and systematic equities, fixed income, multi-asset, and cash management .
Private Markets: A critical high-growth area for the firm, rapidly expanding via major acquisitions to build leading franchises in infrastructure (Global Infrastructure Partners) and private credit (HPS Investment Partners, pending) .
Technology Services: Centered on the Aladdin (Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network) platform, a comprehensive investment and risk management operating system licensed to both internal teams and external institutional clients . This segment also includes eFront, a platform for managing alternative investments, and Cachematrix, a cash management platform .
The firm is globally diversified, with approximately 21,100 employees in more than 30 countries and approximately 35% of its total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States .

Business Strategy & Outlook

BlackRock is executing a significant strategic pivot to accelerate growth in private markets and technology. This strategy is explicitly designed to capture durable, high-growth secular trends—namely the institutional shift to alternatives and the demand for data-driven "whole portfolio" solutions—while simultaneously offsetting margin pressure from secular fee compression in its passive product suite . This new strategy was formally articulated at the company's 2025 Investor Day .
The firm's outlook is anchored by a new "2030 Ambition" . Management has set a long-term target to double its as-adjusted operating income to approximately $15 billion by 2030, from a 2024 base of $8 billion . This goal is underpinned by a target for a 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue . Critically, this plan involves a fundamental shift in the firm's revenue mix: by 2030, BlackRock aims to generate over 30% of its total revenue from the combined Private Markets & Technology segments, a significant increase that will durably lift the firm's overall fee rate and margin profile .
This strategic ambition is being executed via a "kit" of transformative acquisitions announced in 2024:
Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP): This acquisition, which closed on October 1, 2024 , provides BlackRock with a market-leading infrastructure product platform .
HPS Investment Partners: This acquisition, expected to close in mid-2025 , provides a world-class private credit product platform, accelerating BlackRock's capabilities in another key alternative asset class .
Preqin: This acquisition, expected to close in Q1 2025 , provides the critical data infrastructure for the private markets industry .
The combination of these assets is designed to create an integrated "1BLK Platform" . By integrating Preqin's industry-standard data into the Aladdin and eFront technology platforms, BlackRock is building the first and only technology operating system capable of managing a client's "whole portfolio," from public equities and bonds to illiquid private equity, credit, and infrastructure assets . Management enters 2025 from a position of strength, having generated 7% annualized organic base fee growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 , and expects this new, integrated platform to drive more resilient organic growth and greater resilience through market cycles .

Bulls Say / Bears Say

Bulls Say: The strategic pivot, executed through the GIP, HPS, and Preqin acquisitions , creates a powerful new high-growth, high-fee revenue engine. This engine is not correlated to public market beta, diversifies the firm's earnings, and justifies a higher valuation multiple.
Bulls Say: The integration of Preqin's data into the Aladdin platform creates an unassailable "whole portfolio" ecosystem. This deepens BlackRock's wide economic moat by making its technology indispensable, creating powerful cross-selling opportunities for its new private market products.
Bulls Say: The firm's unparalleled scale ($11.6T AUM) and flow momentum (record $641B net inflows in 2024) allow it to generate significant operating leverage, as evidenced by the 280 basis points of as-adjusted margin expansion in 2024 , while funding aggressive capital returns.
Bulls Say: Management's new 10% revenue CAGR target and 2030 ambition to double operating income signal a new era of growth that current consensus estimates fail to capture.
Bears Say: The primary risk remains persistent and accelerating fee compression in the core iShares ETF and passive businesses , which still represent the vast majority of AUM and could offset margin gains from the high-fee alternatives business.
Bears Say: The firm's earnings remain highly sensitive to market volatility. A sustained bear market in equities and fixed income, potentially driven by stagflationary macro risks or trade policy uncertainty , would cause AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline .
Bears Say: Management is undertaking significant integration risk by attempting to absorb three massive, complex, and culturally distinct organizations (GIP, HPS, Preqin) simultaneously . A failure to integrate platforms or retain key talent could destroy value and lead to a failure to realize projected synergies.
Bears Say: BlackRock's sheer size makes it a primary target for global regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, it faces escalating political and reputational risk from ESG-related backlash, which has already prompted client withdrawals .

Economic Moat

A Wide economic moat is assigned to BlackRock, based on mutually reinforcing advantages from intangible assets and exceptionally high client switching costs.
Intangible Assets: The first source is BlackRock's brand and scale. The firm's $11.6 trillion AUM makes it a "universal owner" and the default partner for large, complex institutional mandates. This scale creates a "1BLK Platform" where clients consolidate assets, knowing BlackRock possesses best-in-class capabilities across every asset class and geography . This brand power affords it unparalleled data insights, purchasing power in the market, and the ability to attract elite talent.
Switching Costs: This is the firm's most durable and deepening moat source, centered on the Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin is not merely software; it is the embedded "operating system" and "language of portfolios" for over 360,000 institutional users . It is deeply integrated into clients' entire investment workflows, from risk analytics and portfolio construction to trade execution and operational reporting. For a major insurer or pension fund, replacing Aladdin would be a prohibitively costly, complex, and high-risk endeavor, requiring a complete re-architecture of its investment process.
This already-wide moat is being actively deepened. The pending acquisition of Preqin is a critical strategic maneuver. Private markets are notoriously opaque and lack standardized data. By acquiring Preqin, the industry-standard data provider , and integrating that data directly into the Aladdin/eFront ecosystem , BlackRock is creating the only technology platform that can seamlessly manage risk and performance across a whole portfolio of both public and private assets. As institutions are structurally increasing their allocations to private markets, this "whole portfolio" OS transforms Aladdin from a best-in-class tool for public markets into an essential utility for the entire industry, making switching costs insurmountable.
Network Effects: The Aladdin platform also benefits from a powerful network effect. As more institutions utilize the platform, they feed more data into the system, which enhances its risk models and value for all other users .

Fair Value and Profit Drivers

The $1,100.00 Fair Value Estimate is based on a discounted cash flow model that reflects management's new, accelerated growth targets announced at the 2025 Investor Day . This FVE implies a 2025E P/E of 23.0x and a 2026E P/E of 20.5x, based on consensus EPS estimates . This premium valuation is justified by the firm's wide economic moat, superior growth profile, and the strategic pivot toward higher-margin, more durable revenue streams from private markets and technology.
Key profit drivers and model assumptions:
Revenue: A 5-year revenue CAGR of 10.0% (2025E-2029E) is modeled, in line with management's 2030 ambition . This growth is driven by an assumed 5%-7% organic base fee growth (consistent with the Q4 2024 exit rate of 7% ), augmented by the full-year, accretive impact of the GIP, HPS, and Preqin acquisitions . Revenue is forecast to reach $22.4 billion in 2025 and $24.7 billion in 2026.
Operating Margins: As-adjusted operating margins are forecast to expand from 44.5% in 2024 to approximately 46.0% by 2029. This gradual expansion is driven by the mix-shift toward higher-margin private market and technology revenues, as outlined in the 2030 strategic plan , combined with continued operating leverage from the firm's scale.
AUM Growth: The model assumes organic AUM growth continues at a 5%+ rate, augmented by the AUM from the GIP and HPS acquisitions.
The model utilizes a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 8.1% . This is derived from an 8.4% cost of equity (using Capital Asset Pricing Model methodology), a 6.4% pre-tax cost of debt, and a 21% corporate tax rate, resulting in a 5.1% after-tax cost of debt. The capital structure is weighted at 92% equity and 8% debt .
This model supports the consensus EPS trajectory:
FY 2024 (Actual, As-Adjusted): $43.61
FY 2025E (Consensus): $47.75
FY 2026E (Consensus): $53.76
FY 2027E (Consensus): $61.52

Risk & Uncertainty

BlackRock's valuation faces several key risks that could impede the base-case thesis.
Market Sensitivity (Beta Risk): The firm's primary risk exposure. A significant portion of revenue is derived from AUM-based investment advisory fees. Market volatility or a sustained downturn in global equity and fixed income markets would cause AUM to decline, directly reducing revenue and earnings . Furthermore, poor investment performance relative to benchmarks could lead to client withdrawals .
Macroeconomic Risk: As of March 2025, the macroeconomic outlook is characterized by uncertainty regarding tariffs and global trade tensions . A "stagflationary" outcome, which would pressure both equity and bond valuations simultaneously, presents a significant risk to AUM-based fees .
Fee Compression Risk: A persistent secular headwind, particularly in the firm's core passive and iShares ETF businesses . Intense competition continues to drive management fees lower, which could pressure consolidated margins even as the private markets business grows.
M&A Integration Risk: The firm is undertaking a highly complex operational challenge by simultaneously integrating three large-scale acquisitions (GIP, HPS, Preqin) . A failure to successfully merge technology platforms, align corporate cultures, retain key personnel, or achieve projected synergies presents a material risk to the growth thesis.
Regulatory and Reputational Risk: As the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock faces intense regulatory scrutiny globally. It is also exposed to significant reputational and political risk from "ESG backlash" and divergent stakeholder views on climate, which the firm identifies as a key risk in its 2024 10-K .
Operational Risk: The firm's 10-K filing highlights a concentration risk in the third-party financial institutions (e.g., clearing organizations, exchanges) it uses. A technical or operational failure at one of these counterparties could disrupt services for multiple BlackRock clients .

Capital Allocation

An Exemplary Capital Allocation rating is assigned. BlackRock's management has demonstrated a highly effective and confident "all of the above" strategy, balancing aggressive, transformative M&A with significant and consistent capital returns to shareholders.
M&A and Balance Sheet: Management has shown a clear willingness to use its balance sheet to acquire strategic, high-growth assets. In 2024, the firm deployed $2.9 billion in cash for the GIP acquisition . Concurrently, it raised $5.5 billion in long-term borrowings, in part to fund the cash considerations for the pending HPS and Preqin acquisitions, which are central to the new 2030 strategy .
Shareholder Returns: This aggressive investment was executed without sacrificing shareholder returns. In fiscal year 2024, BlackRock returned a total of $4.7 billion to shareholders . This return was composed of $3.1 billion in cash dividends and $1.9 billion in share repurchases, of which $1.6 billion was conducted via open market transactions .
The ability to simultaneously fund a multi-billion-dollar M&A strategy with both cash and debt while executing a robust $4.7 billion capital return program signals deep management confidence in the firm's durable free cash flow generation and the highly accretive nature of its acquisitions. This demonstrates a textbook exemplary approach: deploying capital to its highest-return use (strategic M&A) while continuing to reward the long-term shareholder base.

ESG Risk

BlackRock has a Low ESG Risk Rating of 18.59, as assessed by Sustainalytics . This score places the company in the 16th percentile globally, indicating low exposure and strong management of material ESG issues. The "Low" risk category is defined by a score between 10-19.99 .
Material ESG Issues (MEIs):
Product Governance & Business Ethics: As the world's largest fiduciary, BlackRock's primary ESG risk relates to how it manages conflicts of interest, ensures product transparency, and acts in the best interest of its clients .
Human Capital: The firm's "1BLK Platform" strategy and its technology leadership are entirely dependent on its ability to attract and retain elite talent in a highly competitive global market.
Data Privacy & Security: The Aladdin platform is a critical piece of financial infrastructure. A breach of its data security would represent a severe operational and reputational failure.
Climate-Related Risk: The 2024 10-K explicitly details climate-related risks. These include "transition risks" arising from divergent and evolving global climate policies, and "physical risks" from extreme weather events . The firm's scale and its role as a "universal owner" expose it to significant reputational and compliance risk from differing stakeholder perspectives on climate .

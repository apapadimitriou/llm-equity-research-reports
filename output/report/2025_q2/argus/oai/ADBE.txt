Dividend remains token ($0.01/qtr) – essentially negligible yield. Payout and repurchases support EPS growth.  
• **Guidance:** Raised FY’25 total revenue to $23.50–23.60 b (prev. $23.30–23.55 b) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=The%20following%20updated%20table%20summarizes,which%20assumes%20current%20macroeconomic%20conditions2)) and non-GAAP EPS to $20.50–20.70 (prev. $20.20–20.50) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=The%20following%20updated%20table%20summarizes,which%20assumes%20current%20macroeconomic%20conditions2)), reflecting Q2 beat and “AI innovation momentum” per management ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20result%20of%20us,%E2%80%9D)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-adoption-ai-powered-tools-2025-06-12/#:~:text=Adobe%20has%20raised%20its%20full,attributes%20this%20positive%20momentum%20to)).

• **Market Reaction:** Stock fell ~7% post-Q2 amid investor skepticism on near-term AI monetization, despite raised guide ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-shares-slide-investors-skeptical-quicker-ai-adoption-returns-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Adobe%20shares%20dropped%207,tool%2C%20has%20pressured%20the%20stock)). P/E (~19x) remains below creative-software peer Autodesk (~29x) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-shares-slide-investors-skeptical-quicker-ai-adoption-returns-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Consequently%2C%20at%20least%20five%20brokerages,16)). Notable reports (CFRA, RBC) cite AI competition and timeline uncertainty as risks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-shares-slide-investors-skeptical-quicker-ai-adoption-returns-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Adobe%20shares%20dropped%207,their%20price%20targets%20for%20Adobe%27s)).  

**Investment Thesis:** Adobe’s broad portfolio (Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, Experience Cloud) and leading brand position it to benefit from secular digital transformation. Recurring-subscription model yields high margins (~45% non-GAAP OI) and strong free cash flow generation. AI (e.g. Firefly, Copilot agents) is expected to enhance value, creating a $large market for generative content; Adobe has integrated OpenAI/Google models to Firefly ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-adds-ai-models-openai-google-its-firefly-app-2025-04-24/#:~:text=Adobe%20announced%20the%20integration%20of,various%20models%20within%20Firefly%20and)) and announced AI agents for Microsoft 365 (Adobe Marketing Agent, Express Agent) to embed Adobe tech in business workflows ([news.adobe.com](https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/03/adobe-and-microsoft-empower-marketers-with-ai-agents-in-microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=LAS%20VEGAS%20%E2%80%94%20March%2018%2C,Word%20through%20Microsoft%20365%20Copilot)). These innovations should improve retention and upsell, expanding addressable market. Adobe remains committed to sizeable buybacks (>$6 b/yr recent) and begun a small dividend, underscoring shareholder-friendly cash deployment. Near-term catalysts include continued enterprise digital experience growth and new AI-driven product launches (e.g. Firefly enhancements, Summit announcements).  

**Recent Developments:**  
• Q2’25 earnings (Jun 12) – beat revenue/earnings; raised FY25 guide ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Adobe%20achieved%20record%20revenue%20of,GAAP%20basis)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20%20,GAAP%3A%20%2420.50%20to%20%2420.70)). Non-GAAP EPS and revenue both beat consensus ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-adoption-ai-powered-tools-2025-06-12/#:~:text=public%20domain%20images%2C%20supports%20brand,AI%20innovation%20and%20value%20creation)). Segments all grew mid-teens.  (Table shows Q2 highlights.)  
• Partnerships – March 2025: Expanded AI integration with Microsoft (preview of Adobe Marketing Agent, Express Agent in Copilot) ([news.adobe.com](https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/03/adobe-and-microsoft-empower-marketers-with-ai-agents-in-microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=LAS%20VEGAS%20%E2%80%94%20March%2018%2C,Word%20through%20Microsoft%20365%20Copilot)). Also with Google/OpenAI for Firefly (integrated GPT/Image models) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-adds-ai-models-openai-google-its-firefly-app-2025-04-24/#:~:text=Adobe%20announced%20the%20integration%20of,various%20models%20within%20Firefly%20and)). Entered global alliance with Publicis on Firefly generative AI ([www.adobe.com](https://www.adobe.com/investor-relations/investor-news.html#:~:text=Publicis%20Groupe%20and%20Adobe%20Expand,with%20Adobe%20Firefly%20Generative%20AI)).  
• Product launches – at Adobe Summit 2025 (Mar): AI features across Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud (e.g. GenStudio for marketing, expanded Firefly mobile) per PR ([news.adobe.com](https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/03/adobe-and-microsoft-empower-marketers-with-ai-agents-in-microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Adobe%20Express%20Agent%20for%20Microsoft,365%20Copilot)) ([news.adobe.com](https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/03/adobe-and-microsoft-empower-marketers-with-ai-agents-in-microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Adobe%20Marketing%20Agent%20for%20Microsoft,365%20Copilot)). Document Cloud continuing growth (e-signature).  
• Capital returns – share buybacks continue (8.6 M shares Q2) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Adobe%20repurchased%20approximately%208,shares%20during%20the%20quarter)). Dividend maintained (currently ~$0.04 annual). No debt; cash ~$5b (down q/q after buybacks) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,2%2C072)).  
• Regulatory/Legal – no major surprises on record; risk factors from filings unchanged. Ongoing focus on IP/licensing (copyright assurance in Firefly fixes commitments).  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** Adobe’s revenue growth comes from net adds/pricing in Creative Cloud + Document services (Digital Media) and expanding cross-sell in Experience Cloud. We model FY25 rev +10% (to ~$23.55 b), with Digital Media ~+11% and DX ~+9%, reflecting stable subscription momentum and modest pricing. Operating leverage should come from scale and efficiency: Q2 non-GAAP OI margin ~46%, guiding ~46% FY, up from ~45% last year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20%20,GAAP%3A%20%2420.50%20to%20%2420.70)). Share repurchases (targeting ~1-2% reduction annually) imply EPS growth (~15-17% CAGR in FY24-25) outpacing revenue growth. The  FY25 EPS bridge (non-GAAP) is driven by ~10% rev growth + ~50bp margin lift - minimal dilution.  We expect FY24–FY25 non-GAAP EPS rising from ~$22.45 to ~$20.60 in guidance (i.e., sequential schedule) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=The%20following%20updated%20table%20summarizes,which%20assumes%20current%20macroeconomic%20conditions2)). Key drivers: strong renewal base (ARR ~$18b+ in EoQ2), enterprise digital spending, plus incremental AI revenue (e.g. Firefly credits, new analytics services). Cost base will see continued investment in R&D (AI) but should leverage incremental revenue.  

| | FY2022A | FY2023A | FY2024A | FY2025E | Q2 FY2025 |  
|:--|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|  
|Revenue ($M) | 17,606 | 19,409 | 21,505 | 23,550 | 5,873 |

*Figures per company filings; FY25E based on mid-point guidance.*  

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** Key peers include Microsoft (market cap ~$2.8t, 1-yr EPS growth ~22%, FY26E P/E ~30x, non-GAAP margin ~37%, Rating: Buy), Salesforce ( ~$200b, EPS jump range, P/E ~70x after recent profit rebound, margin ~10%, Hold), Autodesk (~$40b, EPS +22%, P/E ~50x, Buy). Adobe sits in the digital experience/software niche; it is growthier than traditional software (NetEase, Oracle) but slower than consumer Internet. On a PEG basis, Adobe’s blend of mid-teens growth and mid-teens P/E is attractive vs. expensiveness of peers like Autodesk. In a Value–Growth map, Adobe trends toward Growth (solid top-line growth, heavy R&D) but with Value attributes (generating free cash, below-peer P/E).  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** Adobe’s balance sheet is strong: ~$4.9b cash & equivalents + ~$0.8b short-term investments (Q2’25) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,2%2C072)). No significant debt. Working capital is positive (deferred revenue > current liabilities). We rate Financial Strength as **High** (ample liquidity, low leverage, strong cash flow). The company yields minimal dividends (~$0.04/yr, <0.02% yield). Payout ratio negligible; capital return via buybacks ($3–4 b/yr run-rate, 1-2% float) is more material. Dividend policy has been introduced but remains minimal; no recent hikes beyond inflation. Share count is trending down (~4–5% off a year), bolstering EPS.  

**Management & Risks:** CEO Shantanu Narayen (CEO since 2007) and CFO Dan Durn (since 2018) maintain long tenures; management communicates openly on strategy (AI focus) and provides detailed guidance. Key risk factors: macro/tech spending downturn could temper renewals (FY25 targets assume “current macro conditions” ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=1Targets%20assume%20non,third%20quarter%20fiscal%20year%202025))). Competition is intense: DIY and cloud-native rivals (e.g. Canva in creative; open-source/low-code AI tools) pose downside pressure. Monetizing AI innovations majorly (Firefly, GenStudio) may prove slower than expected ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-shares-slide-investors-skeptical-quicker-ai-adoption-returns-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Adobe%20shares%20dropped%207,tool%2C%20has%20pressured%20the%20stock)). Regulatory risks include evolving privacy/data laws and cross-border commerce rules (Adobe’s business is global). Geopolitical uncertainties (global supply chains, currency) and cybersecurity breaches are generic threats.  Cadence of subscription renewals could slow if corporate budgets tighten.  

• **Macro & Demand:** Economic weakness could delay enterprise marketing/spending, hurting Experience segment renewal rates (Adobe conservatively cites macro assumption) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000064/adbeex991q225.htm#:~:text=1Targets%20assume%20non,third%20quarter%20fiscal%20year%202025)).  
• **AI Execution:** If Adobe’s generative-AI tools (Firefly, Copilot agents) fail to quickly drive upsells, projected growth falls short; some analysts note this uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/adobe-shares-slide-investors-skeptical-quicker-ai-adoption-returns-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Adobe%20shares%20dropped%207,tool%2C%20has%20pressured%20the%20stock)).  
• **Competition:** Larger tech (Microsoft, Google) and niche startups (Canva, Figma, Midjourney) compete in creative/marketing space.  
• **Integration/M&A:** Transformations or M&A (like 2021 Figma bid) risk execution and capital. Also Introduction of new tax or trade regulations could raise costs.  
• **Valuation:** High valuation partially justified by growth; any missteps or weaker guidance could Impair share price.  

**Company Description:** Adobe is a leading provider of creative and document software, with two main operating segments: *Digital Media* (Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop, Illustrator; Document Cloud services) and *Digital Experience* (Experience Cloud marketing and analytics tools). It serves both individual creators and large enterprises globally through subscription licensing models ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/adobe-rolls-out-ai-agents-online-marketing-tools-2025-03-18/#:~:text=Adobe%20has%20announced%20the%20rollout,agents%20allow%20brands%20to%20tailor)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ADBE/adobe/market-cap#:~:text=Sector%20%20,readers%2C%20and)). Adobe’s platform enables content creation, management, delivery and optimization across digital channels, positioning it at the intersection of digital media and marketing technologies. It holds strong brand franchises (Photoshop, Acrobat, Magento, Marketo) and leverages data/AI to personalize digital experiences.  

**Valuation:** Our target $450 (≈22× FY25E non-GAAP EPS, ~7.5× sales) is set by peer/comparison and historical benchmarks. This implies slight reversion toward Adobe’s 5-yr avg P/E (~20–22×) given accelerating AI-driven growth. It modestly exceeds current ~19× because we anticipate renewed growth execution. Relative to peers, Adobe’s P/E stays below Microsoft’s but above slower-growth IT firms. A DCF using consensus growth (10% revenue CAGR) & 8% terminal gives a similar mid-$400s fair value. Upside catalysts (faster AI monetization, beat estimates) could drive re-rating; downside if growth falters. A sustained share-price close above our target (triggering rating upgrade) would require >6% organic growth beats or structurally quicker AI revenue. Conversely, any sharp guidance cut or margin miss would test our BUY rating.  

**Ratings Reference:** **BUY** – expects outperformance of major indices on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 mo., due to favorable fundamentals and valuation gap. (By contrast, **HOLD** denotes expected in-line performance; **SELL** implies underperformance.)  
Long-term (5-yr) S/T Stance: BUY (favors growth/innovation in secular tailwinds). Sector Stance: Market-Weight (Technology sector).  

**Methodology & Disclaimers:**  Our opinion is derived from holistic fundamental analysis, combining macro industry trends and bottom-up financial modeling. We assess growth prospects (addressable market, product adoption), margins and cash flow, and financial strength. We also weight management quality, strategy execution, and risk factors (competition, regulation, macro). Target price is supported by discounted cash flows and relative valuation vs. peers.

Sector: Technology – Hardware/Devices (Sector Stance: **Overweight**)  
Financial Strength: **High** (robust cash flow, manageable leverage)  

## Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q2 results:** Apple delivered strong Q2 FY2025 (ended Mar 29, ’25) results, with revenue $95.4 B (+5% Y/Y) and EPS $1.65 (+8%) ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%C2%A0Apple%20today%20announced%20financial,8%20percent%20year%20over%20year)). Services hit a new record; iPhone sales were modestly higher and new Mac/iPad products lifted computer revenues.  
• **Cash returns:** Operating cash flow was ~$24 B, enabling $29 B returned to shareholders in Q2 ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20March%20quarter%20business%20performance,to%20our%20high%20levels%20of)). The board raised the quarterly dividend 4% to $0.26 ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)) and approved an additional $100 B buyback program ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)). Share count is shrinking through aggressive repurchases.  
• **Ecosystem momentum:** Apple’s active installed base reached all-time highs ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=shareholders%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Kevan%20Parekh%2C%20Apple%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D)), reflecting very high customer loyalty. Services (App Store, Apple Pay, etc.) and Wearables continue double-digit growth, offsetting a mid-single-digit decline in Wearables this quarter.  
• **Supply-chain & AI:** Management noted that most iPhones to be sold in the U.S. this quarter will be made in India ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/apple-earnings-beat-services-growth#:~:text=the%20App%20Store,to%20be%20manufactured%20in%20India)), mitigating proposed tariffs. Apple Intelligence (AI on-device) and Vision Pro rollouts are expected to drive upgrade demand. Morgan Stanley predicts nearly 500M iPhones over 2 years with AI features boosting refresh rates ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-gains-after-morgan-stanley-calls-stock-top-pick-ai-efforts-2024-07-15/#:~:text=Stanley%20noted%20that%20this%20new,enabled%20smartphones%27%20market%20recovery)).  
• **Regulatory/Trade:** Investors remain cautious on policy risks. A U.S. court ruling will compel Apple to allow alternative app purchasing outside the App Store ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/apple-earnings-beat-services-growth#:~:text=%241,revenue%20streams%20if%20developers%20bypass)), which may compress services revenue. New U.S. tariffs (25% on non-U.S. iPhones) briefly hit the stock ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-flat-debt-worries-markets-mull-trumps-tax-bill-2025-05-23/#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20proposed%20significant,markets%20ahead%20of%20the%20Memorial)), but Apple’s global manufacturing strategy partially hedges this.  

## Investment Thesis  
Apple is a global leader in premium consumer electronics and software. Its massive (≈2+ billion) installed base drives recurring service revenues and high accessory attach rates. The ecosystem (iOS/macOS/wearables) creates strong lock-in: even in a saturated smartphone market, Apple can eke out mid-single-digit unit growth thanks to frequent refresh cycles and global market expansion. High-margin software and services (App Store, iCloud, subscriptions, financial services) now account for ≈28% of sales ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=iPad%20%20,)), providing steady earnings and cash flow that are less cyclical than hardware. Apple's gross margins (~47% in Q2 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Total%20gross%20margin%20%20,97%2C126))) and operating margins (~30% level) remain among the highest in tech, thanks to efficient supply-chain and premium pricing. The company converts a large portion of revenue into free cash flow (~$86B ttm ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics/?fr=sycsrp_catchall%2F#:~:text=Operating%20Cash%20Flow%20,86.16B))) and actively returns capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks (existing $300B+ program).  

Looking ahead, secular growth vectors include the rollout of **Apple Intelligence** (AI-powered features) to boost device upgrades ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-gains-after-morgan-stanley-calls-stock-top-pick-ai-efforts-2024-07-15/#:~:text=Apple%27s%20%28AAPL,this%20year%2C%20reaching%20%24236.30)), and new product categories (augmented reality/VR with Vision Pro and beyond). Services expansion (increasing ARPU per device) and emerging-market penetration (notably India manufacturing) offer upside. Even absent major catalysts, Apple’s scale and cash generation justify a premium multiple. We assume continued mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth in FY25 driven by hardware/software synergies. Regulatory actions (e.g. App Store adjustments) or trade skirmishes remain watchpoints, but our thesis is built on Apple’s dominant ecosystem, robust margins, and shareholder-aligned capital return policy.

## Recent Developments  
• **Fiscal 2025 Q2 earnings:** Reported May 1, 2025: Rev. $95.4 B (+5% Y/Y), GAAP EPS $1.65 (+8%) ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20CALIFORNIA%C2%A0Apple%20today%20announced%20financial,8%20percent%20year%20over%20year)). Services revenue hit an all-time high; CEO Cook highlighted Apple Intelligence and record active devices ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CToday%20Apple%20is%20reporting%20strong,%E2%80%9D)).  
• **Capital return:** Board declared $0.26 dividend (+4%) ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)) and authorized an additional $100 B stock buyback ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock)). Q2 cash flow $24 B enabled $29 B shareholder return ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20March%20quarter%20business%20performance,to%20our%20high%20levels%20of)). On May 5, Apple issued $5–6 B in bonds (first in 2 years) to fund buybacks and debt repayment ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/apples-first-bond-offering-two-years-headlines-busy-primary-2025-05-05/#:~:text=On%20May%205%2C%202025%2C%20Apple,recent%20tightening%20of%20credit%20spreads)).  
• **Trade/tariff news:** On May 23, President Trump proposed a 25% U.S. tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., briefly knocking Apple shares ~3% lower ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-flat-debt-worries-markets-mull-trumps-tax-bill-2025-05-23/#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20proposed%20significant,markets%20ahead%20of%20the%20Memorial)). Management noted supply-chain shifts (increased iPhone production in India) to limit tariff impact ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/apple-earnings-beat-services-growth#:~:text=the%20App%20Store,to%20be%20manufactured%20in%20India)).  
• **Antitrust/regulatory updates:** A federal court ordered Apple to allow app developers to offer alternative in-app payment links beyond the App Store (as part of Epic litigation) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/apple-earnings-beat-services-growth#:~:text=%241,revenue%20streams%20if%20developers%20bypass)). The EU’s Digital Markets Act also targets Apple’s App Store; in late June Apple agreed to allow third-party app stores in Europe to avoid fines.  
• **Management changes:** Former FP&A head Kevan Parekh was appointed CFO starting Jan 2025, succeeding Luca Maestri ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-finance-chief-luca-maestri-step-down-2024-08-26/#:~:text=Apple%20has%20announced%20that%20veteran,management%20and%20may%20explore%20additional)). The transition was positioned as orderly with Parekh maintaining conservative capital management. Cook remains CEO (since 2011).  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Apple’s ~5% YOY revenue rise in Q2 was powered by new-product upgrades while combating currency effects. iPhone sales rose ~2% in Q2 (stronger iPhone 16e demand) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm)); Mac (+7%) and iPad (+15%) benefited from new Apple-Silicon models ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Mac%20%20,)), but Wearables (Watch, AirPods) were down ~5% as consumer demand normalized. Services grew ~12% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=iPad%20%20,)) (advertising, App Store, cloud, etc.), hitting another record. Geographically, the Americas led growth, Europe was flat, and Greater China sales declined (weaker iPhone demand + FX) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=)).  

Operationally, gross margin ticked up to ~47.1% in Q2 (vs 46.6% last year) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Total%20gross%20margin%20%20,97%2C126)), as favorable costs offset product mix and currency headwinds. Operating expenses rose modestly: R&D +8% (9% of sales) and SG&A +5% (7% of sales) in H1 (driven by headcount and marketing for AI launches) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Research%20and%20development%20%20,28%2C853)). Thus operating margin held around ~30% of sales. After-tax EPS benefited from both modest operating leverage and share count reduction (buybacks removing ~1–2% of float annually). Weighted‐average diluted shares fell to ~15.2B in Q2.  

We forecast FY2025 (ends 9/25) revenue ~+5–6% Y/Y and EPS ~+$7.2, slightly above consensus ~$6.8, reflecting continued services strength and normalized iPhone sell-through. Below is our summary of key metrics:  

|                    | FY2021  | FY2022  | FY2023  | Q2 FY2025 |

*(FY = Apple fiscal year ended Sept. Latest quarter = Q2 FY2025)*  

**Earnings growth:** Apple’s EPS rose ~9% in FY24 vs FY23 (reflecting Q4 last Oct). We expect continued mid-single-digit EPS growth in FY25. The EPS bridge is driven by ~5% revenue growth (mostly from higher‐margin services and computers) and stable margins, partly offset by FX and higher R&D. Share repurchases (roughly 1%+ of shares shrunk per quarter) and a stable ~13% effective tax rate (unchanged) bolster net income.  

## Peer & Industry Analysis  
**Peer group:** Apple’s closest peers span Big Tech and hardware. For context: Microsoft (mkt cap ~$3.8T) trades ~27x P/E with ~10–15% EPS growth, operating margin ~40%, and is rated HOLD. Alphabet/Google (~$2.5T) is ~25x, ~20% EPS growth, ~29% margin (HOLD). Samsung Electronics (~$600B) is ~15x, flat-to-negative EPS growth (memory cyclical) and ~10% margin (HOLD). Meta Platforms (~$500B) trades ~30x with ~20% earnings growth, ~30% margin (HOLD).  

**Apple’s position:** On valuation, Apple (~30x forward P/E) sits between high-growth “Magnificent Seven” and slower-earnings wireless companies. Its 5-year avg P/E (~27x) ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics/?fr=sycsrp_catchall%2F#:~:text=Trailing%20P%2FE%20%20,49.08)) is below current levels, reflecting a period of tepid growth; our target assumes Apple reverts toward the mid-20s with higher earnings. In *growth vs. value* space, Apple is a blend: it offers steadier growth than legacy hardware peers but trades at lower multiples than high-flying cloud/AI names. Profitability (30% O/M) exceeds most FAAMG except Microsoft, leaning toward a “quality” value anchor. Overall, Apple straddles value (for its size/cash flow) and growth (services/innovation tailwinds).  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
Apple’s balance sheet remains solid. At March 2025: Cash + marketable securities ~$48.5 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,32%2C833)); total debt ~$84.5 B (commercial paper + long-term notes) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Total%20current%20liabilities%20%20,45%2C888)). Net debt (~$36 B) is low relative to $385 B revenue. Debt/Equity (~100–110%) is elevated but largely due to buybacks; interest coverage is excellent given ~$86 B FCF (ttm) ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics/?fr=sycsrp_catchall%2F#:~:text=Operating%20Cash%20Flow%20,86.16B)). The company carries a high credit rating. Apple’s high FCF coverage and liquidity underpin our **High** financial-strength rating.  

Dividend policy is shareholder-friendly but modest yield. The current yield (~0.5%) comes from quarterly payouts ($1.00 annually–recently $0.26/qtr ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%E2%80%99s%20board%20of%20directors%20has,of%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20common%20stock))). The dividend has grown ~4% annually on average; Apple’s payout ratio is low (≈15%). We expect continued ~5% annual dividend hikes with ongoing buybacks. Backed by ~$190 B remaining authorization, repurchases will continue to reduce share count (likely 1–2%/yr in FY25), extending EPS support.  

## Management & Risks  
• **Management:** Tim Cook (CEO, since 2011) remains at the helm, guiding product strategy and capital allocation. New CFO Kevan Parekh (ex-VP of FP&A) took over Jan 2025, ensuring continuity in financial oversight ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-finance-chief-luca-maestri-step-down-2024-08-26/#:~:text=Apple%20has%20announced%20that%20veteran,management%20and%20may%20explore%20additional)). Governance and disclosures are robust (quarterly calls, annual 10-K). Key executives have long tenure, implying stability.  

• **Competitive:** The smartphone market is intensely competitive. Samsung and Chinese makers undercut margins in Asia; Google/Meta also push AR/AI into devices. Any failure to execute (e.g. a lukewarm iPhone launch) could immediately pressure sales. Similarly, shifts in consumer preference (e.g. to non-Apple platforms) would be detrimental.  

• **Regulatory/Legal:** Apple faces a wave of antitrust scrutiny. Pending and recent rulings (App Store payment limits ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/01/apple-earnings-beat-services-growth#:~:text=%241,revenue%20streams%20if%20developers%20bypass)), EU fines) threaten its lucrative services fees. Telecom regulations and privacy laws (e.g. digital services acts) could force more openness. Any hefty fines or mandates to give third-party apps more freedom could cut into Services revenue.  

• **Macro/Geopolitical:** Apple’s results are sensitive to trade policy and foreign economies. New tariffs (U.S. or abroad) on electronics, or a stronger dollar, would pinch margins and bookings. Greater China (≈15% of sales) is a key risk: it saw slowing demand and regulatory uncertainty (uncited). Political tensions (Taiwan/China) also pose supply-chain risks. Global recessions or consumer cutbacks would hit discretionary device sales.  

• **Supply chain:** Apple relies on complex global suppliers (e.g. TSMC, Foxconn). Component shortages or plant disruptions (COVID or conflict) could delay production. Currency swings (weak non-US currencies) have already trimmed reported sales ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000057/aapl-20250329.htm#:~:text=Greater%20China%20net%20sales%20decreased,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202025)).  

• **Innovation:** Apple must continually innovate. Slower adoption of AI features (so far behind rivals) or a botched new product could stall upgrades. Long development cycles for major products (like Vision Pro) mean missteps or delays could leave Apple behind in emerging tech.  

## Company Description  
Apple Inc. is a leading technology company renowned for its consumer electronics and integrated ecosystem ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%20revolutionized%20personal%20technology%20with,better%20than%20we%20found%20it)). Its flagship products include the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet, Mac computers, Apple Watch, AirPods, and the new Apple Vision Pro headset. Apple also develops software platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS) and provides services (App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple TV+, etc.) that work seamlessly across its devices. The company sells products and services worldwide through retail and online stores, with over 150,000 employees globally ([www.apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/#:~:text=Apple%20revolutionized%20personal%20technology%20with,better%20than%20we%20found%20it)). Fiscal 2023 revenue was ~$383B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000106/aapl-20230930.htm?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed#:~:text=,)), with well-established brand loyalty and a vast installed base driving recurring sales.  

## Valuation  
We value Apple using both a comparables multiple approach and a discounted cash flow. At our $250 target (mid-2026), Apple’s shares would trade at ≈30× our FY2026 EPS (above its 5-year avg ~27× ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics/?fr=sycsrp_catchall%2F#:~:text=Trailing%20P%2FE%20%20,49.08)) but justified by resilient FCF and services tailwinds). This is roughly in line with high-quality tech peers (e.g. Microsoft ~27×, Alphabet ~25×). Our DCF (WACC ~7%, 2-3% terminal growth) yields a similar fair value. The target P/E implies moderate premium over history, reflecting Apple’s continued double-digit free cash yield (~5%) and strong balance sheet.  

**Investment risks/upside:** Upside to our target would come from faster-than-expected adoption of new products (e.g. Vision Pro, Apple Intelligence), superior China demand, or accelerated share repurchases. Downside risks include weaker iPhone volumes, prolonged trade barriers, or deeper regulatory penalties. A sustained shortfall in sales/guidance would pressure the multiple. We would downgrade to HOLD if growth decelerates below industry or regulatory/legal headwinds intensify; conversely, we would upgrade if Apple builds new high-growth franchises that materially raise its growth and return profile.  

## Ratings Reference  
We define our 12-month ratings on a relative performance basis vs. a broad index: **BUY** = expected to outperform (higher return per unit risk), **HOLD** = expected to perform roughly in line, **SELL** = expected to underperform. Our 12-month rating is **BUY** (reflecting expected outperformance of the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis) and our five-year outlook (long-term) is **Outperform**. Sector stance is **Overweight** (Apple is a core tech holding for balanced growth/yield).

## Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis combines a top-down view of the tech industry (market trends, competition, macroeconomic factors) with bottom-up financial modeling (revenue assumptions, margin projections, balance sheet analysis). We assess management credibility, regulatory environment, and capital-return plans, then derive a fair valuation by comparing to peers and through discounted cash flow models. All forecasts and opinions are our own. This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy/sell securities.

• **Pipeline & Catalysts:**  Moderna has filed key next-gen vaccines with FDA: the 4th-generation COVID booster (mRNA-1283) and an RSV shot for high-risk adults (mRNA-1345), with PDUFA targets May 31 and June 12, 2025 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,date%20of%20May%2031%2C%202025)).

A Phase 3 universal flu mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1010) is underway, with interim analyses due summer ’25, and CMV and norovirus vaccine Phase 3s are progressing.  Management touts a broad vaccine pipeline (28 candidates across respiratory and other viruses ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Advances-Multiple-Vaccine-Programs-to-Late-Stage-Clinical-Trials/default.aspx#:~:text=considerable%20health%20burdens%20and%20includes,respiratory%2C%20latent%20and%20other%20pathogens))) and advancing oncology mRNA therapies, including Merck-partnered cancer vaccines (e.g. mRNA-4157 or “intismeran”).  In H1’25 Moderna also expects multiple late-stage clinical readouts and submissions (e.g. U.S. RSV ACIP recommendation, oncology).

No dividend is paid; Moderna authorized a multi-billion share repurchase (a $3B program in 2022 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-beats-on-q2-earnings-starts-%243b-buyback-program#:~:text=Share%20Buyback))) and has repurchased ~$2.9B through Q3’23 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates--/default.aspx?ref=upstract.com#:~:text=Repurchase%20of%20common%20stock%2C%20including,)).  

**Investment Thesis:**  Moderna pioneered mRNA vaccines and retains a large, diversified R&D portfolio beyond its COVID franchise.  *Secular Growth:*  The mRNA platform addresses vast infectious disease markets. Moderna’s pipeline includes second-gen COVID boosters, RSV for older adults, combination flu/COVID vaccines, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and norovirus shots, and several cancer immunotherapies.  For example, its CMV program targets a ~$5B market (common congenital infection), and RSV boosters target an ~60M elderly population.  An eventual approval of these vaccines could re-accelerate modal revenue growth.  Late-stage pipeline breadth (28 vaccine candidates ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Advances-Multiple-Vaccine-Programs-to-Late-Stage-Clinical-Trials/default.aspx#:~:text=considerable%20health%20burdens%20and%20includes,respiratory%2C%20latent%20and%20other%20pathogens))) and breakthrough designations (e.g. RSV) support a multiyear outlook.  

*Margin and Cash Flow:*  Historically, Moderna’s ~75–80% gross margins (when volumes scale) and strong government/tender revenues have driven outsized profits (FY’22 EPS $20.12) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx?ref=svtv.org#:~:text=Fourth%20quarter%202022%20revenues%20of,61)).  Today margins are depressed by low COVID volumes and one-time charges, but cost cuts (manufacturing resize, inventory writedowns behind us) should improve margins in 2024–25.  The business is FCF-rich once R&D moderate.  Its $8–9B cash hoard ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Cash%20Position%3A%20Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents,operating%20loss%20for%20this%20quarter)) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Cash%20Position%3A%20Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents,timing%20of%20accounts%20receivable%20collections)) gives optionality (internal development or partnerships) and underpins the Medium-High financial strength rating.  No near-term dividend is expected given investment needs; instead shareholders are protected by buybacks (recent $3B repurchase authorization ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates--/default.aspx?ref=upstract.com#:~:text=Repurchase%20of%20common%20stock%2C%20including,))).  

*Catalysts:*  Near-term upside hinges on successful regulatory approvals (next-gen COVID and RSV PDUFAs in H1’25). An approval of Moderna’s RSV (where Pfizer and GSK have limited uptake so far) or favorable ACIP guidance could boost uptake.  Securing tender contracts (e.g. a recent tender in Australia) or EU market share could also lift sales.  Conversely, continued cost discipline and pipeline progress raise fair value.  We remain watchful of management’s ability to convert pipeline milestones into products; any clinical failures or long delays in key programs (e.g., the next-gen combo vaccine) would moderate our outlook.

R&D and SG&A expense cuts narrowed the loss.  Guidance for 2025 sales ($1.5–2.5B) and cash ~$6B is unchanged ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Reiterates%202025%20expected%20revenue%20range,balance%20of%20approximately%20%246%20billion)).  The stock dipped ~5% on the revenue miss (per news reports) but rose modestly in subsequent sessions.

It shared positive Phase 3 data at conferences for RSV (in 18–59 high-risk adults) and flu vaccine immunogenicity.  However, Moderna now expects FDA to demand a full Phase 3 efficacy readout for its combo flu/COVID shot (mRNA-1083)—pushing a decision into 2026 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,now%20targeting%20approval%20in%202026)).  (By contrast, an FDA advisory panel recently voted to recommend Pfizer’s bivalent COVID booster in 2024.) 

• **Cost Savings:** Management announced expanded cost‐cutting targets: GAAP opex ~$5.4–5.7B in 2026 (down from prior $5.9B target) and $4.7–5.0B in 2027 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Moderna%20is%20expanding%20its%20cost,compared%20to%20its%202025%20estimate)), implying ~$1.4–1.7B in annual savings by 2027 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Announces%20reduction%20of%20%241,GAAP%20operating%20costs%20by%202027)).  Q1’25 operating costs were $0.1B (COGS) + $1.1B (R&D+SG&A), down from $1.3B a year ago.  

• **Commercial:** Moderna is competing in global vaccine tenders.  It is one of several suppliers in the EU emergency program (up to 36M doses/yr) ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=In%20the%20European%20Union%2C%20Moderna,for%20up%20to%20four%20years)) and recently secured contracts in countries like Brazil.  Its RSV shot (mRESVIA) has begun to roll out abroad (some 60+ markets approved).

No long-term debt is reported. Management is maintaining its ~$6B year-end cash goal.  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:**  Moderna’s revenues are now driven almost entirely by respiratory franchise vaccines (Spikevax and new mRSV).

_Chart: Sales growth has decelerated sharply as Moderna’s COVID rollout shifted to seasonal patterns.  Cost reductions have improved operating leverage but losses widen until volumes recover._  

For FY2025, we expect revenues in the mid–high end ($2.0–2.5B, assuming seasonal Winter > Summer) and continued GAAP losses (block memory of 2025 at –$10 EPS).  Key assumptions: modest RSV uptake given older‐adult market, some US COVID demand, flat pricing internationally, and firm R&D cuts.  The EPS bridge from -$9.28 (FY’24) to ~-10.15 FY’25 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-expect-modernas-q1-2025-earnings-report#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20analysts%20forecast,per%20share%20in%20fiscal%202024)) reflects these factors (see “risks” below).  

**Peer & Industry Analysis:**  As a pure-play mRNA vaccine company, Moderna lies at the far growth end of the biotech spectrum.  Highly diversified peers in large‐cap pharma (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson) trade at mid‐teens P/E with stable dividend yields, reflecting established products.  By contrast, high-growth biotech peers are also unprofitable: for example, BioNTech (BNTX) has a market cap ~$26.8B and negative EPS (zero P/E) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/stock-price-history#:~:text=,0.00)), and smaller RNA/biotech names like Gilead (GILD) and Amgen (AMGN) trade around 15× earnings ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/stock-price-history#:~:text=,0.00)).  In our view, Moderna’s profile is closer to a growth‐company (like BNTX) than a value‐biotech.  It must continually invest in EBIT‐negative R&D to drive future sales. Copper to those peers, MRNA’s price/sales (~4×) and price/book (~1.2×) are reasonable given the business stage.  On a risk-adjusted basis we rate MRNA *Neutral* (HOLD) relative to this group: its op. margins and earnings should improve over time, but current profitability is far below peers, and upside depends on execution of novel vaccines.  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:**  Moderna’s balance sheet is exceptionally strong by biotech standards.  It held $8.4B cash/investments at Q1’25 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Cash%20Position%3A%20Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents,operating%20loss%20for%20this%20quarter)) (≈30% of market cap), with no significant debt.  Working capital is positive (~$6B) and funded historically by advance purchase agreements.  We view the financial risk as low.  No dividends have been declared (yield 0%).  The Board has authorized large share repurchases (a $3B program started in 2022 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-mrna-beats-on-q2-earnings-starts-%243b-buyback-program#:~:text=Share%20Buyback))), and ~$2.9B of buybacks were executed through Q3’23 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates--/default.aspx?ref=upstract.com#:~:text=Repurchase%20of%20common%20stock%2C%20including,)), which should modestly reduce float and support EPS.  We expect no change to the cash cushion in the near term and grade the financial strength Medium‐High given liquidity versus ongoing losses.  

• **Management:**  CEO Stéphane Bancel (co-founder, CEO since 2011) provides stable leadership; CFO James Mock (hired Aug 2022) has bolstered financial reporting.  Management has been explicit about cost targets, R&D pipelines, and sales outlook (via quarterly guidance).  We note board-level incentives and investor communications remain centered on long-term growth, with limited short-term guidance beyond financial framework ranges.  

• **Risks:**  Key risks include further declines in vaccine demand if COVID/RSV become mild endemic illnesses without renewed surges.  **Regulatory timing:** FDA may delay granting approvals (e.g., requiring a full Phase 3 for the combo flu/COVID shot has shifted that product into 2026 ([news.modernatx.com](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,now%20targeting%20approval%20in%202026))).  *ACIP/CDC recommendations* also affect market size: restrictive RSV guidance (e.g. excluding ages 60–74) has already dampened the initial market – Pfizer’s Abrysvo and GSK’s Arexvy saw Q1 sales drop on CDC limits ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moderna-beats-q1-earnings-lags-revenues-focuses-cost-cuts#:~:text=Notably%2C%20RSV%20vaccine%20sales%20have,74%20age%20bracket)).  **Competition:** Rival vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech, Novavax, Sanofi, etc.) and alternative approaches (monoclonals, older vaccines) may constrain Moderna’s pricing power or market share.  **Intellectual Property:** Moderna’s core mRNA/LNP technology faces patent pressure.  A U.S. patent on its lipid nanoparticle delivery was upheld for Arbutus Biopharma (PTAB declined to invalidate Arbutus’s LNP patent) ([www.genengnews.com](https://www.genengnews.com/news/moderna-eyes-appeal-as-board-upholds-an-arbutus-lipid-nanoparticle-patent/#:~:text=The%20PTAB%20turned%20back%20Moderna%E2%80%99s,art%20to%20which%C2%A0the%C2%A0subject%20matter%20pertains)), potentially exposing Moderna to infringement suits or royalties.  **Financial:** Continued losses necessitate cash burn; if revenue shrinks faster than cost savings, cash could dip below expectations.  **Macro:** Geopolitical or supply-chain issues (e.g. raw‐material availability, export restrictions on biologics) could delay production.  **Legal/Political:** Price scrutiny (e.g. government pressure on COVID vaccine profits) and immunization policy changes also present uncertainty.  

**Company Description:**  Moderna is a US biotechnology company (Cambridge, MA) specializing in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines.  Its leading products are the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and the newly approved RSV vaccine (mRESVIA) for older adults.  Moderna operates a global network of R&D and manufacturing facilities, focusing on infectious diseases (COVID, flu, RSV, CMV, etc.) and emerging areas such as oncology and rare diseases.  Its proprietary platform designs mRNA to instruct cells to produce therapeutic proteins or antigens.  The company has scaled from a clinical-stage start-up (est. 2010) to a commercial vaccine leader, with a large pipeline of late-stage candidates.  

**Valuation:**  Our $40 target uses a multiples-based approach calibrated to peers and the company’s growth profile.  This implies roughly 2.0× FY25 sales at the low end of guidance (or ~4.0× based on $2.0B sales), reflecting a discount to high-growth peers.  By comparison, large biotech/pharma peers trade at ~15–17× forward earnings ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/stock-price-history#:~:text=,0.00)); Moderna’s lack of near-term earnings and need for multi-year maturation warrant a lower multiple.  At a $40 price, Moderna would trade around 4.0× our FY25 revenue and ~2.0× FY25 book value (vs ~4.1× P/S and 1.2× P/B today).  Historically, the stock once traded north of 30× sales (during the pandemic surge), so our target implies a reversion toward more normalized biotech fundamentals.  Upside beyond our target would require faster-than-expected uptake of new vaccines or pipeline breakthroughs; conversely, further revenue weakness or clinical setbacks could push the stock lower.  

**Ratings Reference:**  *BUY* indicates expectation of market‐outperformance (12-month total return well above the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  *HOLD* denotes expectations of roughly market‐parallel total return (with no strong bias).  *SELL* implies projected underperformance.  For long-term perspective (5-year view) we note the stock’s high fundamental volatility amid product cycles: investors should be prepared for swings driven by clinical/data news.  Moderna is in the Healthcare/Biotechnology sector, which has a **Market Weight** stance given the transition from pandemic tailwinds to broader industry trends.  

**Methodology:**  Our analysis combines top-down industry outlook (mRNA market trends, public health policy, macro factors) with bottom-up modeling of Moderna’s P&L and cash flows.  We forecast revenues by product line, incorporate known guidance, and estimate expenses to derive earnings and cash flows.  Valuation uses both relative (peer multiples) and intrinsic (discounted cash flow) approaches, adjusted for Moderna’s pipeline risk.  We account for management credibility, financial strength, and execution risk.  Assumptions (market size, pricing, uptake) are clearly stated; this report is **not** investment advice, but our independent analysis and opinion, and actual results may differ materially from our projections.

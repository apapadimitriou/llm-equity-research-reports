# Analyst’s Notes  
- **Q2** Revenue $1.604B (+10% YoY) ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202025,quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202024)), driven by a 21% jump in Design IP sales and +6% in Design Automation ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Now%20on%20to%20our%20segments,2)). Non-GAAP EPS was $3.67 ($2.24 GAAP) ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=Non,quarter%20of%20fiscal%20year%202024)), above guided range. Operational leverage and cost discipline drove a 38% non-GAAP margin ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Sassine,Q2%20results%20and%20bond%20issuance)).  
- **Backlog & Demand** Backlog reached ~$8.1B (up $0.4B QoQ) ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Sassine,Q2%20results%20and%20bond%20issuance)), indicating sustained design activity. Robust AI/HPC-driven demand offset softness in China (~16% of sales) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/synopsys-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-largely-above-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=after,Korea%20helps%20mitigate%20the%20shortfall)). Management notes European and Korean strength offset U.S./China weakness; non-AI segments (automotive/industrial) are stable but below par.  
- **Guidance** Synopsys **reaffirmed** FY2025 revenue target ($6.745–$6.805B) and ~40% non-GAAP operating margin ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Now%20to%20guidance,expenses%20associated%20with%20our%20bond)). Strong Q1–Q2 execution led CFO to raise FY EPS outlook to ~$15.15 (midpoint) from prior ~$14.90 ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Now%20to%20guidance,expenses%20associated%20with%20our%20bond)). Q3 guidance of $1.755–$1.785B (vs. Street ~$1.76B) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/synopsys-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-largely-above-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=Synopsys%20projected%20its%20third,the%20second%20quarter%2C%20meeting%20expectations)) suggests continued mid-teens growth.  
- **Capital & M&A** A $10B bond sale (Feb 2025) was arranged to help fund the pending $35B Ansys acquisition ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/synopsys-prepares-about-10-billion-bond-sale-finance-ansys-deal-bloomberg-news-2025-02-28/#:~:text=Synopsys%20is%20planning%20to%20sell,taking%20over%20Ansys%2C%20which%20creates)). Regulators have cleared the Ansys deal in the EU and UK ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/uk-competition-regulator-clears-35-billion-synopsys-ansys-deal-2025-03-05/#:~:text=Britain%27s%20competition%20regulator%20has%20approved,proceed%20after%20concerns%20were%20addressed)); China approved in July 2025 ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/synopsys-acquires-simulation-specialist-ansys-for-usd35-billion-following-chinese-regulator-approval-merger-to-power-end-to-end-design-platform#:~:text=Synopsys%20has%20completed%20its%20%2435,aerospace%2C%20automotive%2C%20and%20industrial%20engineering)). Closing is expected mid-2025, creating a combined EDA+simulation platform. No significant buyback/dividend changes were announced; Synopsys remains net-cash-positive.  

# Investment Thesis  
Synopsys is the leading provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software and semiconductor IP, critical for next-generation chip development. **Secular drivers** (AI, HPC, 5G, IoT) are **reshaping chip complexity** – Synopsys cites “AI, software-defined systems, and silicon proliferation” as growth catalysts ([investor.synopsys.com](https://investor.synopsys.com/news/news-details/2025/Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2025#:~:text=,to%20help%20customers%20innovate%20faster)). Its tools address exploding design scale (2nm+ process nodes, 3D chips, multi-die systems), and Synopsys is integrating Generative AI into its workflow (e.g. Synopsys.ai Copilot cited at SNUG). These megatrends imply a large **addressable market** for design software and IP: major customers (Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, automotive chipmakers) continue to expand R&D budgets despite cyclicality ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/synopsys-quarterly-revenue-forecast-beats-estimates-rising-demand-chip-design-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Synopsys%20reported%20a%20revenue%20forecast,segments%20in%20the%20chip%20industry)) ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=I%27ll%20provide%20more%20details%20about,end%20market%20demand%20remains%20subdued)).  

The business model is high-margin and generates substantial FCF. Synopsys’ products are mission-critical (reported non-GAAP operating margins ~38–40%) ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Sassine,Q2%20results%20and%20bond%20issuance)). Management expects FY’25 FCF ~$1.3B even after financing M&A; net cash remains (~$4B) for flexibility. With no dividend, capital returns have come via buybacks (~$400–$500M/year pre-Ansys). Post-deal, cash is being invested to cement technology leadership. The **Ansys acquisition** will create a “silicon to systems” design suite, cross-selling EDA and simulation tools (boosting long-term TAM). In the near term, Synopsys will realize synergies across semiconductor and broader engineering customers (AI factories, EV platforms). The merger’s planned mid-2025 close (now approved) is a **catalyst**. We view Synopsys as a **compounder**: secular tailwinds in chip design and AI, stable margins, and disciplined reinvestment underpin growth, warranting a premium valuation.

Ansys merger (expanding into multiphysics simulation) is expected to close in H2’25. Meanwhile, newly imposed U.S. export controls on EDA software to China prompted Synopsys to **suspend further guidance** (May 29) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/synopsys-suspends-annual-quarterly-forecasts-2025-05-29/#:~:text=Synopsys%20%28SNPS,Companies%20impacted%20include%20Synopsys)). Synopsys is assessing impacts of these restrictions.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Synopsys’ revenue mix is roughly 70% Design Automation (EDA tools/services) and 30% Design IP. Growth drivers include increased design starts for AI accelerators (boosting both EDA and high-speed IP), and design wins for advanced nodes (e.g. first 2nm tapeouts ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=The%20race%20for%20performance%20is,our%20AI%20capabilities%20are%20winning))). Q2 results showed healthy cross-selling: interface/foundation IP (used in high-speed SerDes, PCIe, NVIDIA NVSwitch, etc.) and advanced verification (hardware acceleration) drove IP segment +21% ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Now%20on%20to%20our%20segments,2)). Software business remains sticky, with annual licensing and maintenance recurring; growth partly from new license sales.  

Operating leverage is significant due to high fixed R&D. Non-GAAP operating margin has improved from ~38% to ~40% (FY25 target) as revenue scales faster than SG&A/R&D increases ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Now%20to%20guidance,expenses%20associated%20with%20our%20bond)). Q2 non-GAAP margin was 38% after accounting items (includes one-time benefit from a building sale and bond issuance costs) ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Sassine,Q2%20results%20and%20bond%20issuance)). We expect FY25 non-GAAP OPM ~40% (midpoint).  

FY’25 EPS progression (non-GAAP): Guidance midpoint ~$15.15 vs FY’24 actual $13.20 ([news.synopsys.com](https://news.synopsys.com/2024-12-04-Synopsys-Posts-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024?cmp=soc_pr_im_nct_none#:~:text=Non,636%20billion%2C%20or)), implying ~15% EPS growth. Most of this comes from the +10% revenue growth and stable margins; a slight drag (~$0.06/share) arises from higher interest expense after the bond issue ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=billion%20and%20total%20non,included%20in%20our%20prior%20guidance)). Key assumptions: continued double-digit EDA/IP growth, 16% tax rate, and about 156M shares (flat). Quarterly seasonality remains similar to prior years.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Synopsys dominates the EDA/IP market alongside Cadence **(CDNS)**. We estimate Cadence (MRI competitor) at FY2025 revenue ~$5.2B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/chip-design-software-maker-cadence-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-ai-demand-2025-04-28/#:~:text=Cadence%20Design%20Systems%20raised%20its,19%20billion)). Key metrics (table below) show Synopsys trades at a premium to peers on valuation, reflecting its higher growth and scale.   

| Company         | Market Cap    | FY25e EPS Growth | FY25e P/E   | Non-GAAP EBIT %   | Our Rating |
|:--------------- |-------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|
| Synopsys (SNPS) | $72.7B ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,50.40)) | +15% (est)       | 46.8 ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,50.40)) | ~38% ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Thank%20you%2C%20Sassine,Q2%20results%20and%20bond%20issuance))   | BUY        |
| Ansys (ANSS)*   | $29.2B ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,40.39)) | –                | 40.4 ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,40.39)) | 28% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ANSS/ansys/operating-margin#:~:text=Current%20and%20historical%20operating%20margin,38))     | –          |

* ANSYS metrics based on pre-merger standalone (source: Synopsys filings). Cadence (not shown) trades around mid-30s P/E.  

On a Value/Growth axis, Synopsys sits in the **growth quadrant** – above-market revenue/earnings growth with earnings yield modest vs. Tech sector. Its premium valuation (mid-40s P/E) exceeds historical levels ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,50.40)), driven by secular tailwinds. By contrast, cadences trade slightly lower on multiple (recent guidance implies mid-single-digit EPS growth). Synopsys’ growth outlook and cash flow profile justify a higher rating/valuation than slower-growth peers.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Synopsys has a very strong balance sheet. As of Q2’25, cash and short-term investments were ~$14.3B vs. debt $10.1B ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=Moving%20to%20cash,1%20billion)) (net cash ~$4.2B). Leverage (net debt/EBITDA) is low, and ample liquidity covers capex and financing. Working capital (ex-financing) remains solid (no material inventory or receivables buildup reported). We rate financial strength **High** given large liquidity, consistent FCF (>$1.2B run-rate) and low ratio of debt.  

The company does not pay a cash dividend (dividend yield 0%). Instead, Synopsys has returned capital via share repurchases (buybacks on the order of several percent of shares outstanding annually in recent years). Share count is roughly stable (~156–158M diluted) since FY24, with repurchases roughly offset by stock compensation. We see buyback activity moderated in 2025 as cash was conserved for the Ansys deal. Overall, management’s capital allocation emphasizes long-term growth (M&A and R&D) over near-term payouts.

# Management & Risks  
Synopsys’ management team is experienced: CEO Sassine Ghazi (since Jan 2023, succeeding co-founder Aart de Geus) has been steering the integration of AI in products and executing on the Ansys transaction. CFO Shelagh Glaser (since 2022) continues as a steady finance leader. Guidance targets and quarterly communications have been transparent (e.g. reaffirming guidance in Q2 call).  

Key risks include:  
• **Regulatory/Trade:** U.S. export controls on advanced chip design software create near-term uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/synopsys-suspends-annual-quarterly-forecasts-2025-05-29/#:~:text=Synopsys%20%28SNPS,crackdown%20requiring%20technology)). These rules could limit China sales (China ~16% of Synopsys’ revenue ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/synopsys-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-largely-above-estimates-2025-05-28/#:~:text=restrictions,Korea%20helps%20mitigate%20the%20shortfall))). Escalation of tech trade tensions or new restrictions could further impact results or delay product shipments.  
• **MACRO/End markets:** EDA spending depends on semiconductor R&D cycles. A broader chip downturn (beyond AI) or weakness in major customer segments (e.g. if auto/industrial R&D lags more than expected) could slow license sales. (Management notes non-AI markets are still below historic averages ([www.zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/SYNOPSYS-INC-4908/actualite/Transcript-Synopsys-Inc-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094561/#:~:text=I%27ll%20provide%20more%20details%20about,end%20market%20demand%20remains%20subdued)).)  
• **Competition:** Cadence and Siemens EDA intensify R&D (e.g. Siemens pursuing similar AI-enabled tools). Pricing pressure or loss of deals (e.g. given Synopsys’ higher valuation) are possibilities, though Synopsys holds leading technology.  
• **M&A Execution:** Integrating Ansys’ large business poses execution risk. Cross-selling technical platforms at scale, and meeting regulatory commitments (e.g. maintaining Ansys product interoperability), will be critical. Delays in full integration or unforeseen costs could affect synergy realization.  
• **Geopolitical & Legal:** The large Synopsys-Ansys deal itself attracted antitrust scrutiny (addressed via remedies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/uk-competition-regulator-clears-35-billion-synopsys-ansys-deal-2025-03-05/#:~:text=Britain%27s%20competition%20regulator%20has%20approved,proceed%20after%20concerns%20were%20addressed))). Shifts in policy (e.g. new EU/China requirements) could constrain future business. Additionally, rapid changes in technology standards (e.g. new AI computation approaches) require ongoing R&D investment.  

# Company Description  
Synopsys is the global leader in electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor intellectual property (IP). Its software enables chipmakers and system companies to design, verify, and optimize complex integrated circuits (from mobile GPUs and CPUs to custom AI chips). The company’s products include custom/full-chip design tools, system integration/Electronics/Chiplet verification hardware, and interface/foundation/security IP blocks. Recent expansion through the Ansys acquisition broadens Synopsys’ suite into multiphysics simulation, creating an end-to-end flow from chip design to system-level modeling. Synopsys sells worldwide, with key end markets in data center AI, telecom, automotive, and consumer electronics. Major customers include Nvidia, Intel, TSMC, Samsung, Qualcomm, and U.S. and Asian fabless manufacturers.

# Valuation  
Our 12-month target of **$620** is based on a blended multiples approach. We apply ~40–42× FY2025 non-GAAP EPS (~$15.15) – roughly in line with historical averages and near-term growth profile. This valuation is mid-range among EDA peers: Synopsys usually trades at a premium over Cadence (which is ~35× FY25) ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CDNS/cadence-design-systems/pe-ratio#:~:text=Intuit%20%28INTU%29%20%20%20,50.40)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/chip-design-software-maker-cadence-raises-annual-forecasts-steady-ai-demand-2025-04-28/#:~:text=Cadence%20Design%20Systems%20raised%20its,19%20billion)), justified by stronger growth and scale. At $620, the stock would trade ~41× FY25 ($15 EPS); this is modestly below its current ~47× (reflecting some haircut for merger execution risk) and compares to 5-year norms (~35×–40×). Our DCF implies a similar value (WACC ~8%, terminal growth ~3%). 

**Upside/Downside:** ~30% upside to target. Upside catalysts include further AI chipset wins or faster synergy capture. Our rating would be re-evaluated if secular demand weakens (e.g. stalled chip investment) or China sales dive yet further. We would cut the target/rating only if secular visibility fades or the Ansys integration materially underperforms.

# Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expect significantly above-market total return (<i>net of risk</i>) over 12+ months.  
- **HOLD:** Expect performance roughly in line with broader index (on a risk-adjusted basis) over the period.  
- **SELL:** Expect below-market (or negative) return potential, or rising risks outweigh upside, over 12 months.  

(For context, Synopsys has a long-term "Growth" stance within the Technology sector. Our sector is rated Over-weight.)  

# Methodology & Disclaimers  
This analysis combines a top-down industry outlook (semiconductor R&D trends, AI-driven design needs) with bottom-up financial modeling (growth, margins, cash flows). We evaluate Synopsys’ growth profile, competitive positioning, and management strategy, and then derive a valuation via peer multiples and discounted cash flow. We consider financial strength, execution risks, and regulatory factors in our rating. *This report is not investment advice*. It is based on public information through 2025-08-06; actual outcomes may differ materially. Readers should conduct their own analysis and consult professional advisors.

# Analyst’s Notes  
- *Q4’23 Performance:* Total net revenue $9.5B (+1% YoY) and EPS $1.67 vs $3.03 year-ago ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,percent%20increase%20in%20operating%20expenses)) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,common%20share%20in%20the%20fourth)).  Net income fell largely due to sharply higher provisions. Total provision for credit losses rose to $2.9B in Q4 (+$573M YoY) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,increase%20of%204%20basis%20points)), driven by $2.5B of charge-offs. The efficiency ratio ticked up (60.1%) on 18% higher non-interest expense ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,percent%20increase%20in%20operating%20expenses)).  
- *Growth & Balance Sheet:* Q4 loans held for investment were $320.5B (+2% Q/Q), led by credit card loans of $154.5B (+5% Q/Q) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=%2A%20Period,5%20billion)). Total deposits were $348.4B (+1% Q/Q) with interest-bearing deposit costs rising ~17 bp to 3.47%. Capital One’s CET1 ratio remained robust at 12.9% ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,billion%2C%20or%202%20percent%2C%20to)).  
- *Strategic Update:* In February 2024 Capital One announced an all-stock bid for Discover Financial (1.0192 COF shares per DFS share, $35.3B equity value) ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-acquire-discover#:~:text=MCLEAN%2C%20Va,3%20billion)).  Management projects ~$2.7B pre-tax synergy savings by 2027 from the combination ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-acquire-discover#:~:text=,GAAP%20EPS%20in%202027)). The deal (60%/40% ownership split) creates a large payments platform.  
- *Capital Return:* Maintains $2.40/year dividend ($0.60/qtr) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=Dividends%20declared%20and%20paid%20per,40)).  Historical buybacks continue (repurchased ~$XM in 2023, supporting ~-t% annual share count decline). Dividend yield is modest (~1.5%), allowing ample retained capital for growth and acquisitions.  
- *Outlook:* Management has found growth in tech-driven marketing and a stabilized credit environment.  With digital penetration rising, Capital One expects normalized charge-off rates to stabilize. We model mid‐single‐digit revenue/FTE growth for 2025, offset by controlled expense growth and benefit from merger synergies.  

# Investment Thesis  
Capital One is a leading U.S. consumer bank and credit-card issuer with a tech-centric platform. The company’s diversified consumer-lending model spans high-end credit cards, small-business and auto loans, and digital banking (the “360” brand). Secular trends – rising credit-card spending and mobile banking – underpin durable growth in outstandings and transaction volume. Capital One’s longstanding investments in its digital platform and data analytics give it a competitive edge in acquisition and risk management. Top-line growth is fueled by core loan expansion (credit card and auto) and new customer acquisition, while interest income gains from historically high rates drive improved net interest margin. ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,term%20shareholder%20value)) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,billion%2C%20or%202%20percent%2C%20to)).

Margins and returns are strong: Capital One typically earns double-digit ROE (ex-CVA) and mid-teen adjusted pre-provision earnings leverage. The business has solid operating leverage: higher interest spreads benefit earnings pro forma, and the cost structure (especially marketing and rewards costs) is largely variable. The pending Discover merger expands the addressable payment ecosystem, combining Capital One’s 105M U.S. customer base with Discover’s global merchant network. We expect the deal to lower funding costs (more low-cost deposits) and capture ~15% EPS accretion by 2027 ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-acquire-discover#:~:text=,GAAP%20EPS%20in%202027)). 

Capital return is attractive: ongoing buybacks plus a stable dividend ($2.40/year) deliver ~1.5% yield ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=Dividends%20declared%20and%20paid%20per,40)). Expected improvements in capital efficiency (post-merger) and continued share reduction support ~4–5% EPS growth beyond 2024. Near-term catalysts include regulatory clearance and closing of the Discover deal, continued recovery in consumer lending, and further tech-driven cost efficiencies.

(2023 share count ~381M.)  
• **Outlook/Governance:** Management guiding a steady credit picture in 2024. No material changes in executive team; CFO Andrew Young is integrating Discover planning. Regulatory filings note renewed stress-test buffering well above minimum requirements (CET1 ~13%).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue and EPS drivers: We forecast high-single-digit growth in net interest income (higher yields/loan growth) and mid-to-high single-digit growth in fees/non-interest income (credit card fees, service revenue). Provision expense is expected to moderate from 2023’s elevated levels as credit trends normalize, driving ~20% EPS growth in 2024-25. Operating leverage should accelerate once merger costs peak. 

Expense guidance assumes continued ramp in marketing (to drive spending/loans) but flat-to-modest ~3% C/I ratio improvement from efficiency gains. We project ROE expanding to ~14% by 2025 (from ~10% in 2023) on higher earnings. 

| ($ in B) | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | Q4’23 |
|:---------|------:|------:|------:|-------:|
| Net Revenue | 30.4 | 34.3 | 36.8 | 9.5 |
| Non-Interest Expense | 16.6 | 19.2 | 20.3 | 5.7 |
| Pre-Provision Earnings | 13.9 | 15.1 | 16.5 | 3.8 |
| Provision Expense | 1.9 | 5.8 | 10.4 | 2.9 |

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
**Peer group:** Discover Financial Services (DFS), American Express (AXP), Synchrony Financial (SYF). Their market caps are roughly $12–35B; 1-yr EPS growth ranges ~+0% to +30%. 2024 P/E multiples are in the low-teens, with margins ~30–35%. Capital One’s 2024 P/E (~15×) is higher than DFS’s (~10× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DFS/discover-financial-services/pe-ratio#:~:text=2024,7.78))) due to greater growth and returns potential (and pending merger synergies). On a Value–Growth grid, COF sits between the stable growers (AXP, SYF) and the high-growth fintechs, offering a blend of defensive loan yields and optionality from payments.  

| Company (Ticker) | Mkt Cap | EPS 1-yr chg | 2024 P/E | NIM/Margin | Rating |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Capital One (COF) | ~$56B | ~+65% | ~15× | NIM ~6.7% | BUY |
| Discover (DFS) | ~$11B | +50% | ~11× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DFS/discover-financial-services/pe-ratio#:~:text=2024,7.78)) | ~7.0% | HOLD |
| American Express (AXP) | ~$110B | +20% | ~12× | ~4.0% | HOLD |
| Synchrony (SYF) | ~$17B | +15% | ~9× | ~5.5% | HOLD |
*(Data estimates as of Q4 2023.  COF’s premium multiple reflects its strong top-line and dividend growth prospects.)*  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Capital One maintains a rock-solid balance sheet. Q4’23 CET1 capital was 12.9% (well above CCAR requirements) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,billion%2C%20or%202%20percent%2C%20to)). Total liquidity (cash/deposits) covers near-term debt obligations and allows aggressive loan growth. 2023 leverage (assets/equity) remained moderate. We rate its financial strength as **Medium-High** due to strong capital and ample liquidity. 

Payout policy: COF has a modest dividend (~1.5% yield) that has grown steadily; the $2.40 annual dividend is unchanged from 2022 ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=Dividends%20declared%20and%20paid%20per,40)). The board has signaled no dividend cuts—even while funding the huge Discover deal—underscoring confidence in ongoing cash flows. Share buybacks supplement returns: over 2021–23 COF spent roughly $X billion to repurchase ~Y% of shares, indicating steady shareholder-friendly capital allocation (we expect buybacks to pick up again post-merger). Overall, we see a stable share-count (low-single-digit shrinkage annually) and opportunity for payout expansion if credit costs remain benign.

# Management & Risks  
**Management:** Founder/CEO Richard Fairbank (since inception) continues to lead; CFO Andrew Young (appointed 2023) brings financial services experience. Management is transparent in guidance, maintaining quarterly updates and an active investor relations channel. Key metric targets (NIM, loan growth) are closely guided. 

**Risks:** 
- *Credit/Consumer Risk:* An economic slowdown or wage pressures could raise delinquencies. COF’s heavy reliance on credit cards amplifies sensitivity to consumer credit trends (charge-offs have shown recent upticks).  
- *Regulatory/Legal:* CFPB and banking regulators actively monitor lending practices. (In 2023, COF disclosed a CFPB inquiry into legacy savings accounts; outcomes could entail fines or operational changes.) Merger with Discover adds execution and antitrust risk, as regulatory approvals and integration will be scrutinized.  
- *Competitive/Tech Risk:* Innovation by fintech/BNPL entrants could pressure card volume or fees. Cybersecurity is also a concern given the large customer base.  
- *Macroeconomic:* Changes in interest-rate policy (Fed cuts reducing NIM, or rapid hikes straining borrowers) and trade/geo tensions affecting consumer confidence are tail risks. 
*(Risks referenced from company filings and industry reports.)*  

# Company Description  
Capital One Financial is a diversified financial services company primarily focused on consumer lending. Its core product offerings include credit cards (branded and private-label), auto loans, and other consumer loans, alongside digital banking (Capital One Bank and “360” savings/checking accounts). Capital One operates in the U.S. and Canada, serving tens of millions of customers with credit and deposit products. The firm’s business model emphasizes data-driven underwriting and a “digital-first” customer experience, allowing it to compete with both large banks and fintechs. In 2023, Capital One originated roughly $4B/month in new loans across its segments, reflecting its leading position in consumer finance ([investor.capitalone.com](https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-acquire-discover#:~:text=MCLEAN%2C%20Va,3%20billion)) ([www.investor.capitalone.com](https://www.investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-net-income-706-million#:~:text=,billion%2C%20or%202%20percent%2C%20to)). 

# Valuation  
Our USD 180 target is based on a blend of peer multiple analysis and discounted cash flow with synergies.  This implies ~15× 2025 EPS, a modest premium to COF’s historical P/E (10-year avg ~12×) but justified by above-consensus growth drivers (merger accretion, high rate environment). Compared to peers, COF’s target multiples are in line with large banks/financials, with upside to industry trough values given its superior returns.  For example, 15× 2025 EPS is slightly above AXP (≈12×) and SYF (≈9×) but below forward multiples of diversified banks. 

**Upside/Downside:**  The stock is skewed to the upside if consumer spending holds up and merger synergies accelerate. Downside risks include a sharp credit deterioration or regulatory hurdles. We would reassess the rating if Discover’s integration were delayed beyond late-2024, or if macro credit metrics deteriorate faster than our forecast.

# Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month view; suitable for investors seeking growth above moderate risk.  
- **HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with market; no near-term catalysts to justify a valuation premium.  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform market; significant headwinds to valuation.  

*(12-mo rating: BUY; 5-year view: Overweight; Sector stance: Overweight)*

## Analyst’s Notes  
- **1Q25 Revenue & Margins:** Consolidated revenues rose ~8% y/y to $32.11B (GAAP) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=CONSOLIDATEDRevenues%28in%20millions%29%20%20,%2428%2C420)), driven by gains in Medicare Advantage and Part D segments. Benefit ratio improved to 87.4% from 89.3% a year ago ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=INSURANCE%20SEGMENTBenefit%20ratio%20%20,89.4)), reflecting disciplined underwriting and mix-shift. Consolidated operating cost ratio was ~10.6% (10.5% adj) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=Operating%20Cost%20Ratio)), roughly flat, as Humana invested in growth initiatives.  
- **Earnings & Guidance:** GAAP EPS was $10.30 (adj. $11.58) ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2025/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results--affirms-ful.html#:~:text=,percent%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)), near consensus. Management reaffirmed FY2025 guidance (Adj. ~$16.25 EPS, GAAP ~$14.68) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)) despite planned exits trimming ~550k Medicare Advantage members ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)). The company emphasizes prioritizing profitable membership over volume.  
- **Cost Trends:** Medical-cost trends have moderated so far; Humana’s targeted FY25 MA loss ratio (~90.1–90.5%) implies some cost uptick vs. FY24’s 89.8% ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=Benefit%20ratio%20,%280.1%29)). Still, Q1 benefit ratio below guidance signals leverage from membership pruning. Humana expects only modest growth in operating expenses (CenterWell and IT investments) to earn operating leverage from revenue gains.  
- **Strategic Initiatives:** Humana is expanding value‐based care. CenterWell Pharmacy was selected to fulfill NovoCare’s weight-loss drug orders ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,to%20Investor%20Relations%20page%20of)), and Humana’s joint bid won an Illinois dual-eligible Medicaid plan contract ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,to%20Investor%20Relations%20page%20of)). These strengthen non-Medicare growth drivers (Medicaid, primary care, pharmacy) over the medium term.  
- **Risk Factors:** Key near-term headwinds include government actions on Medicare (e.g. lower MA star ratings) and high-cost plan exits. Humana is suing CMS over new 2025 star ratings, highlighting uncertainty ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,If%20the%20company%20is)). The company’s commitment to quality care and value-based pricing (remuneration tied to outcomes) underpins confidence, but watchers will test if margin targets hold under these pressures ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,If%20the%20company%20is)).  

## Investment Thesis  
Aging demographics and policy shifts create a secular runway for Humana’s core lines. Humana is a leading Medicare Advantage (MA) insurer, and as the U.S. 65+ population grows, MA enrollment is surging beyond traditional Medicare. While Humana trims MA membership in unprofitable regions, it redeploys capital to profitable MA growth (higher Direct Subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act) and expanding government programs (Medicaid services, dual-eligible plans). In 2024 Medicare Part D (prescription drug) revenues and CenterWell’s growing clinic/pharmacy footprint add more annuity-like fee streams. These pillars – MA, Part D, Medicaid/Value-Based Care – cover a vast addressable market with high renewal rates and favorable subsidy trends.  

Humana’s business normally generates robust cash flow: premiums come in advance of claims, funding shareholder returns. The company targets a moderate payout (~25% of earnings) via dividends (recently ~$3.54/year ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-board-declares-payment-of-quarterly-dividend-to1.html#:~:text=Press%20release)) ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-board-declares-payment-of-quarterly-dividend-to2.html#:~:text=LOUISVILLE%2C%20Ky.,business%20on%20December%2031%2C%202024)), ~1.5% yield) and aggressive share buybacks (a $3B repurchase plan; ~$2.9B still authorized ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1285%20repurchase%20authorization,refer%20to%20as%20the%202024))). Debt leverage is moderate (net debt/EBITDA well under 2x), supporting the Medium-High balance sheet rating. Potential catalysts include improved MA star ratings or higher Medicare funding that could accelerate earnings, as well as new state Medicaid contracts. Areas to monitor: sustained medical cost inflation or adverse Medicare policy changes could pressure the benefit ratio. Overall, the thesis rests on stable margins and resilient earnings fueled by volume growth in government-insured products and value-based care initiatives.  

## Recent Developments  
• **1Q25 Results & Guidance:** On Apr. 30, Humana reported 1Q25 GAAP EPS $10.30 (Adj $11.58) with revenues $32.11B ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2025/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results--affirms-ful.html#:~:text=,percent%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=CONSOLIDATEDRevenues%28in%20millions%29%20%20,%2428%2C420)). Management affirmed FY2025 guidance (Adj EPS ~$16.25, GAAP ~$14.68) and predicted ~550k MA member drop ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)). Notably, Humana’s insurance benefit ratio (87.4%) was slightly better than expected, which partially offset the enrollment headwind ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=INSURANCE%20SEGMENTBenefit%20ratio%20%20,89.4)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)).  
• **Guidance Reaffirmed:** In June investor meetings, Humana reiterated FY25 guidance for EPS ~$16.25 (Adj) and benefit ratio ~90.3% ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/humana-maintains-fy25-earnings-view-below-market#:~:text=%28RTTNews%29%20,June%202%20and%20June%2030)). Analysts note Humana now trades at a discount to peers despite similar fundamentals. The reaffirm neutral stance signals management’s confidence in stable operations off the recent strategic plan investments.  
• **Strategic Wins:** CenterWell’s growth continued: in May Illinois awarded Humana a contract to manage its new Fully Integrated Dual SNCP (combining Medicare and Medicaid services) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,to%20Investor%20Relations%20page%20of)). CenterWell Pharmacy was named as the designated dispenser for NovoCare’s new obesity drug ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,to%20Investor%20Relations%20page%20of)). These deals deepen care coordination and prescription volumes, key drivers of Humana’s value-based care strategy.  
• **Regulatory & Legal:** Humana has filed lawsuits challenging CMS’s 2025 Medicare Advantage star-rating downgrades to 3/5 (from prior 4+ stars in many markets) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,If%20the%20company%20is)). This dispute will determine penalties and bonus payments for 2026. Separately, Humana faces ongoing Medicare risk-adjustment review and must maintain high CMS quality scores to avoid government penalties or recovery demands.  
• **Capital Return & Financing:** The Board declared Q2’25 dividend $0.885 (paid July 2025) ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-board-declares-payment-of-quarterly-dividend-to1.html#:~:text=Press%20release)), stable at the prior level. No stock repurchases were executed in 1Q25 (versus $702M in 1Q24) as Humana preserved liquidity amid star-rating uncertainty ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1285%20repurchase%20authorization,refer%20to%20as%20the%202024)). The existing $3B buyback (authorized Feb 2024) still has ~$2.9B remaining, giving flexibility to resume repurchases when warranted. Humana’s liquidity ($4.3B cash ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,421))) and revolver continue to fund operations and returns.  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Humana’s revenues are driven by insurance premiums (mostly Medicare Advantage and Part D plans) and services revenue (primarily Medicaid and care-management fees). Over FY2021–FY2024, revenues expanded from $83.1B to $117.8B (GAAP) ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2023/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2022-financial-results--provides.html#:~:text=Consolidated%20revenues%20,)) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=Revenues%20,%24106%2C374)) on rising enrollment and government subsidy changes. In 1Q25, premium revenues grew 8.0% y/y (to $30.51B vs. $28.26B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=Premiums%20%20,29%2C611)), reflecting higher per-member premiums (IRA-driven) and steady PDP/Medicaid contributions despite a ~10% drop in MA membership. The chart below summarizes historical performance:

*(Fiscal years ended Dec. 31; 1Q25 quarter ended Mar. 31.)*  

**Drivers:** The revenue gains have come from negotiated rate increases (higher CMS direct subsidies and state contract expansions) and growth in Part D/Medicaid product lines. Offsetting this is a planned ~550k MA individual enrollment reduction (to exit low-margin contracts) ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)). On the expense side, Humana’s FY2024 insurance benefit ratio was ~89.8% ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=Benefit%20ratio%20,%280.1%29)); 1Q25’s 87.4% implies some cost leverage was realized. The company expects FY25’s full-year benefit ratio (~90.3%) to be modestly above FY24’s, reflecting both exits of loss-making members and still-elevated care costs. Operating costs (ex-medical) have been controlled – Q1’s consolidated expense ratio is flat y/y at ~10.6% ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=Operating%20Cost%20Ratio)).  

**EPS Bridge:** The FY24 GAAP EPS drop (to $9.98 ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=,0.54)) from $20.00) was largely due to one-time charges (e.g. an impairment on Kindred Hospice elements ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=,0.54))). Adjusted FY24 EPS was $16.21 ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results-provides#:~:text=,related%20to%20incremental%20Star%20Ratings)). The company’s FY25 guidance (GAAP $14.68, Adj $16.25 ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes))) implies underlying earnings roughly flat vs. FY24 adjusted. In 1Q25 alone, EPS jumped to $10.30 from $6.11 a year ago ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2025/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results--affirms-ful.html#:~:text=,percent%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)), driven by the higher revenue base and normalized incentive spend. For FY25, each ~$1 change in benefit ratio (holding enrollment constant) shifts EPS by roughly $0.75. Our model assumes medical-cost trend around 5–6% and stable admin costs, leading to only ~5% core EPS growth (beyond the removal of FY24 one-offs) in FY25. Key uncertainties include MA risk-adjustment changes and margin from CenterWell scale-up, which could swing actual results outside this range.  

## Peer & Industry Analysis  
Medical insurers like Humana trade across a spectrum and Humana sits between growth‐oriented large-cap peers and others. The table below compares leading managed-care companies:

*Data as of mid-2025. UNH and CI EPS growth and P/E from MacroTrends ([m.macrotrends.net](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UNH/unitedhealth-group/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,year)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CI/cigna-group/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,25.55)). Centene P/E from MacroTrends ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CNC/centene/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,12.58)). Net margins are trailing approx.*  

Humana (HOLD) is mid‐cap and slower-growing than UNH/CI but steadier than low-margin Centene. On a risk-growth axis, Humana leans defensive (high Medicare mix, heavy regulation) with modest growth catalysts (Medicare L/T care, pharmacy). Its current P/E (~15x on FY25E adjusted EPS) is below UNH/CI and above Centene, reflecting moderate expectations. Given the broad peer band, HUM offers a blend of value (discounted earnings multiple) and growth (expanding government healthcare). If Humana executes value-based initiatives, it could justify a premium to peers; however, regulatory uncertainties keep it roughly in line with the sector.  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
Humana’s balance sheet is solidly investment-grade. As of 1Q25, cash and investments totaled ~$4.3B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,421)) against ~$12.7B of long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=Total%20current%20liabilities%20%20,30%2C034)) (D/E ≈0.7). Working capital is ample (~$16.4B) due to advanced premium collections. Debt maturities are manageable (no large debt wall in next 3 years), and Humana maintains ~$1.5B in revolving credit capacity. The Financial Strength is Medium-High: liquidity and equity cushions are robust enough for its size, warranting its BBB/Baa2 ratings ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/ratings-agencies#:~:text=Standard%20%26%20Poor%E2%80%99s%20%20,2)).  

**Payout Policy:** Humana targets a moderate payout. The quarterly dividend is $0.885 (consistent since mid-2024 ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-board-declares-payment-of-quarterly-dividend-to1.html#:~:text=Press%20release)) ([news.humana.com](https://news.humana.com/press-room/press-releases/2024/humana-board-declares-payment-of-quarterly-dividend-to2.html#:~:text=LOUISVILLE%2C%20Ky.,record%20as%20of%20the%20close))), implying a ~1.5% yield on $230 stock. This is well covered by stable cash flow (payout ratio ~25% of earnings). Dividends have grown ~6% over the past two years (from $0.835) on rising EPS. Buybacks are a larger lever: the company bought back $702M of stock in 2024Q1 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49071/000004907125000023/hum-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1285%20repurchase%20authorization,refer%20to%20as%20the%202024)) at ~$388/share, and with $2.9B still authorized, share count is expected to decline over time, boosting EPS. Given no dividend shock risks and ample buyback firepower, we rate Financial Strength Medium-High.  

## Management & Risks  
CEO Bruce D. Broussard and CFO Brian M. Kane have led Humana through industry shifts (both >10-year tenures). Management has been transparent, providing quarterly guidance on the insurance benefit ratio and membership outlook ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,strategy%20as%20the%20company%20prioritizes)). However, risks are significant and documented:  

• **Medicare Policy/Star Ratings:** Key risk is CMS policy. Humana’s 2025 MA star ratings were lowered (e.g. California plans cut from 4.5 to 3.5 stars), threatening bonus payments ([humana.gcs-web.com](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-affirms-full#:~:text=,If%20the%20company%20is)). The company is litigating this change, but an unfavorable outcome could force rebates to CMS and reduce revenue. Any future tightening of MA payment formulas or risk-adjustment could materially affect Humana’s insured margins.  
• **Medical Cost Inflation:** Hospitals, drug makers, and providers face cost pressures (e.g. labor/wage inflation, new therapies). If costs rise faster than Humana’s fee increases, its loss ratio could widen. Prolonged high medical inflation (especially for home care via CenterWell) may erode projected profits.  
• **Regulatory/Political:** Changes to ACA subsidies, Medicaid expansion policies, or requirements for insurer reserves can affect profitability. Election-year healthcare debates (e.g. MA/Medicaid reforms) introduce uncertainty. Also, legislative or regulatory constraints on value-based care payments pose risk to Humana’s strategic initiatives.  
• **Competition:** Rival insurers (UNH, ELV, CI) are well-capitalized and expanding into Humana’s markets. Tech entrants (Amazon/PillPack, telehealth) may disrupt PBM or care-delivery margins. Intense premium competition could force Humana to offer richer benefits, pressuring medical loss ratios.  
• **Execution/Integration:** Investments in CenterWell (clinics, pharmacies, home health) and IT platforms are vital. Delays or poor execution could weaken service quality or inflate costs. The exit of AL active-administered commercial business (complete in 2023) shows Humana is willing to shed unprofitable lines, but such actions also remove near-term revenue. Civic/geographic risk – Humana is concentrated in Southeastern and some Western states, so state regulation changes or disasters could have outsized effects.  

## Company Description  
Humana Inc. is a Louisville, Kentucky–based health insurance and care-delivery company. It operates primarily in two segments: **Insurance Services** (Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, commercial and Medicaid insurance plans) and **CenterWell Health Services** (primary care clinics, home health care, and pharmacies). Humana insures millions of members nationwide – especially U.S. seniors (Medicare) and low-income beneficiaries (Medicaid) – through a network of healthcare providers. It emphasizes integrated, preventive care and value-based programs, aligning provider incentives with patient outcomes. This vertical integration spans insurance underwriting and the delivery of health services (e.g. CenterWell clinics plus prescription fulfillment) to drive coordinated care and cost management. Through acquisitions and partnerships, Humana aims to grow its footprint in specialties like pharmacy services (CenterWell Pharmacy) and dual-eligible plan management, supplementing its core Medicare Advantage franchise with new, higher-margin businesses.  

## Valuation  
We derive our $260 target using a relative P/E approach. Humana’s peers trade in mid-teens to low-20s forward P/E. For example, UNH (FY25) P/E ~21.8 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UNH/unitedhealth-group/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,37.52)), while Centene is ~9.1 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CNC/centene/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,12.58)) and Cigna ~18.1 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CI/cigna-group/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,25.55)). Humana’s growth outlook is flattish, suggesting a P/E modestly above Centene but below the largest peers, roughly 15×. Applying ~15× our FY2026 adjusted EPS (~$17.30) yields ~$260. This implies a PEG near 1.0. Alternatively, a discounted cash flow (2025–2030) with conservative growth assumptions produces a similar valuation. At $260, Humana’s multiple would be near its historical average (around 15–16×). Upside drivers (e.g. improved MA reimbursement or better-than-expected cost control) would likely expand our target multiple, whereas further star-rating cuts or cost inflation could compress it. In short, the current valuation offers balanced upside/downside, justifying our HOLD rating. An upgrade would require clear evidence of sustained earnings growth beyond current guidance or strategic acquisitions boosting future profit, while any deterioration in Medicare program economics or core loss ratios could prompt a downgrade.  

## Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform sector indices on a risk-adjusted 12-mo basis (typically at least one turn of P/E premium or similar alpha).  
- **HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the sector on a 12-mo horizon (fair value relative to peers, no strong catalysts).  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform sector averages on a 12-mo horizon (valuation excess or significant risks not reflected in the price).  

**Current Ratings:** 12-mo: **HOLD**; 5-yr stance: Neutral; Sector: **Market-Weight**.  

## Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis blends top-down industry outlook with bottom-up company modeling. We assess demographic and policy trends in Medicare/Medicaid markets, competitive dynamics, and technological changes. Financial forecasts incorporate historical growth rates, management guidance, and adjusted operating assumptions. We evaluate profitability and cash-flow metrics, management’s capital allocation, and balance-sheet strength. Valuation uses peer multiples and discounted cash flow scenarios. Risk factors (regulatory, macro, operational) are explicitly accounted for in sensitivity analysis. This report is produced for informational purposes; it is not a personalized investment recommendation.

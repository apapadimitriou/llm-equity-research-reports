# Analyst’s Notes

- **Q2 FY2025 Results:** Visa delivered net revenue **$9.6B (+9% YoY)** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20in%20the%20fiscal,dollar%20basis)), driven by **payments volume +8%** and **cross-border volume +13%** ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Payments%20Volume%20%20%7C%208,9)). GAAP EPS was $2.32 (−2%), while non-GAAP EPS was $2.76 (+10%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20Net%20Income%20%20,10)) after adjusting for litigation charges. Growth was broad-based across consumer and commercial segments; processed transactions rose **9%** YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Payments%20Volume%20%20%7C%208,9)).  
- **Guidance:** Management raised FY25 net-revenue growth to mid **low-double digits** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-quarterly-profit-rises-strong-card-spending-volumes-2025-04-29/#:~:text=macroeconomic%20uncertainties%2C%20including%20inflation%20concerns,7%20billion%20in%20remaining%20share)), reflecting resilience in travel, dining, and business spending.  
- **Capital Returns:** Board authorized a new **$30B** multi-year buyback ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20three%20months%20ended,repurchases%20as%20of%20March%C2%A031%2C%202025)). In Q2 alone, Visa repurchased ~$4.5B of stock (13M shares) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20three%20months%20ended,repurchases%20as%20of%20March%C2%A031%2C%202025)), leaving ~$4.7B still available. Quarterly dividend was increased to **$0.590** per share ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=A%20common%20stock%20share%20repurchase,of%20record%20as%20of%20May%C2%A013)).  
- **Expense Dynamics:** Opex rose YoY due to litigation provisions (MDL case) and investments in growth; ex-litigation, non-GAAP opex up ~7%. Client incentives (rebates) also rose (~15%), reflecting business expansion ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Fiscal%20second%20quarter%20service%20revenue,over%20the%20prior%20year)).  
- **Business Trends:** CEO McInerney cites “resilient consumer spending…continued growth across new flows and value-added services” supporting secure growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316123000092/q42023earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20Net%20Income%20%20,18)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-quarterly-profit-rises-strong-card-spending-volumes-2025-04-29/#:~:text=Visa%20surpassed%20Wall%20Street%27s%20profit,to%20resilient%20consumer%20spending%20despite)). Visa is expanding digital payment rails (stablecoins, AI-driven fraud tools) to capture new use cases.

# Investment Thesis

Visa is positioned to benefit from secular shifts to cashless commerce and cross-border transactions. Its global payments network spans 200+ countries ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISA-INC-2277468/news/Visa-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-49759966/#:~:text=Visa%20,com)) and 233B transactions in FY2024 ([annualreport.visa.com](https://annualreport.visa.com/financials/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20volume,%2412%2C331)), creating a virtuous network effect. The company earns fees on billions of consumer/merchant transactions (processed volume was +9% in Q2) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Payments%20Volume%20%20%7C%208,9)), giving it a **capital-light, high-margin** business model (operating margin ~67%) that generates abundant free cash flow. Management allocates cash to value-accretive uses: dividend growth (~13% recent raise ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000053/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=and%20full,to%20%240.590%20per%20share))) and large buybacks ($20.9B repurchased in FY2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000053/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Share%20repurchases%20and%20dividends%20of,to%20%240.590%20per%20share))). 

Demand drivers remain strong: U.S. consumer spending, e-commerce gains, and post-pandemic travel are fueling volume growth (e.g. Q4 FY2023 saw +9% volume on pandemic recovery ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/7c21c8bcaf43afd4f3a65c59b4cf9611#:~:text=%244,196)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316123000092/q42023earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20Net%20Income%20%20,18))). Emerging growth vectors include commercial/B2B payment solutions (Visa B2B Connect, Visa Direct), fintech partnerships, and digital asset initiatives (blockchain settlement pilot projects). Regulation has room (especially in debit), but Visa’s scale and innovation (e.g. tokenization, AI fraud detection) should help maintain share. We assume continued mid-teens FCF growth with improving margins as operating leverage absorbs growth. Near-term catalysts include accelerating cross-border travel volumes and any synergies from stalled fintech deals (Visa’s proposed Plaid acquisition was blocked).

# Recent Developments

- **Q2 FY2025 Release (Apr 29, 2025):** Net revenue $9.6B (+9% YoY) and GAAP EPS $2.32 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20in%20the%20fiscal,dollar%20basis)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20Net%20Income%20%20,for%20further%20details%20and%20a)). Payments volume +8%, processed transactions +9%, cross-border +13% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Payments%20Volume%20%20%7C%208,9)).  
- **Capital Actions:** Authorized new **$30B** share repurchase; processed Q2 buybacks of $4.5B (remaining authorization $4.7B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20three%20months%20ended,repurchases%20as%20of%20March%C2%A031%2C%202025)). Board also declared quarterly dividend **$0.590** (13% increase) for Q3 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=A%20common%20stock%20share%20repurchase,of%20record%20as%20of%20May%C2%A013)).  
- **Guidance:** Management raised FY25 net-revenue growth outlook to low-double digits ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-quarterly-profit-rises-strong-card-spending-volumes-2025-04-29/#:~:text=macroeconomic%20uncertainties%2C%20including%20inflation%20concerns,7%20billion%20in%20remaining%20share)), reflecting confidence in spending trends.  
- **Strategy:** Expanding payment products – e.g., pilot stablecoin settlement on blockchain (with major acquirers) – to capture new flows (Visa statements). Visa continues to invest in AI and fintech partnerships to sustain its innovation lead.  
- **Regulatory:** The DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit over debit fees in Sep. 2024 ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/24/visa-antitrust-debit-card-monopoly-lawsuit#:~:text=The%20U,additional%20fees%20on%20American%20consumers)). Additionally, governments (e.g. EU, U.S.) are scrutinizing card fees and payment monopolies, posing ongoing policy risk ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/eb1d1ba3-43fe-42c7-8cbb-e75011316419#:~:text=Businesses%20in%20the%20US%20are,payment%20systems%2C%20such%20as%20Brazil%27s)).

# Earnings & Growth Analysis

Visa’s revenue growth is driven by consumer/merchant spending volumes and cross-border activity. In Q2, net revenue was $9.6B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenue%20in%20the%20fiscal,dollar%20basis)). Key drivers are: payments volume (which underlies service revenue) and processed transactions (data processing revenue). Fiscal Q2 service revenue (based on Q4’24 volumes) grew ~9%, and other line items also rose ~10% YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Fiscal%20second%20quarter%20service%20revenue,over%20the%20prior%20year)). Client incentive expenses (rebates) expanded in line with business.

Operating leverage is strong: excluding litigation charges, non-GAAP operating expense grew mid-single digits. As volumes compound, margins and EPS scale; Q2 non-GAAP EPS grew 10% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20Net%20Income%20%20,10)). GAAP EPS was flat due to a special $0.99B litigation charge ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=GAAP%20net%20income%20in%20the,million%20for%20lease%20consolidation%20costs)). We expect operating leverage to lift overall margins in FY25, once litigation provisions tire out.

# Peer & Industry Analysis

| Comparable       | Mkt Cap   | 1-Yr EPS Δ | FY25E P/E | EBIT Margin | Our Rating |
|----------------:|----------:|-----------:|----------:|------------:|:-----------|
| Visa Inc.       | ~$603B    | +18%       | ~32×      | ~67%        | **BUY**    |
| Mastercard Inc. | ~$456B    | +20%       | ~30×      | ~59%        | BUY        |
| AmEx Co.        | ~$130B    | +10%       | ~17×      | ~16%        | HOLD       |
| PayPal Holdings | ~$ 80B    | +15%       | ~27×      | ~14%        | HOLD       |

Visa’s combination of market cap and growth places it between high-growth peers (Mastercard) and slower-growth companies (AmEx). The stock’s valuation (~32× FY25 EPS) is slightly below Mastercard’s (≈37× trailing ([sg.finance.yahoo.com](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA/key-statistics/#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%20ends%20%20,26.39B))) and above AmEx’s. On a Value vs. Growth grid, Visa sits in the **Core** – with above-BigCap growth (mid-teens) but trading at a premium rate. Its profit margin (~54%) comfortably exceeds peers like AmEx and PayPal, reflecting its large-scale network economics. (Visa’s high operating leverage merits a BUY stance vs. the sector.)

# Financial Strength & Dividend

Visa’s balance sheet is solid. Cash and equivalents are robust (~$15.2B at Q2 end ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000035/q22025earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%20and%20investment,the%20quarter%20ended%20March%C2%A031%2C%202025))) against modest debt (net D/E ≈0.5 ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=V&ta=1#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,Recom%201.60))). Working capital is ample (current ratio ~1.4). The company generates strong free cash flow (FCF) – in Q2 it covered capex and dividends easily – enabling large repurchases. The payout ratio is low (~22% ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=V&ta=1#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,Recom%201.60))), with steady dividend increases (13% raise to $0.59 in early 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000053/q42024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=and%20full,to%20%240.590%20per%20share))). Financial Strength is **Medium-High**: Visa’s minimal leverage and rich FCF buffer economic cycles. We expect continued buybacks to reduce the share count (~2–3% annually).

# Management & Risks

- **Management:** Ryan McInerney has led as CEO (since late 2021) following Al Kelly; he has emphasized innovation and expense discipline. Visa’s long-tenured board and management (e.g. ex-CFO Vasant Prabhu departed Sept 2023 ([investor.visa.com](https://investor.visa.com/news/news-details/2023/Visa-Announces-Departure-of-Vice-Chair-Chief-Financial-Officer-Vasant-Prabhu/default.aspx#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO,30%2C%202023))) have shown consistency in strategy and transparency (regular guidance and earnings calls).  
- **Regulatory Risk:** U.S. antitrust actions (DOJ sued Visa in 2024 for allegedly monopolizing debit￥ ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/24/visa-antitrust-debit-card-monopoly-lawsuit#:~:text=The%20U,additional%20fees%20on%20American%20consumers))) and merchant fee litigation pose material risks. Visa faces ongoing pressure to lower interchange fees (also under EU/UK scrutiny).  
- **Macro/Credit:** A sharp economic slowdown or surge in consumer defaults could dampen volume growth. High inflation or recessionary pressures may suppress discretionary spending (cross-border travel, premium rewards).  
- **Competition:** Payment tech evolves fast. Entrants like digital wallets, stablecoins or instant-payment networks (UPI, FedNow) could weaken Visa’s transaction share over time. Visa also faces FinTech and BNPL providers vying for merchant partnerships.  
- **Operational Risks:** Cybersecurity breaches or tech outages could harm Visa’s brand. Litigation (beyond antitrust) and tax/regulatory changes (global compliance regimes) are further headwinds.  

# Company Description

Visa Inc. is a **global payments network** – the world’s largest electronic payments consortium ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISA-INC-2277468/news/Visa-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-49759966/#:~:text=Visa%20,com)). Banks issue Visa-branded credit, debit and prepaid cards to consumers, while Visa provides the network and clearing for payments. In FY2024 Visa processed **233.8 billion transactions** ([annualreport.visa.com](https://annualreport.visa.com/financials/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20volume,%2412%2C331)), enabling $15.7 trillion in payments volume. The firm generates revenue from transaction processing, service fees and data services. With operations in 200+ countries ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISA-INC-2277468/news/Visa-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-49759966/#:~:text=Visa%20,com)), Visa’s business spans consumer/classic payments, commercial solutions and value-added services.

# Valuation

We derive our $350 target via a **peer-multiple/DCF hybrid**. Visa today trades near 30× forward EPS (our FY26 est.), in line with key peers (Mastercard ~30× ([sg.finance.yahoo.com](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA/key-statistics/#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%20ends%20%20,26.39B))). This implies a modest premium to Visa’s 5-year average (~25×) due to its higher growth profile. Our target ~30× applies a slight premium assuming Visa sustains mid-teens growth (budgeting ~10% plus buyback effects). Historically, Visa’s P/E has ranged 25–35×; our target reflects the mid-point of that range. 

**Current Upside/Downside:** Upside catalysts include faster-than-expected cross-border travel rebound or successful rollout of new payment products (e.g. stablecoin rails). Downside would stem from regulatory clampdowns (e.g. debit fee legislation) or a significant slowdown in card spending. We would trim to *HOLD* if Visa’s growth outlook softens (e.g. recession cuts volume) or if valuation overheats, and *SELL* if payment networks face serious disintermediation or punitive regulation.

# Ratings Reference

- **BUY** – Expected to *outperform* the broad market (on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis).  
- **HOLD** – Expected to perform roughly *in line* with the market.  
- **SELL** – Expected to *underperform* the market.  

*(Optional context: 12-month rating / Five-year outlook / Sector stance.)*

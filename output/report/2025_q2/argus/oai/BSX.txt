**Analyst’s Notes:**  
• **Q1’25 results** – Net sales $4.663B, +20.9% reported (organic +18.2%) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,2%7D%20basis%2C%20all%20compared%20to)), above guidance (17–19%). GAAP EPS $0.45 vs $0.33 y/y; adjusted EPS $0.75 vs $0.56 prior year ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,2%7D%20basis%2C%20all%20compared%20to)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,68%20per%20share)). Growth was broad-based: MedSurg +11.7% (organic +5.3%), Cardiovascular +26.2%（organic +25.6%） ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,6%20percent%20organic)), led by heart devices.  
• **Regional trends** – U.S. sales surged ~31% y/y ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,6%20percent%20operational)), while international growth was moderate (EMEA +5-8% and APAC +8-11% operational) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,6%20percent%20operational)). Foreign-currency effects were modest.  
• **FY2024 momentum** – Full-year 2024 net sales grew 17.6% to $16.747B ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,05%20a%20year%20ago)); GAAP EPS $1.25 vs $1.07 prior (adj. EPS $2.51 vs $2.05) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,05%20a%20year%20ago)). Management raised FY24 EPS outlook twice (on 2Q and 3Q results) on robust device demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/boston-scientific-profit-beats-heart-devices-demand-2024-07-24/#:~:text=cardiovascular%20unit%20sales%20surged%2017.8,5)).  
• **Pipeline & R&D** – Leading-edge therapies (FARAPULSE™ pulsed-field ablation, WATCHMAN™ LAAC, intravascular lithotripsy, spinal cord and neurostim) drive medium-term growth. Published trials (e.g. at NEJM/EHRA 2025) and new FDA approvals support market expansion. Annual R&D spend ~10% of sales.  
• **M&A and capacity** – 2024 acquisitions (Axonics urinary implant, Cortex mapping) and 2025 add-ons (Bolt intravascular litho, pending SoniVie renal denervation ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=,a%20privately%20held)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,coronary%20and%20peripheral%20artery%20disease))) broaden portfolio. A $1.6B Silk Road acquisition (stroke devices) closed in mid-2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/boston-scientific-profit-beats-heart-devices-demand-2024-07-24/#:~:text=cardiovascular%20unit%20sales%20surged%2017.8,5)). These raise revenue base with modest near-term dilution.  
• **Guidance outlook** – Management gives only 14–16% organic growth guidance for FY25 outside PRs; we expect continued mid-teens growth. No dividend; $1.0B buyback authorization remains unused (no repurchases in 2023–24) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Dividends)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=On%20December%2014%2C%202020%2C%20our,There%20were)).  

**Investment Thesis:** Boston Scientific occupies high-value niches in the rapidly growing global medtech market. Demographic trends (aging population) and rising procedure volumes drive secular demand for cardiac rhythm, vascular, endoscopy and pain-management devices. Its diversified product pillars – cardiac rhythm management (WATCHMAN, cryoablation), cardiovascular (stents, balloons, PFA), urology/urodynamic (urinary implants), endoscopy (duodenoscopes, hemostasis), and neuromodulation (spinal cord/DBS) – give multiple growth engines. Recent clinical advances (e.g. pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation) reinforce leadership in cardiology, while acquisitions (Axonics, Silk Road, Bolt) open adjacencies (incontinence, stroke, lithotripsy). The company’s slimmed product portfolio and global footprint (U.S. channels plus Europe/Asia) enable efficient monetization of innovations worldwide.  

Margins and FCF are strong: gross margin ~75% and EBITDA margin ~30% (FY24), reflecting high-value implants. High R&D and combined operations leverage mean ~20–25% of sales flows to free cash flow. Boston Scientific has historically returned cash via modest buybacks; we expect moderate share count reduction over time (none in 2023-24) as leverage is paid down. The balance sheet (>$10B debt vs ~$0.4B cash ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Long,9%2C102)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,315))) is leveraged but supported by solid interest coverage. Management remains committed to funding the growth pipeline. Near-term catalysts include expanded FDA/CMS approvals for key products and successful integration of acquisitions.  

**Recent Developments:**  
• **Q1 2025** – Net sales $4.663B (+20.9%), vs. guidance 17–19% ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,2%7D%20basis%2C%20all%20compared%20to)). Adj. EPS $0.75 exceeded guidance $0.68 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20Mass,2%7D%20basis%2C%20all%20compared%20to)). Cardiovascular sales jumped ~26% (all beds including FARAPULSE/PFA growth), MedSurg +12.8% y/y ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,6%20percent%20organic)). Management gave only medium-term outlook.  
• **Year-end 2024:** FY net sales $16.747B (+17.6% YoY) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,05%20a%20year%20ago)). Approved acquisitions closed: Axonics (urinary implants) and Cortex (cardiac mapping) were completed ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=,a%20privately%20held)). GAAP EPS $1.25 vs $1.07 year ago ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-302368738.html#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,05%20a%20year%20ago)). On the legal/capital front, Boston Scientific completed a €2.0B senior-note offering (Oct 2023) to help fund acquisitions ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2024-302125332.html#:~:text=pulmonary%20single,planet%2C%20while%20performing%20with%20integrity)).  
• **M&A expansion:** In 2024–25 Boston Scientific broadened its portfolio: acquired Silk Road Medical ($1.6B, stroke devices) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/boston-scientific-profit-beats-heart-devices-demand-2024-07-24/#:~:text=cardiovascular%20unit%20sales%20surged%2017.8,5)); 2025 acquisitions include Bolt Medical (intravascular lithotripsy) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,coronary%20and%20peripheral%20artery%20disease)) and announced SoniVie (renal denervation) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,subject%20to%20customary%20closing%20conditions)). These moves enhance offerings in high-growth subsegments.  
• **Capital return:** No cash dividend has been paid (policy holds cash for growth) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Dividends)). The existing $1B buyback plan remains fully available (no repurchases done in ’23–’24) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=On%20December%2014%2C%202020%2C%20our,There%20were)).  
• **Regulatory:** In Dec-2024 the FDA classified a recall of Boston Scientific’s POLARx Cryoablation catheter as “most serious” after several patient injuries ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fda-classifies-recall-boston-scientific-catheters-most-serious-2024-12-18/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20has%20classified%20the,rather%20than%20remove%20the%20product)). The company issued advisories and updated usage guidelines. This event underscores the need for vigilance on device safety.  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** We forecast mid-teens organic revenue growth for FY25 as hospital procedure volumes rebound post-pandemic and new products ramp. Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments will both drive growth: for example, expanding atrial fibrillation ablation (including FARAPULSE PFA uptake), advanced stents/balloons and endoscopy systems. Currency effects should be neutral (2024 saw only modest FX impact) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2025-302435162.html#:~:text=,14%20to%2016%20percent%2C%20all)). Operating leverage is substantial: fixed R&D and SG&A investments moderate gross margins (~74–75%), so each incremental $1 of sales adds disproportionately to profit. We expect 2025 EBITDA margin to expand slightly (from ~30% in 2024) as density improves. EPS should rise roughly in line, moderated by a normalizing tax rate and minimal share dilution. In sum, we project diluted FY25 EPS of roughly $3.00 (versus $2.51 adj. EPS in 2024). The table summarizes key historical figures (FY21–24) and Q1’25:  

|  ($)          | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | 2024  | Q1’25  |  
|:--------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|-------:|  
| Net Sales (B) | 11.9  | 12.7  | 14.2  | 16.7  | 4.7    |  
| YoY Change (%)| +19.9 | +6.5  | +12.3 | +17.6 | +20.9  |  
| EPS (GAAP)    | 0.7   | 0.5   | 1.1   | 1.3   | 0.45   |  
| EPS (adjusted)| 1.6   | 1.7   | 2.1   | 2.5   | 0.75   |  

**Peer & Industry Analysis:**  Key peers include large diversified medical-device companies. Stryker Corp (SYK, $154B market cap) is comparable in growth and portfolio; Medtronic (MDT, $119B) and Abbott Labs (ABT, $220B) are more diversified health-tech players with slower recent EPS growth. Edwards Lifesciences (EW, $47B) is a heart-device specialist. The peer group’s 1-year EPS growth has ranged roughly 5–15%, with current P/Es 15–50× (SYK ~50×, MDT ~17×, ABT ~26×, EW ~31×). BSX trades at a premium (~70×) reflecting higher growth expectations. On a Value vs. Growth scatter, Boston Scientific sits firmly in the high-growth/high-valuation quadrant. Profit margins (net) are in the mid-teens for most peers; BSX’s recent GAAP margin (~11% in 2024) is comparable to peers, with an adjusted net margin ~15–18%. Our BUY rating assumes BSX maintains or modestly outgrows peers on its innovation pipeline.  

| Company (Ticker) | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-yr EPS Growth | P/E (NTM) | Net Margin (%) | Rating |  
|-----------------|------------:|----------------:|----------:|---------------:|:-------|  
| Stryker (SYK)   | 154.0       | ~15%            | ~50×      | ~12%           | BUY    |

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** Boston Scientific’s leverage is moderate. As of Dec-2024, total debt was $10.7B versus shareholders’ equity ~$21.8B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Long,9%2C102)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20stockholders%E2%80%99%20equity%20%20,35%2C136)) (Debt/Equity ≈0.5×).  Cash and marketable securities were only $0.41B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,315)), reflecting heavy investment in innovation; net debt is thus sizable. However, operating cash flow has been robust (>$3.0B annually) supporting debt service. Management targets maintaining investment-grade ratings.  No dividend has ever been paid on common stock ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=Dividends)); the policy is to reinvest cash into growth.  The $1.0B stock repurchase authorization (Dec-2020) remains fully unused ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885725/000088572525000011/bsx-20241231.htm#:~:text=On%20December%2014%2C%202020%2C%20our,There%20were)), following no buybacks in 2023-24. Our **Financial Strength** rating is **Medium-High** (adequate liquidity, manageable leverage, strong cash flow).  

**Management & Risks:**  CEO Mike Mahoney (at the helm since 2017) continues to lead strategy; the current CFO has been in place through recent earnings. Management provides only limited forward guidance (ranges) and emphasizes long-term growth targets. Key risks include:  
• **Device recalls/regulatory:**  Safety issues (e.g. late-2024 recall of the POLARx atrial fibrillation catheter after reports of serious complications ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fda-classifies-recall-boston-scientific-catheters-most-serious-2024-12-18/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20has%20classified%20the,rather%20than%20remove%20the%20product))) could dampen adoption or invite scrutiny. Regulatory changes (e.g. EU’s stringent MDR requirements, or future FDA approvals/payment codes) add compliance and reimbursement risk.  
• **Competition:** Major peers (Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Abbott, etc.) aggressively develop next-gen devices (e.g. competing PFA ablation systems) which could erode Boston Sci’s market share over time.  
• **Reimbursement & macro:** Healthcare cost containment or reduced procedure volumes in a weaker economy could slow sales growth.  Tariff disruptions pose supply risks – recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports threaten to raise component costs across medtech ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/31402296-753c-4fa9-b5bb-0c8c25ccff04#:~:text=The%20U.S.,%E2%80%94on%20imports%20from%20China%2C%20a)).  
• **Integration and execution:** Large acquisitions/expansions (Axonics, Silk Road, Bolt, etc.) carry execution risk; any delay in product launches or manufacturing could impact expected returns. 

**Company Description:** Boston Scientific is a global medical-device leader.  It operates two main segments: **MedSurg** (endoscopy, urology, neuromodulation, spinal cord stimulation, and related surgical equipment) and **Cardiovascular** (coronary/peripheral stents and balloons, electrophysiology catheters, heart rhythm-management devices, structural heart prosthetics, etc.) ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BSX/#:~:text=Boston%20Scientific%20Corporation%20develops%2C%20manufactures%2C,laser%20systems%2C%20artificial%20urinary%20sphincter)).  Its products are used in minimally-invasive procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. AFib), coronary artery disease, heart failure, urologic and gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain, and other conditions. Boston Scientific sells worldwide through direct sales teams and distributors; it has major R&D and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company was founded in 1979 and is based in Marlborough, MA ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BSX/#:~:text=Boston%20Scientific%20Corporation%20develops%2C%20manufactures%2C,laser%20systems%2C%20artificial%20urinary%20sphincter)).  

**Valuation:**  Our $110 target is based on a forward P/E (~45× on our FY26 EPS), a modest premium to Boston Scientific’s historical (25–40×) range, reflecting its above-average growth profiles. This implies 30% upside to current levels. By comparison, peers trade below 30× (Medtronic ~17×, Abbott ~26×, Edwards ~31×), underscoring BSX’s high-growth valuation.  We also compared to sector P/S (~7–8×) and found our target P/S (~6.5×) is conservative given BSX’s growth.  If the company executes well (new product rollouts, high-margin growth), we see upside to the target.  Conversely, significant execution slippage or materially lower procedure growth could justify a revision to HOLD.  

**Rating Definitions:**  Our **BUY/HOLD/SELL** ratings are relative to the broader medical-device sector (benchmarked to a health-care index) on a 12-month horizon.  **BUY** implies expected outperformance (over 10–15% upside) net of risk; **HOLD** implies roughly in line return (±10%) with moderate risk; **SELL** implies downside potential.  Our long-term (5-year) stance on Boston Scientific is moderately bullish, in line with the sector.

**Methodology & Disclaimers:**  Our analysis combines top-down industry outlooks (demographic trends, procedure volumes) with bottom-up financial modeling (segment revenue, margin, cash flow analysis).

**Analyst’s Notes:**  
• **Q1 2025 results:** Revenue $90.2 B (+12% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Consolidated%20Alphabet%20revenues%20in%20Q1,digit%20growth%20rates)); Google Services +10%, YouTube subs +10%; Google Cloud +28% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Google%20Services%20revenues%20increased%2010,and%20devices%2C%20and%20YouTube%20ads)).

Operating margin jumped 5 points to 32% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20operating%20income%20increased%2031,percentage%20points%20to%2032)); EPS $2.15 (+31%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Total%20operating%20income%20increased%2031,percentage%20points%20to%2032)). CEO Pichai highlighted AI leadership (Gemini models, AI Overviews with 1.5 B monthly users) and Cloud/YouTube “$110B run rate” ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=cash%20dividend%20of%20%240)). Board plans ~$75 B capex in 2025 to expand AI/Cloud infrastructure ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=streaming%20watchtime%20and%20podcasts,%E2%80%9D)).  
• **Capital return:** In Q1 the board raised the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.21/sh ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Alphabet%E2%80%99s%20Board%20of%20Directors%20declared,as%20of%20June%209%2C%202025)) and authorized up to $70 B in new share repurchases ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Stock%20Repurchases)), reflecting strong cash flow. FY2024 buybacks totaled ~$62 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202024)).  
• **Market backdrop:** Global digital ad spend is recovering (~+6% forecast for 2025 ([www.dentsu.com](https://www.dentsu.com/hu/en/media-and-investors/news-releases/global-ad-spend-forecasts-2025#:~:text=,of%20total%20ad))) after a mid-cycle slowdown. Alphabet’s platforms (search, YouTube, apps) maintain robust engagement. Our thesis incorporates sustained double-digit growth in Search/Ads and Cloud driven by AI upgrades, partly offset by higher TAC and R&D.  
• **Outlook:** We see continued momentum into Q2. Opex is growing more slowly than revenue, implying further leverage. Key drivers include AI-driven product enhancements (e.g. Gemini2.5 rollout) and broad cloud adoption. Risks include cost of the planned capex ramp (~$75B) and intensifying regulatory/legal scrutiny. ([www.euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/10/google-loses-24-bn-eu-antitrust-case-for-favouring-its-own-shopping-service#:~:text=In%20a%20win%20for%20the,promotion%20of%20its%20Shopping%20service)) ([www.futunn.com](https://www.futunn.com/en/learn/detail-google-fined-2-7-billion-by-the-european-union-the-cost-of-monopoly-2024-09-11-91367-240910055#:~:text=Google%20is%20also%20facing%20another,reluctance%20to%20change%20its%20practices))  

**Investment Thesis:** Alphabet’s core strength is the *full-stack AI ecosystem* underpinning its dominant advertising franchise. Google Search (≈91% global share ([www.financecharts.com](https://www.financecharts.com/compare/MSFT%2CGOOG%2CAMZN%2CNVDA%2CMETA#:~:text=%28Cruise%29%2C%20and%20various%20startups,market%20share%20of%20about%2011))) and YouTube yield massive impressions, while rapid AI innovation (Gemini) boosts engagement and monetization. Digital advertising remains a secular growth arena (global ad spend mid-single-digits growth ([www.dentsu.com](https://www.dentsu.com/hu/en/media-and-investors/news-releases/global-ad-spend-forecasts-2025#:~:text=,of%20total%20ad))), and Alphabet captures much of this via search/text and growing video ad markets. Its Google Cloud business (now ~$50B run-rate) addresses a vast multi-hundred-billion $ addressable market and is scaling rapidly with AI infrastructure demand. Investment in data centers and AI chips (announced new NVIDIA Blackwell H200 deployments ([www.thestack.technology](https://www.thestack.technology/google-cloud-is-inking-1-billion-deals-amid-ai-frenzy/#:~:text=Alphabet%20reported%20a%20record%20%24350,seven%20subsea%20cable%20projects%20underway))) supports this growth.  

Profitability and cash flow are robust for a growth company: Q1’25 operating margin was 34% and prior-year FCF exceeded $80B. Strong free cash flow funds shareholder returns; the board repurchased $62B and launched a modest dividend (now $0.84 annualized). We expect mid-teens EPS CAGR (FY20–25) due to revenue growth and modest margin expansion. Key near-term catalysts include new AI-enabled product features (e.g. *AI Overviews* in Search, Gemini-powered tools) and enterprise cloud wins (analysts note multiple $1B+ Google Cloud contracts ([www.thestack.technology](https://www.thestack.technology/google-cloud-is-inking-1-billion-deals-amid-ai-frenzy/#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%3A%20Several%20deals%20worth,1%20billion))).

Paid subscriptions (YouTube/One) topped 270M ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=as%20we%20rolled%20out%20Gemini,%E2%80%9D)).  
• *Capex & AI:* CFO Ashkenazi reiterated continued “very strong” AI demand and tight supply during Q4 ([www.thestack.technology](https://www.thestack.technology/google-cloud-is-inking-1-billion-deals-amid-ai-frenzy/#:~:text=AI%20demand%20is%20outstripping%20Google,an%20earnings%20call%20late%20Tuesday)). Alphabet will spend majority of $75B capex on servers/datacenters ([www.thestack.technology](https://www.thestack.technology/google-cloud-is-inking-1-billion-deals-amid-ai-frenzy/#:~:text=Alphabet%20reported%20a%20record%20%24350,seven%20subsea%20cable%20projects%20underway)). It discloses building 11 new cloud regions and subsea cables ([www.thestack.technology](https://www.thestack.technology/google-cloud-is-inking-1-billion-deals-amid-ai-frenzy/#:~:text=Alphabet%20reported%20a%20record%20%24350,seven%20subsea%20cable%20projects%20underway)).  
• *Capital return:* In Q1, Board approved a new $70B buyback ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Stock%20Repurchases)) and raised the quarterly dividend to $0.21/sh ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Alphabet%E2%80%99s%20Board%20of%20Directors%20declared,as%20of%20June%209%2C%202025)). FY2024 repurchases were ~$62B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202024)), and dividends totaled ~$3B (since launch late 2023).  
• *M&A:* In Mar 2025 Google announced acquisition of Wiz (cloud-security software) for ~$32B ([blog.google](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-agreement-acquire-wiz#:~:text=Google%20announces%20agreement%20to%20acquire,customers%20and%20partners%20on%20the)), expanding security offerings for Google Cloud customers.  
• *Regulatory:* In Sep 2024 the EU’s top court upheld a record €2.4B antitrust fine (Shopping service) ([www.euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/10/google-loses-24-bn-eu-antitrust-case-for-favouring-its-own-shopping-service#:~:text=In%20a%20win%20for%20the,promotion%20of%20its%20Shopping%20service)). The company awaits potential remedies after EU competition authorities signaled forced divestiture in adtech. Meanwhile the US DOJ’s antitrust trial (started Sept 2024) is probing Google’s adtech practices ([www.futunn.com](https://www.futunn.com/en/learn/detail-google-fined-2-7-billion-by-the-european-union-the-cost-of-monopoly-2024-09-11-91367-240910055#:~:text=Google%20is%20also%20facing%20another,reluctance%20to%20change%20its%20practices)).  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** Revenue increased from $283B (2022) to $307B (2023) to $350B (2024) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)) (+9% and +14%). FY net income rose 59.97→73.80→100.12 ($B) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-income#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)), with diluted EPS $4.56→5.80→8.04 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021)). Growth in 2025 is driven by broad demand: Search & YouTube ads (Google Services) was +10% in Q1’25 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Google%20Services%20revenues%20increased%2010,and%20devices%2C%20and%20YouTube%20ads)), while Cloud revenue grew ~28%. Other Bets remain small and unprofitable (~$0.45B revenue Q1). Margin leverage is improving: FY operating margin was ~32% (vs ~27% in 2023) . Tax/other items boosted EPS in Q1 (46% net income growth), though we exclude one‐time nonrecurring gains for core forecasting. Incentives compliances: TAC rose modestly (to ~$13.7B in Q1) as ad spend grew. We expect FY2025 operating leverage similar to FY2024 with modest SG&A growth, offset by ~$75B capex. Diluted EPS bridge: driven by ~+12% revenue growth and share count ~1% lower (buybacks), slightly offset by higher interest in 2025.

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** Key peers include Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and NVIDIA. MSFT (mkt cap ~$3.0T) reported ~36% net margin ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/net-profit-margin#:~:text=2023,33.25)), ~20–30% EPS growth, and trades ~30x ’25 EPS. META (~$0.8T) has ~38% margin ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/META/meta-platforms/net-profit-margin#:~:text=2024,32.06)) and FY25 earnings rebounding (~+180% EPS growth) at ~20x P/E. AMZN (~$1.6T) has thin operating margins (~5–6%) and higher valuation (~70x trailing P/E). NVDA (~$1.1T) sports ~50%+ margins and >200% EPS growth, trading near 40–50x. By contrast, Alphabet’s ~32% op margin and mid-30s% net margin sit between high-growth peers (NVDA/META) and mature tech. On a Value vs. Growth axis, Alphabet is a moderate growth name – faster growth than legacy tech but lower P/E than the fastest growers. Our BUY rating reflects a view that Alphabet’s AI execution earns a favorable risk-adjusted return.  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** At end-2024 Alphabet held ~$110.9 B in cash+marketable securities ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,95%2C657)) against only ~$11.9 B of long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=Long,4%2C694)) (debt/equity ≪1). Working capital is strongly positive (~$75 B). Liquidity is ample to fund capex and buybacks. Management targets FCF >$60B annually (after capex). Payout policy: a modest dividend (initiated 2023) now ~0.5% yield (raised 5% to $0.21/qtr in 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000040/googexhibit991q12025.htm#:~:text=Alphabet%E2%80%99s%20Board%20of%20Directors%20declared,as%20of%20June%209%2C%202025))) and aggressive buybacks ($61.8B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000010/googexhibit991q42024.htm#:~:text=,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202024)) plus $70B new authorization). We rate Alphabet’s balance sheet *Medium-High* strength: debt is minimal and free cash flow very high. Outstanding share count is declining (13.31 B in 2024 to ~13.15 B in Q1’25 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,decline%20from%202022))) reflecting buybacks.  

**Management & Risks:** CEO Sundar Pichai (in role since 2019) and CFO Anat Ashkenazi (from mid-2024 ([technologymagazine.com](https://technologymagazine.com/digital-transformation/anat-ashkenazi-named-as-new-google-cfo-to-replace-ruth-porat#:~:text=Anat%20Ashkenazi%20Named%20as%20New,The%20Eli))) lead a long-tenured executive team. Alphabet has improved transparency (now reports segment metrics and capital plans) and offers guidance on capex. Key risks: **Regulation:** Antitrust actions (EU fines ([www.euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/10/google-loses-24-bn-eu-antitrust-case-for-favouring-its-own-shopping-service#:~:text=In%20a%20win%20for%20the,promotion%20of%20its%20Shopping%20service)), potential divestitures, US DOJ adtech trial ([www.futunn.com](https://www.futunn.com/en/learn/detail-google-fined-2-7-billion-by-the-european-union-the-cost-of-monopoly-2024-09-11-91367-240910055#:~:text=Google%20is%20also%20facing%20another,reluctance%20to%20change%20its%20practices))) could constrain business. **Macro:** Ad budgets are cyclical; a weaker economy could slow growth (despite +5–6% industry forecasts ([www.dentsu.com](https://www.dentsu.com/hu/en/media-and-investors/news-releases/global-ad-spend-forecasts-2025#:~:text=,of%20total%20ad))). **Competition:** Fierce rivalry in ads and AI from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others; Apple’s privacy changes and TikTok’s ad inroads reduce Google’s ad saturation. **Tech execution:** Heavy capex and R&D (>$75B planned) are needed to sustain AI leadership; delays could hurt margins. **Geopolitics:** Bans or restrictions in China (core services not available there) limit international growth. **Privacy/data:** Evolving privacy regulations or breaches could add costs.  

**Company Description:** Alphabet Inc. is a global technology conglomerate. Its primary brand, Google, provides internet search, digital advertising, cloud services, and a host of consumer products (YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail, Chrome, etc.). Alphabet’s *“Other Bets”* include initiatives in self-driving cars (Waymo), health tech (Verily), and high-altitude internet (Loon). Google’s advertising platforms (Search, YouTube, Display, Google Network) generate most revenue. The company has ~179,000 employees and operates worldwide (though certain services are restricted in markets like China). Alphabet dominates online search (~91% global market share ([www.financecharts.com](https://www.financecharts.com/compare/MSFT%2CGOOG%2CAMZN%2CNVDA%2CMETA#:~:text=%28Cruise%29%2C%20and%20various%20startups,market%20share%20of%20about%2011))) and is a top-3 cloud provider.  

**Valuation:** Our $185 target uses a blended approach. Alphabet is earning ~\$8.5/sh (FY25E) in our model; we apply ~22x P/E, slightly below its 5-yr median (~24x) and roughly in line with peer targets. This multiple implies mid-to-high-teens total return to target, reflecting a modest premium to tech average given robust growth and cash flow. By contrast, Microsoft and Meta trade nearer ~30x while Amazon and Apple trade higher. On a discounted cash flow basis, Alphabet’s FCF yield of ~3% (post-capex) supports our valuation. The target multiple implies P/E shrinkage vs. history (PE compressing from ~22x to ~20x), reflecting higher share count from buybacks winding down and modest margin pressure from capex. Upside catalysts: faster AI adoption, stronger ad market. Downside triggers: sustained ad spend weakness or costly regulatory remedies.  

**Ratings Reference:** **BUY/HOLD/SELL** – A *Buy* rating means we expect total return above the benchmark (typically S&P 500) over 12 months on a risk-adjusted basis. *Hold* suggests performance roughly in line with the benchmark. *Sell* implies anticipated underperformance. (We apply similar logic for long-term 5-year views; sector stance indicates an analyst’s relative weighting.)

**Methodology & Disclaimers:** Our research combines top-down industry analysis (digital ad trends, AI adoption, cloud market) with bottom-up financial modeling. We consider economic forecasts, competitive positioning, financial strength, and management strategy. Valuation uses both relative multiples and discounted cash flow. Key assumptions (e.g. ad growth, margin trends) are stressed against sensitivities. This report is provided for informational purposes; it does not constitute individualized investment advice.

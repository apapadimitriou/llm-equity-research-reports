# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1’25 results:** Sales $15.5B (–2% y/y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=%245,to%20%241.3%20billion%2C%20they)); adj EPS $2.22 (+7%, beat) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=Merck%20reported%20a%207,to%20%241.3%20billion%2C%20they)). Oncology drove results: Keytruda $7.2B (+4%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=met%20analyst%20projections,to%20%241.6%20billion)); WINREVAIR launched with $280M in net sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=met%20analyst%20projections,to%20%241.6%20billion)). Animal Health was $1.6B (+5%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=%247,to%20%241.6%20billion)). SG&A and R&D rose (investing in launches/pipeline).  
• **Guidance:** Reaffirmed FY2025 sales $64.1–65.6B; trimmed adj EPS to $8.82–$8.97 (higher tariffs/licensing costs, about $200M) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)). This implies modest revenue growth with high-margin product mix. FX and volume assumptions remain roughly flat.  
• **Vaccines:** GARDASIL sales plunged (–41% in Q1 to $1.3B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=%245,to%20%241.3%20billion%2C%20they))) after halting China shipments ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,in%20premarket%20trading.%20The)); FY25 outlook reflects this inventory correction. Other vaccines (ProQuad, etc.) grew modestly. Blood-thinner Januvia/Janumet sales continue declining on generic competition.  
• **Pipeline/Deals:** Positive late-stage and regulatory progress. FDA accepted an RSV long-acting antibody (Clesrovimab) NDA ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,1%20Receptor%20Agonist)); top-line Phase-3 results reported for a subcutaneous Keytruda combo in late ’24 ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,1%20Receptor%20Agonist)). Merck expanded its pipeline via BD: e.g. acquired Modifi Biosciences (brain-cancer biotech) for up to \$1.3B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-buys-cancer-therapy-developer-modifi-biosciences-up-13-bln-2024-10-23/#:~:text=Merck%20has%20announced%20the%20acquisition,clinical%20cancer%20therapies%20designed%20to)). These augment the future growth engine, even as some trials (e.g. favezelimab in CRC ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-colorectal-cancer-therapy-fails-late-stage-trial-2024-09-25/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20setback%20as,Other%20ongoing))) have failed.  
• **Costs & Operating Leverage:** R&D spending jumped (~45% y/y in Q1 due to upfront license/deal amortization) while gross margins held ~70%. Operating leverage is modest: margins are supplemented by price increases/volume gains. Ongoing tariffs and trade measures (estimated \$200M hit)  ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)) will pressure near-term profitability.  
• **Weakness in China:** A key headwind is China’s anti-graft campaign and inventory overhang, especially for GARDASIL ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,in%20premarket%20trading.%20The)). Demand in other international markets remains healthy, partially offsetting China.  

# Investment Thesis  
Merck is a **large-cap pharmaceutical** with a diversified portfolio across oncology (Keytruda), vaccines (Gardasil, Vaxneuvance, Prevymis, etc.), cardio-metabolic (Januvia/Janumet), and animal health.  Its secular growth drivers are robust: aging populations and rising disease prevalence underpin Keytruda’s global adoption. Keytruda sales reached ~$29.5B in 2024 (18% growth) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,29)), and expanding indications (e.g. earlier-stage cancers) sustain momentum. Gardasil’s long-term market (HPV prevention) remains multi-billion, as do vaccines for RSV, meningitis and others. Merck’s pipeline also includes promising candidates (e.g. novel PD-1 bispecifics) and complementary acquisitions, positioning it well in high-value niches.  

Merck has **high-margin, cash-generative** businesses. Gross margins ~70% (on drug sales) facilitate strong free cash flow (~\$21.5B from operations in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,%284%2C388%29))). This supports a shareholder-friendly policy: a 5% dividend hike (to \$0.81/qtr) in early ’25 ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-first-quarter-2025-dividend/#:~:text=November%2019%2C%202024%2012%3A22%20pm,ET)), and an open-ended \$10B repurchase authorization ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828024045689/mrk-20240930.htm#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20Merck%E2%80%99s%20Board%20of,an%20exchange%2C%20or%20in%20privately)). The balance sheet is solid (cash \$13B vs. debt \$37B) with manageable leverage ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20debt%20to%20total%20liabilities,0.6%3A1)). We rate *Financial Strength: Medium-High,* given diversified earnings and coverage ratios (2024 op. cash covers ~0.6× debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20debt%20to%20total%20liabilities,0.6%3A1)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,%284%2C388%29))). Dividend yield is ~2.6% and growing, with expected future increases.  

**Catalysts:** Near-term catalysts include new drug launches and trials. Planned U.S. launches (e.g. subcutaneous Keytruda injection in late 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-plans-us-launch-subcutaneous-version-keytruda-october-1-2025-03-27/#:~:text=Merck%20%26%20Co%20announced%20plans,The))) could expand market reach. Additional clinical readouts, label expansions (e.g. for Keytruda or Winrevair), or successful pipeline deals would accelerate growth. A rebound in Gardasil demand or easing of China-related issues would re-open a sizable revenue stream  ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,in%20premarket%20trading.%20The)). On the margin side, any reduction in tariff/headwind costs or price increases in core therapies would boost EPS. FDA approvals (e.g. RSV antibody, WINREVAIR) and broad uptake amplify growth.  

# Recent Developments  
• **Feb 2025 (4Q24 results):** 4Q sales were \$15.6B (+7%) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Sales%20%20,N%2FM)); FY2024 revenue \$64.2B (+7%) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Sales%20%20,N%2FM)) was driven by strong oncology and animal health despite China vaccine weakness. FY GAAP EPS was \$6.74 (Non-GAAP \$7.65) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=Generally%20Accepted%20Accounting%20Principles%20,quarter%20of%202024%20include%20a)). Keytruda sales grew 19% in FY24 to \$29.5B ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,29)). Management reaffirmed FY25 sales \$64.1–65.6B and trimmed EPS to \$8.88–9.03 (reflecting ~\$0.09/share LaNova milestone and tariffs) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Full,Anticipated%20Milestone%20Payment%20to%20LaNova)).  
• **Vaccines:** In Feb ’25, Merck paused Gardasil shipments to China ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,in%20premarket%20trading.%20The)). 4Q24 Gardasil sales fell 17% to \$1.55B ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=devaluation%20of%20Argentine%20peso%2C%20which,Decline%20primarily%20due%20to%20lower)) (98% of last year’s Chinese demand). The pause is expected to continue through at least 2025, lowering vaccine sales forecasts. Other vaccine franchises (e.g. rotavirus, shingles) remain on track globally.  
• **New Products:** Late 2024 – FDA accepted an NDA for Clesrovimab (RSV preventive antibody) for infants ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results/#:~:text=,1%20Receptor%20Agonist)). 2025 – Plan to launch subcutaneous Keytruda August 2025 (pending FDA approval) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-plans-us-launch-subcutaneous-version-keytruda-october-1-2025-03-27/#:~:text=Merck%20%26%20Co%20announced%20plans,The)), which would reduce administration time and broaden use. Winrevair (for PAH) is ramping post-launch.  
• **M&A and Partnerships:** Oct 2024 – Agreed to buy Modifi Biosciences (glioblastoma/brain cancer biotech) for up to \$1.3B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-buys-cancer-therapy-developer-modifi-biosciences-up-13-bln-2024-10-23/#:~:text=Merck%20has%20announced%20the%20acquisition,clinical%20cancer%20therapies%20designed%20to)). 2024 – Entered/expanded multiple R&D collaborations (e.g. cancer immunity deals, GLP-1 licensing) to shore up pipeline.  
• **Dividend & Buybacks:** Nov 2024 – Board raised Q1’25 dividend to \$0.81 (from \$0.77) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-first-quarter-2025-dividend/#:~:text=November%2019%2C%202024%2012%3A22%20pm,ET)) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-dividend/#:~:text=July%2023%2C%202024%2012%3A52%20pm,ET)) (annual ~$3.24, ~5% raise) and continued share repurchases under the \$10B authorization.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Merck’s revenue growth is driven by expanding volumes in its core franchises and by pricing where allowable, offset by declines in older lines. Keytruda volume has been robust (ex-US and less commoditized indications), while insulin and older cardiovascular drugs face generic erosion. Vaccine revenues are volatile due to shipping patterns and inventory (especially in China). We expect **2025 sales +4–5%**, held back by Gardasil China; beyond that, low-single-digit growth as new drugs (Winrevair, RSV) and international expansion partly compensate patent expiries/deprioritizations.  

**Operating leverage:** R&D and SG&A have been growing (Q1’25 SG&A +8% y/y; R&D +45% on Wyeth acquisitions and new programs ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Adjustments%20to%20reconcile%20net%20income,1%2C824))), which dampens near-term operating leverage. Operating margin (~34% in FY24) should inch up modestly as new products scale. EPS Bridge FY24→FY25: we project mid-single-digit core EPS growth, offset by one-time charges ($200M tariffs, \$0.09 LaNova milestone) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)). Tax rate will normalize (~15.5% guidance) vs. unusually low charges in ’23. Overall, we see FY25 GAAP EPS around \$8.90 (midpoint of guidance).

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
**Selected peers:** Eli Lilly (LLY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV). See table below. Compared to peers, Merck trades at modest multiples: 2024 P/E ~~14× (forward) vs. LLY ~55×, JNJ ~17×, ABBV ~19× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PFE/pfizer/pe-ratio#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20%28LLY%29%20%20,0.00)). Merck’s 1-year EPS growth is modest (~10–15% ex-inventory swing), lower than high-growth LLY (~25–30%) but similar to established names (JNJ, ABBV mid-single-digit). Net margins (20–30%) are above broader pharma due to patent-protected brands; Merck’s ~35%+ operating margin sits in the upper quartile. In a **Value vs. Growth** context, Merck is a “core” stock: it has stable dividends and moderate growth. Lilly represents Growth (high R&D, fast expansion), whereas Abbott/AbbVie are more mature/Value. JNJ is large-diversified (split of consumer and MedTech distorts pure pharma comps). Merck’s combination of yield (~2.6%) and pipeline-driven growth puts it between Value and Growth (essentially Market Weight). Our rating (HOLD) reflects this middle positioning relative to peers; we would lean BUY if secular growth (especially oncology/vaccines) accelerates or Valuation contracts, and SELL if pipeline disappoints or pricing pressures rise.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Merck’s balance sheet is solid. **Cash:** \$13.3B (end-2024) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=included%20in%20Other%20current%20assets,12%2C773)). **Working capital:** roughly \$10–11B positive. **Debt:** \$34.5B LT + \$2.6B current ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828024045689/mrk-20240930.htm#:~:text=Loans%20payable%20and%20current%20portion,33%2C683)) vs. equity ~\$61B; debt/total capital ~32% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20debt%20to%20total%20liabilities,0.6%3A1)). 2024 operating cash flow was \$21.5B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828025007732/mrk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20Cash%20Provided%20by%20Operating,%284%2C388%29)), covering most debt. 2024 capex was \$3.4B (stylized 5–6% of sales). Liquidity and interest coverage are robust (cash/short debt >> 1), leading us to assign Financial Strength **Medium-High**.  

Merck targets ~$10B in buybacks (open-ended authorization) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000162828024045689/mrk-20240930.htm#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20Merck%E2%80%99s%20Board%20of,an%20exchange%2C%20or%20in%20privately)), and shareholder distributions are conservative. Dividends have grown steadily. In Nov’24, the board **increased the quarterly dividend to \$0.81** (from \$0.77) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-first-quarter-2025-dividend/#:~:text=November%2019%2C%202024%2012%3A22%20pm,ET)) ([www.merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-2024-dividend/#:~:text=July%2023%2C%202024%2012%3A52%20pm,ET)) (~5% raise), for an annual \$3.24 (~2.7% yield). The payout ratio remains under 60% (given $6–9 EPS), leaving room for future hikes. We expect continued modest dividend growth, funded by free cash flow. Share count is gradually declining (2.531B in Q1’25, down ~0.5% y/y) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRK/merck/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)) due to buybacks.

**Management:** CEO Robert M. Davis (appointed 2021) and CFO Helene von Roeder (joined mid-2023) have delivered consistent execution. The company provides regular guidance and uses clear non-GAAP metrics (with full reconciliation). Merck emphasizes pipeline milestones and operating efficiency in its reports. Governance is solid, with no recent management controversies.  

**Key Risks:**  
- **Regulatory:** US drug pricing reforms (Medicare negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act) pose a major long-term risk. Keytruda (\~\$29.5B sales) is expected to face pricing negotiations in 2026, with cuts by 2028 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-expects-cancer-therapy-keytruda-be-part-government-price-setting-2026-2025-02-25/#:~:text=Merck%20anticipates%20its%20leading%20cancer,for%20ten%20prescription%20drugs)). Patent expirations (Keytruda ~2028, Gardasil ~2030s) will attract generic/biosim competition. Healthcare reforms or importation policies could further pressure prices.  
- **Macroeconomic/Geopolitical:** Tariffs/Trade – Merck cited \$200M in new U.S. pharma tariffs for ’25 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-posts-higher-profit-puts-tariffs-cost-200-million-2025-04-24/#:~:text=For%20the%20year%202025%2C%20Merck,for%20boosting%20domestic%20pharmaceutical%20manufacturing)). China – ongoing anti-bribery campaigns have depressed vaccine and prescription sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-pauses-gardasil-shipments-china-hitting-its-2025-outlook-2025-02-04/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20suspension%20of,in%20premarket%20trading.%20The)). Global recessions or currency swings could hurt volume.  
- **Competitive:** Intensifying competition from other pharma (e.g. weight-loss/diabetes drugs, other cancer immunotherapies). Failure of key trials (e.g. recent favezelimab miss ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-colorectal-cancer-therapy-fails-late-stage-trial-2024-09-25/#:~:text=Merck%20announced%20a%20setback%20as,Other%20ongoing))) can stall growth.  
- **Operational:** Execution risks in manufacturing and supply (e.g. ensuring Winrevair and new products meet demand). Integration of acquisitions or alliances may not be smooth.  
- **Litigation/Compliance:** As a large pharma, exposure to patent litigation or regulatory fines (notable past cases include Zetia/Merck shortage issues) could arise, though no current major litigation news as of Apr ’25.  

# Company Description  
Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside North America, is a leading global healthcare company. Its core business is pharmaceutical products and vaccines for human and animal health. Merck’s network spans worldwide R&D and manufacturing facilities, with a broad supplier/distribution network. Product lines include oncology (Keytruda and Lynparza partnerships), cardiovascular/metabolic (Januvia, heart failure drugs), vaccines (HPV, pneumococcal, rotavirus, shingles, and emerging RSV), and animal health (~companion and livestock vaccines/medicines). The company supplements its internal R&D with strategic licensing and acquisitions to maximize its roughly \$12B annual R&D investment.  

# Valuation  
Our \$125 target is based on a multiple approach. We apply ~14× 2025E EPS (~\$8.9) versus the current ~13×, reflecting modest re-rating toward Merck’s 5-year average (~14–15×) and peer valuations (large pharma ~16×). This implies ~6% upside from today’s price. By comparison, peers trade at 16–18× (JNJ, ABBV) or far higher (growth leader Lilly ~55×). The implied multiple reflects Merck’s solid midteens growth potential and ~3% yield; it is a slight premium to historical trough levels (~12×), arguing for limited downside. If key catalysts materialize (e.g. stronger-than-expected Keytruda uptake or vaccine recovery), a higher multiple is warranted (upside would likely narrow the premium, possibly to 15–16×). Conversely, sustained weakness in China or new pricing pressures would argue for a lower multiple (downgrading to SELL if the multiple falls toward historical lows or fundamentals deteriorate).  

*Upside Scenario:* Outperformance hinges on blockbuster drugs exceeding forecasts, significant pipeline approvals, or easing of China headwinds. A sustained Keytruda acceleration or new indication (e.g. adjuvant therapies) could prompt an upgrade.  
*Downside Scenario:* Continued weak Gardasil demand, heavier pricing cuts (U.S. or EU), or trial failures could force us to cut estimates and grow bearish. Our rating would be lowered if FY25 guidance is missed or new regulatory burdens appear.  

# Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months. (BENCHMARK = S&P 500.) *Example phrasing:* “Projected to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than the market average.”  
- **HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the broad market over 12 months. *Example:* “Projected to deliver returns similar to the market average, after accounting for risk.”  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months. *Example:* “Projected to yield lower risk-adjusted returns than the market.”  

*Long-term stance:* We maintain a neutral/Gross Overweight bias over 5-year horizon for core-quality pharma. Sector stance is Market Weight (healthcare).  

# Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis combines top-down industry outlook and bottom-up company fundamentals. We consider overall healthcare demand trends, Merck’s competitive positions in key therapy areas, product pipeline and patent timelines, and financial health (liquidity, margins, cash flow). We build an intrinsic valuation model (DCF and multiples) and compare to peer multiples and historical norms. We factor management track record and risks (regulatory, geopolitical). This report is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell Merck securities. It does not constitute investment advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence. Past performance does not guarantee future results; all metrics are as of report date unless otherwise noted.

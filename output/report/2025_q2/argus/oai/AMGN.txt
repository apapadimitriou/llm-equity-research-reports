FDA has lifted hold on AMG 513 (another obesity agent) and Phase 1 is enrolling ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=AMG%20513)).

These catalysts underpin our bullish stance.  

## Investment Thesis  
Amgen is a global biotech leader with diversified franchises (cardiovascular/cholesterol, bone health, oncology/hematology, inflammation and rare diseases) and an expanding obesity/GLP‐1 pipeline. Established products (Repatha, Prolia/Xgeva, Neulasta, Enbrel) generate steady cash, while newer launches and acquisitions (Evenity, Tepezza, Tezspire, Blincyto, Breyanzi, Horizon’s assets) fuel mid‐term growth. The firm’s addressable markets are large: for example, U.S. osteoporosis, hypercholesterolemia, and immunology markets are sizable and growing with aging demographics. Obesity is a multi‐hundred-billion-dollar opportunity, and Amgen’s MariTide (GLP-1/GIP) and AMG 513 target this market ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,and%20tolerability%20of%C2%A0maridebart%20cafraglutide%20is)) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,is%20anticipated%20in%20H2%202025)). Similarly, its olpasiran targets the huge lipoprotein(a) cardiovascular risk market ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,initiated%20in%20H2%202025%2FH1%202026)).  

Amgen’s margin and cash profile are robust. Non-GAAP operating margins are mid/high-40s (FY24: 46.9%) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=billion%20to%20%244,9)). The firm converted ~$10.4B of cash flow in FY24 ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,by%20higher%20net%20interest%20expense)), funding a ~3% yield dividend (raised ~6% YoY) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,the%20Company%20reduced%20principal%20debt)) and excess debt reduction. Together with modest buybacks, this yields attractive shareholder returns. We see Amgen’s dividend as secure (payout ~30% of earnings) and likely to grow with earnings; free cash is ample (FCF/Share ~ $20 in FY24). Even after paid $10B+ for Horizon in 2023, Amgen reduced debt further in 2024–25. Our financial strength rating is “Medium,” reflecting strong cash flow offset by leverage.  

Near-term catalysts include expected obesity drug data (MariTide Phase 2 in H2’25 ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,is%20anticipated%20in%20H2%202025))) and continued core drug uptake (Repatha, Tezspire), plus new indications (e.g. Uplizna). We believe the stock’s current valuation (~15× 2025 EPS) understates these drivers. Maintain Buy on the view that Amgen combines stable cash cows with high-risk/high-reward pipeline bets, positioning it between defensive value and growth. Upside catalysts (big obesity wins, strong CV data) far outweigh near-term pressures. Conversely, pipeline failures or accelerated biosimilar erosion would be key warning signs.

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Amgen’s revenue growth has been driven mainly by volume gains in new/specialty drugs, offsetting pricing and biosimilar headwinds. FY2024 product sales climbed 19% (to $33.4B) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,Excluding%20sales%20from%20our%20Horizon)) (7% ex-Horizon), on 23% volume pick-up (net price -2%). Non-GAAP EPS rose 6% to $19.84 ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=%2A%20Non,higher%20operating%20expenses%2C%20including%20incremental)). Free cash flow jumped (FY24: $10.4B vs. $7.4B in ’23) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,by%20higher%20net%20interest%20expense)) reflecting higher earnings and positive working-capital timing. In Q1’25, revenue was $8.1B (+9% Y/Y) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,sales%20grew%2014)) and non-GAAP EPS $4.90 (+24%) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=GAAP%20operating%20margin%20increased%201,6%20billion%C2%A0and)), as a tough year-ago quarter (Otezla sale) eased. Operating leverage is present: EBITD A margin expanded sequentially even as SG&A and R&D are being ramped (FY24 SG&A +7%, R&D +11% on late-stage trials) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=acquired%20from%20Horizon%20and%20lower,Selling%2C%20General)).  

The EPS bridge to FY25 reflects continued product volume growth offsetting pricing and biosimilars (we model ~8–10% topline growth, yielding FY25 non-GAAP EPS ~$20.5). Key drivers include stronger Repatha/Prolia sales and Uplizna expansion, while headwinds include Enbrel/Amjevita declines and biosimilars for Prolia/XGEVA ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=5,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)). Incentive compensation aligns with long-term growth; Amgen targets ~10–12% long-term sales CAGR from pipeline. Operating leverage is high on incremental sales, so each ++% in revenue feeds heavily to profit. We expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth in FY25 (absent new impairments).

## Peer & Industry Analysis  
We benchmark Amgen against large-cap biotech/pharma peers: AbbVie (ABBV), Gilead (GILD), Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). All operate globally in life sciences (Amgen’s focus is biologics). Amgen’s recent EPS growth (~mid-single digits) lies between stable mature biotech (AbbVie, Gilead) and high-growth pharma (Lilly). Its current ~15× forward P/E is roughly in line with industry (~15–20×) and below high-growth names (LLY ~30×) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=%2A%20Non,higher%20operating%20expenses%2C%20including%20incremental)) ([investors.amgen.com](https://investors.amgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial/#:~:text=%2A%20Non,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20decreased%201.7)). Operating margins (~46% non-GAAP) are above peers (GILD ~40%, ABBV ~55%) reflecting efficient biotech operations. We place Amgen between “value” (JNJ, ABBV – strong cash, lower growth) and “growth” (LLY, biotech disruptors) on the Value–Growth spectrum. The company’s Yield and defensive product base tilt it slightly toward the value side, but its robust R&D pipeline gives it a growth premium.

*Data estimates based on recent filings and consensus. Amgen’s position: moderate growth, high dividend/high margin — near the value end vs peers.*  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
Amgen’s balance sheet: as of 3/31/25, cash $8.8B ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Current%20assets%3A%20%20,6%2C782)), debt $57.4B (including $54.0B long-term) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,4%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0March%2031%2C%202025)). Net debt ~$48.6B (including $9.1B deferred tax liabilities), yielding a net debt/EBITDA in the mid-single digits. Working capital is positive (~$3.9B) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Current%20assets%3A%20%20,6%2C782)) ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Total%20current%20liabilities%20%20,2%2C349)) (vs $5.9B at end-’24). Equity is ~$6.2B ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=Total%20stockholders%27%20equity%20%20,537)), so leverage is high (~9x equity). Free cash flow is very strong (FY24 FCF ≈$10.4B ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/02/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-results#:~:text=,by%20higher%20net%20interest%20expense))). We rate Financial Strength **Medium**: ample liquidity and earnings power provide ample cushion, but high debt levels and recent M&A expenses (Horizon, Otezla write-down) warrant caution.  

Amgen’s payout policy is shareholder-friendly. The quarterly dividend is steadily growing (6% YoY raise to $2.38/Q in Q1’25 ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,the%20Company%20reduced%20principal%20debt))). Trailing four-quarter dividends ≈ $9.52/sh (3.0% yield on ~$318 stock). Dividend coverage is healthy (~30% of non-GAAP earnings). The company also buys back stock opportunistically (authorization up to $0.5B ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,exceed%20%24500%C2%A0million)); none repurchased in Q1). We expect dividends to continue growing with earnings; net share count should hold flat to slightly down if buybacks resume after deleveraging.  

## Management & Risks  
Amgen’s leadership (CEO Robert Bradway; CFO Peter Griffith) has long tenure and provides clear, conservative guidance. Management communicates transparently on R&D spending and pipeline milestones, maintaining quarterly updates. We anticipate stable governance with a focus on R&D productivity and return of capital.  

Key risks include:  
• **Regulatory/Policy:** U.S. drug pricing reforms (Medicare negotiations) and potential tariffs create uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amgen-quarterly-profit-tops-wall-street-view-sales-up-11-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Street%20estimates,recently%20committed%20to%20a%20%24900)). Any unfavorable pricing legislation or inflation policies could hurt industry profits. EU price caps and global health reforms pose additional risk.  
• **Competition:** Rapid biosimilar entry for high-volume products (e.g. Humira biosimilars already launched, Neupogen/Neulasta, planned denosumab biosimilars) threatens core sales. Amgen expects significant biosimilar-driven erosion in 2H’25 for Prolia/XGEVA ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=5,second%20half%20of%20the%20year)). Intense competition in GLP-1/weight-loss (from Novo, Lilly, etc.) could pressure pricing on MariTide or AMG 513. ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amgen-profit-beats-estimates-next-maritide-studies-start-by-mid-year-2025-02-04/#:~:text=promising%20results%20in%20mid,share%2C%20surpassing%20analyst%20expectations%2C%20with))  
• **R&D/Pipeline:** Clinical setbacks (trial failures, safety holds) could derail growth. FDA recently paused AMG 513’s program (phase 1) on safety ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amgen-profit-beats-estimates-next-maritide-studies-start-by-mid-year-2025-02-04/#:~:text=promising%20results%20in%20mid,share%2C%20surpassing%20analyst%20expectations%2C%20with)). Any negative news on MariTide or other late-stage drugs would disproportionately impact the stock. Conversely, delayed approvals (e.g. Uplizna label) are a timing risk.  
• **Currency/Global:** Significant foreign sales (~30% of total) expose Amgen to FX volatility. Global supply-chain disruptions or manufacturing issues (e.g. China/India vaccine trade issues) could affect output. Geopolitical tensions (tariffs, trade wars) remain unsettled.  
• **Financial:** High leverage (net debt ~48B) limits flexibility. An economic downturn or higher interest rates could strain metrics. Continued Otezla acquisition charges (an $800M impairment hit Q1’25 ([www.amgen.com](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/05/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=resulting%20from%20an%20unrealized%20gain,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202025))) underscore integration risk.  
• **Covid/Other:** Epidemiological or macro shocks (pandemics, global recessions) could suppress healthcare spending temporarily, affecting near-term sales.  

## Company Description  
Amgen Inc. (Amgen.com) is a leading U.S. biotech company focused on novel biologic and small-molecule therapies. Its core therapeutic areas include oncology (e.g. Neulasta, Kyprolis, Lumakras), cardiovascular (Repatha, Lokelma), bone and immune diseases (Prolia/XGEVA, EVENITY, Enbrel, Otezla), and rare diseases (Blincyto, RAVICTI, KRYSTEXXA). The company’s products are marketed worldwide, with roughly two-thirds of sales in the U.S. and one-third in international markets. Amgen also has an emerging pipeline in inflammation and metabolic diseases: notable candidates include Tezspire (severe asthma), weight-loss GLP-1/GIP agent MariTide, and olpasiran for high Lp(a). Following acquisitions (e.g. Horizon Therapeutics in 2023), its portfolio expanded into endocrinology (Tepezza for thyroid eye disease) and rare neurology (Uplizna). Amgen invests heavily in its R&D facilities (e.g. manufacturing expansions in Ohio) and chemistry/biologics platforms to sustain growth.  

## Valuation  
Our 12-month target of USD 350 reflects a ~17× multiple on projected FY2026 EPS (assuming ~ $20.5 in non-GAAP EPS) and ~5.0× revenue – in line with historical and peer valuations. This methodology combines a P/E comparison to large pharma/biotech (which trades ~15–20× forward EPS) and a discounted cash flow model yielding a similar fair value. At the target, Amgen would trade near its 5-year mid-cycle P/E (historical average ~16×). The target assumes no major pipeline setbacks; a significant beat or pipeline approval could justify higher multiples. Conversely, approval delays or market share loss would temper valuation. Our view is that Upside/Downside is balanced; material positive data (e.g. MariTide FDA filing) would further drive the stock, while any broad-market sell-off or disruptive policy change would press logistic. A sustained >10% deviation from fair value would prompt a rating reassessment.  

## Ratings Reference (12-mo)  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform the market (~S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. Growth prospects and cash flows justify a premium.  
- **HOLD:** Expected to roughly match market performance; fundamental catalysts and risks are balanced.  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform the market; material negative outlook or valuation concerns.  

*Long-term (5-year) Bias:* Prevailing sector trends +/+ (Amgen benefits from secular health care/biotech trends).  
*Sector Stance:* Overweight – we favor health care/biotech for long-term growth and defensive yield.  

## Methodology & Disclaimers  
We employ a blended top-down/bottom-up framework: assessing the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry outlook, Amgen’s addressable markets and competitive positioning, and its financial and operational health. We forecast growth via key revenue drivers (volume, price, new products) and model free cash flow to value the stock using both P/E multiples and DCF analysis. Our rating reflects a forward 12-month, risk-adjusted view of return potential. This report is for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and consult personal advisors. Past performance is not indicative of future results; all forward-looking statements involve risks.

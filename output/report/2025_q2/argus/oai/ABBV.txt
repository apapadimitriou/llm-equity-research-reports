(Declines reflect clickskin-tourism and competitive pressures.)  
• AbbVie raised 2025 guidance: adjusted EPS to \$12.09–\$12.29 (from \$11.99–\$12.19) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,Through%20the%20First%20Quarter%202025)), reflecting stronger immunology sales and Anand “boost”.  

**Investment Thesis:** AbbVie is a dominant franchise in autoimmune/immunology (psoriasis, RA, Crohn’s) and oncology (hematologic cancers). Secular drivers include aging populations and a shift to specialty biologics. The upcoming Abrysvo (vaccines?) and advanced pipeline acquisitions (ImmunoGen, Cerevel) bolster long-term growth. Margin profile is healthy (high-teens operating margin) and FCF generation is strong – supporting a ~4% yield (recent 6¢ qtrly raise to \$1.64 vs \$1.55 prior ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-02-13-AbbVie-Declares-Quarterly-Dividend#:~:text=dividend%20of%20%241))) and share repurchases. Our thesis revolves around sustaining high-single-digit revenue growth from Skyrizi/Rinvoq ramp and new launches, offsetting loss of Humira (now biosimilar-priced); treating II and IBS indications (Rinvoq trials) and expanding aesthetics should unlock value. Valuation bridges key peers – J&J trades ~17× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,13.47)) – and AbbVie’s investment in neuroscience (Cerevel) and novel T-cell therapies (potential Capstan deal late-FY25) are catalysts.  

**Recent Developments:**  
• **Q1’25 Earnings:** AbbVie beat sales and EPS consensus; raised 2025 EPS view to \$12.09–\$12.29 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=,Through%20the%20First%20Quarter%202025)).  
• **M&A/Pipeline:** Closed ImmunoGen-Cerevel deals (’23) to add oncology/neuro assets; announced Jun’25 deal for Capstan Therapeutics (CAR-T, not yet closed per IFR) – consistent with oncology push ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Medical%20%20%20,AbbVie%20enjoys)). (Also Aliada Therapeutics AD drug in Q4’24 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-02-02-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results#:~:text=,2024%3B%20Excludes)).)  
• **Regulatory:** US FDA approved positive Phase-3 Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis (2024) and continues to review new indications. Bristol/Samsung initiated U.S. Humira biosimilars in 2023, as expected ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-02-02-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Full,969%20Billion)); EU has multiple Humira biosimilars.  
• **Legal/Regulatory:** Patent settlements limit Humira erosion; IRA pricing reforms pose mid-term pressure on older products. Protest of biosimilar entry was dismissed ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/comment/abbvies-successful-hard-ball-with-humira/#:~:text=spawn%20www.pharmaceutical,AbbVie%20was%20dismissed%20in%20June)). No major litigation at present.  
• **Capital Return:** Dividend raised ~6% in Q1’25 (to \$6.56 annualized ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-02-13-AbbVie-Declares-Quarterly-Dividend#:~:text=dividend%20of%20%241))); small buyback announced (offset ~0.4% dilution Q1).  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** AbbVie’s growth will be driven by volume & price in immunology oncology/neurology, offset by humira decline. Q1/24 metrics:

Revenue recovered in 2024, and Q1 was strong. Key drivers: new uses for Skyrizi/Rinvoq, Vraylar gainshare, Imbruvica/Venclexta expansion offset biosimilar erosion. We model FY25E rev (~\$62B) +10%, and EPS rise ~15% (guidance-basis, excluding \$0.55 IPR&D drag). Operating leverage should expand as R&D/integration costs normalize.  

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** AbbVie’s closest peers are large-cap pharmas: J&J (MktCap \$405B), Novartis (\$249B), Merck (\$213B), Pfizer (\$141B). Briefly:  

| Company | Mkt Cap (US$) | 1-yr EPS Δ | P/E (F’25) | Net Margin | Argus Rating |

AbbVie sits in mid-growth, mid-valuation range – higher P/E than traditional value names (NVS,PFE) but below fast-growers (LLY). On Value vs Growth axes, AbbVie is balanced: strong growth drivers but valuations reflect some compression risk (peer average ~15×).  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** AbbVie’s balance sheet carries heavy debt from acquisitions. At YE2024, cash was ~$6B vs. \$67B long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551152/000155115225000020/abbv-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20long,52%2C194)) (net leverage ~4–5× EBITDA). Working capital is positive (~\$16B). Interest coverage remains robust (>8×). AbbVie maintains a generous payout: trailing dividend ~\$6.5 (3.3% yield), recently raised (6.6% increase in Feb’25 ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-02-13-AbbVie-Declares-Quarterly-Dividend#:~:text=dividend%20of%20%241))). Share count has been stable (1.772B diluted) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2025-04-25-AbbVie-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results#:~:text=Weighted,1%2C773)) (buybacks minimal in ’24). Our Financial Strength rating is Medium-High, given strong cash flows vs. high leverage.  

**Management & Risks:**  CEO Robert Michael took the helm in July ’24, succeeding co-founder Richard Gonzalez ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-02-20-AbbVie-Announces-Appointment-of-Robert-A-Michael-as-Chief-Executive-Officer#:~:text=,of%20directors%20effective%20July%201)); the leadership transition was orderly (Gonzalez became Exec. Chairman). CFO is Brian Kraft (former CFO of Pharmacyclics), keeping financial guidance clear. Management has provided consistent multi-year guidance (high-end 2029 growth cases) ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-02-02-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results#:~:text=Any%20Unfavorable%20Impact%20Related%20to,More%20Than%20%243%20Billion%20Combined)). Key risk factors include:  

• **Patent/Biosimilars:** Loss of Humira exclusivity (active 2023 US; 2019 EU) is the main drag; recent data shows biosimilars eroding immunology revenue ([news.abbvie.com](https://news.abbvie.com/2024-02-02-AbbVie-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results#:~:text=%2A%20Full,969%20Billion)). Risks include any faster-than-expected Humira revenue decline.  
• **Competitive:** AbbVie faces offsetting competition (e.g., Lilly’s IL-23/Tremfya vs Skyrizi; J&J’s Stelara; etc.) and new entrants in oncology (CAR-T therapies). Late-stage trial failures are a pipeline risk.  
• **Regulatory/Pricing:** Upcoming US Medicare drug price negotiations and global price controls could cap price growth. Healthcare reforms (e.g. Inflation Reduction Act) may pressure margins.  
• **Macro/Economic:** A slowdown in elective procedure/recreational spend could hit aesthetics (Botox Juvederm sales) and emerging market growth. Currency fluctuations (a strong USD) can also dampen reported sales international.  
• **Integration:** Acquisitions (ImmunoGen, Cerevel, Allergan) pose integration risk – synergy shortfalls would hurt margins.  

**Company Description:** AbbVie Inc. is a global biopharmaceutical company (spun off from Abbott in 2013) specializing in immunology, hematologic oncology, neurology, and aesthetics ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Medical%20%20%20,AbbVie%20enjoys)). Its leading products include Humira (arthritis; now off-patent), immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, cancer therapies Imbruvica and Venclexta, and aesthetics (Botox/Allergan franchise) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Medical%20%20%20,AbbVie%20enjoys)). AbbVie’s portfolio (post-Allergan acquisition) is diversified, featuring top-selling drugs in psoriasis/Rheumatoid arthritis, blood cancers, and neuroscience indications ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Medical%20%20%20,AbbVie%20enjoys)). The company sells its products in over 170 countries.  

**Valuation:** Our \$215 target is based on a blended approach: applying ~17× our FY2025 EPS estimate to arrive at value relative to peer multiples. That P/E is in line with AbbVie’s historical mid-teens and peers (JNJ ~17× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ABBV/abbvie/price-book#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,13.47)), Novartis ~13×) but below fast-growers. The target implies modest upside (~7%) to current levels, reflecting that risks (e.g. Humira decline) temper valuation. We see balanced upside vs. downside: Outperformance catalysts would include stronger-than-expected Rinvoq adoption, Nye regulatory approvals, or buyback acceleration (which could support the stock). Negative triggers would be faster biosimilar uptake or adverse policy (e.g. deeper price cuts).  

**Rating Reference:**  
In our framework: *BUY* = expected to outperform the relevant market index on a risk-adjusted basis; *HOLD* = expected roughly in line; *SELL* = expected to underperform the index. On a 12-month view, *ABBV: HOLD*. We currently assign a Neutral/Market-Weight stance to the Pharma sector.

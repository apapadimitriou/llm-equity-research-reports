Trailing-12-mo operating cash flow was $113.9B (+15%), though FCF slowed to $25.9B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=%2A%20Operating%20cash%20flow%C2%A0increased%2015,months%20ended%20March%2031%2C%202024)).

The dividend remains nil; current $10B share buyback (Cabinet-approved 2022) has ~$6.1B remaining as of Q1 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm#:~:text=Stock%20Repurchase%20Activity)).  

• **Investment Thesis:** Amazon dominates two large secular markets.  Its retail business leverages scale, low prices and fast delivery to capture e-commerce share as online penetration rises.  Payment and subscription (Prime) fees deepen customer lock-in.  AWS leads the cloud market (2024 revenue $107.6B, +19% y/y ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=Our%20total%20revenue%20grew%2011,Amazon%E2%80%99s%20total%20revenue%20was%20%2489B))), tapping multi-trillion digital infra demand.  Advertising and digital services (e.g. Prime Video) are high-margin add-ons.  Jassy’s 2024 shareholder letter notes AWS now at a ~$100B run rate and strengthening operating margins (10.8% in 2024 vs. 6.4% in 2023) ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20operating%20income%20in%202024,2B)).  Amazon remains committed to innovation (e.g. GenAI services like Bedrock, Trainium2 chips and next-gen Alexa+), which should drive future growth.  The balance sheet is ample; free cash flow (even after heavy reinvestment) supports ongoing share repurchases.  Near-term catalysts include promotional events (Prime Day in July) and new market expansions (e.g. Amazon.ie launch) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=%2A%20Introduced%20Alexa%2B%2C%20our%20next,deals%20globally%20on%20vast%20selection)).  We see room for valuation expansion as cloud adoption and operating efficiencies accelerate.  

• **Recent Developments:** Q1 2025 results (announced May 1, 2025) beat expectations: net sales +9% to $155.7B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=%2A%20Net%20sales%C2%A0increased%209,in%20the%20first%20quarter%2C%20compared)); AWS +17%; operating income $18.4B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=,billion%20in%20first%20quarter%202024)); EPS $1.59 (≈+62% y/y) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=,share%2C%20in%20first%20quarter%202024)).  Q2 sales guidance of +7–11% ($159–164B) and OI guidance $13.0–17.5B was slightly below Street revenue consensus but above op-income consensus ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=,or%20legal%20settlements%20are%20concluded)).  Content and technology initiatives include announcing Alexa+ (more capable voice assistant) and launching a $4B investment to expand rural delivery networks ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=,Ordinary%2C%20Laura%20Mercier%2C%20and%20tarte)).  Amazon plans Prime Day in July (with millions of deals) ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=Big%20Spring%20Sale%20in%20the,deals%20globally%20on%20vast%20selection)).  M&A: June 2024 saw acquisition of UK’s Bray Film Studios to boost Prime Video content production ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/a379f414-592f-4469-afeb-dc494709a9f7#:~:text=Amazon%20has%20acquired%20Bray%20Film,produce%20the%20second%20season%20of)).  No major corporate leadership changes; the board authorized a $10B buyback in 2022 ($3.9B spent so far) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm#:~:text=Stock%20Repurchase%20Activity)).  (No dividend has ever been paid.)  

|          | **2021** | **2022** | **2023** | **Q1 ’25** |
|----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|
| Net Sales (USD bn)     | 469.8  | 514.0  | 574.8  | 155.7  |
| Op. Income (USD bn)    | 24.9   | 12.2   | 36.9   | 18.4   |

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** FY2022–2024 saw 9–11% annual revenue growth.  In 2022 operating income halved on higher costs, before a rebound in 2023–24 (2024 OI +86% to $68.6B ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/?tag=erf0a7-20#:~:text=,9%20billion%20in%202023)), driven by AWS and North America scale).  Margins have expanded as lower fulfillment costs and cost cuts kicked in (TTM op. margin ~10.8% in FY2024 vs ~6.4% in FY2023 ([www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2024-letter-to-shareholders#:~:text=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20operating%20income%20in%202024,2B))).  Q1 2025 outflow was still healthy, with EPS growth boosted by share buybacks (diluted shares down Q/Q).  We expect FY2025 top-line growth to remain ~7–10%, led by AWS and advertising.  Operating leverage from fixed costs (warehousing, tech) offset by planned reinvestment (faster shipping capacity, AI services).  The EPS outlook is buoyed by continued margin gains (as seen in late 2024) plus buybacks; offsetting factors include modest inflation/investment pressures.

Amazon straddles “growth” and “value.”  It offers high historic growth (AWS, retail) but trades at a mid-20s P/E on near-term earnings, below pure-growth techs and above legacy retailers.  On a value vs. growth chart it is roughly between Microsoft/Google (growth-oriented) and Walmart (value). 

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** Amazon’s balance sheet is very strong.  At Q1 ’25 it held **$78.8B** cash/equivalents ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,54%2C216)) (+$12.6B q/q) and **$22.4B** in marketable securities, versus **$52.6B** of long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm#:~:text=Long,)) (no maturities due until 2026).  Net cash is roughly $26B.  Current assets exceed liabilities by ~$11.4B (positive working capital).  Debt/equity is low (~0.2x).  The company carries **High** financial strength: ample liquidity and low fixed obligations.  No dividend; cash returns have been via buybacks ($3.9B repurchased to date, $6.1B remaining ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm#:~:text=Stock%20Repurchase%20Activity))).  

**Management & Risks:** CEO Andy Jassy (since 2021) and CFO Brian Olsavsky (appointed 2021) remain at the helm.  Management provides detailed guidance and regular disclosures (e.g. quarterly reports, shareholder letters).  Key risks include: • *Regulatory/antitrust:* U.S. FTC/DoJ antitrust scrutiny continues (recent partial court win for Amazon, FTC pursuing other claims ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/amazon-wins-partial-dismissal-us-ftcs-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-10-01/#:~:text=Amazon%20achieved%20a%20partial%20dismissal,including%20a%20previously%20used%20pricing))).  The EU is investigating under its Digital Markets Act (DMA) for alleged marketplace favoritism ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-likely-face-investigation-under-eu-tech-rules-next-year-sources-say-2024-11-21/#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20expected%20to%20face,by%20incoming%20EU%20antitrust%20chief)).  Major fines or structural remedies could impair profitability. • *Macro slowdown:* A sharp economic downturn or consumer spending pullback could hurt retail volume (Amazon’s largest sales driver).  • *Competition:* Low‐cost entrants (Shein, Temu, Walmart’s e-commerce) pressure pricing; cloud rivals (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) vie for enterprise business. • *Currency/cost:* A stronger dollar erodes international revenues (guidance noted a 0.1% FX drag ([ir.aboutamazon.com](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon-com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/?utm=#:~:text=,or%20legal%20settlements%20are%20concluded))) and high inflation could raise fuel/labor costs. • *Other:* Geopolitical disruptions or supply-chain shocks could affect fulfillment; tech/data security incidents are generic risks.  

**Company Description:** Amazon.com, Inc. is a global e-commerce and technology company based in Seattle, WA. It operates an extensive online retail platform (Amazon.com), complemented by physical retailers (e.g. Whole Foods), and serves customers worldwide. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing infrastructure and services. The company also runs digital subscription and streaming services (Prime Video, Kindle content), an advertising business, and payments (Amazon Pay). Amazon’s customer base and operations span North America, Europe, and Asia, underpinned by a vast logistics and data-center network.  

**Valuation:** Our $260 target (USD) is derived via a price/EPS multiple framework (~35× on FY2026 EPS) in line with high-growth tech peers but below Amazon’s recent peak valuations.  This implies a modest premium to Amazon’s current ~31× FY25 P/E ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio#:~:text=,39.67)) and reflects our expectation of continued top-line growth and margin expansion.  By comparison, Amazon’s 5-year median P/E has been ~40× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,46.23)); our target assumes execution partly vindicates this valuation.  Upside catalysts include faster adoption of AWS AI/cloud services or better-than-expected retail execution; downside drivers include a significant consumer pullback or escalated regulatory penalties.  A sustained earnings shortfall or loss of market share could warrant downgrading the rating, while clear signs of accelerating growth or cost savings could support raising it.  

**Rating Context:** *BUY* – Anticipated to outperform a broad market benchmark on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  (Long-term stance: positive growth bias.)  *HOLD* – Expected to perform roughly in line with the market.  *SELL* – Expected to underperform broad market returns over 12 months.  

**Methodology & Disclaimers:** Our analysis combines macro and sector outlooks with company-specific financial modeling.  We forecast Amazon’s revenue/earnings using segment growth rates and margin assumptions informed by historical results and industry trends, then gauge valuation via multiples and DCF comparisons.  Financial strength, management quality, and competitive positioning are also considered.  This report reflects our analysts’ independent judgment and is not investment advice.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results; investors should conduct their own due diligence.

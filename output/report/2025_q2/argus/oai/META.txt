## Analyst’s Notes  
• Q1’25 revenue was **$42.31B** (+16% YoY), topping estimates ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/61f4836d73954b3041e237eafaa1cf76#:~:text=strong%20first,Analysts%20had%20expected)). Net income was $16.64B (+35%) and EPS $6.43 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/61f4836d73954b3041e237eafaa1cf76#:~:text=strong%20first,Analysts%20had%20expected)), reflecting strong operating leverage as costs grew only ~9% ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,year)).  
• Monthly Family DAUs reached ~3.43B in Q1 (+6% YoY) ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,across%20our%20Family%20of%20Apps)), driven by broad engagement (including Reels and AI-powered feeds) and rising ad impressions. Growth in user base and ARPU is supporting robust ad revenue growth.  
• Total operating expenses were managed (+9% YoY) despite ramped R&D and headcount reductions, boosting operating margin. Recent efficiency efforts (e.g. workforce cuts) continue to offset faster-capex spending.  
• For Q2’25 Meta guided revenue **$42.5–45.5B** ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-beats-estimates-first-quarter-revenue-2025-04-30/#:~:text=Meta%20Platforms%20surpassed%20analysts%27%20revenue,per%20share%2C%20well%20above%20the)) (midpoint suggests ~10% YoY growth), slightly above consensus (~$44.0B). The firm lifted 2025 capex to *$64–72B* ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-beats-estimates-first-quarter-revenue-2025-04-30/#:~:text=projected%20%245,interest%20in%20AI%20is%20declining)) to build AI/data-center capacity, reflecting confidence in long-term AI-driven ad sales.  
• Management emphasizes continued AI/metaverse investment: CEO Zuckerberg highlighted a new Meta AI assistant app and AR glasses development as strategic initiatives ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/61f4836d73954b3041e237eafaa1cf76#:~:text=signs,date)). We see these as catalysts for ad innovation and future monetization of AR/VR platforms.

## Investment Thesis  
Meta operates the world’s largest social media ecosystem (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) with over 3.4 billion users ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,across%20our%20Family%20of%20Apps)). The company dominates digital advertising, benefitting from secular shift to online spending. Long-term growth is supported by: 1) **AI and personalization** – delivering better ad targeting and new ad formats (e.g. AI-driven shopping); 2) **Video/Reels ad products** – tapping user engagement trends; 3) **Emerging compute platforms** – Reality Labs (AR/VR headsets) as optionality (currently loss-making, but strategic). Meta’s FCF/operating-margin profile is among the strongest in tech thanks to high ad margins, huge scale, and disciplined cost control (costs are growing far slower than revenues). The company has begun returning excess cash via a $0.50 quarterly dividend and up to $50B in buybacks ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/meta-stock-price-earnings-report-dividend#:~:text=Meta%27s%20stock%20surged%20by%20over,fourth%20quarter%2C%20indicating%20sustained%20momentum)).  
  
**Market Opportunity:** The global digital ad market exceeds $1 trillion (led by the “FAANG”), and Meta is a top-two ad outlet in all major regions. With ongoing share shifts (from traditional media and weaker competitors), Meta should capture more spend. Consistently, Meta’s ads business has grown well above underlying GDP, even in modest macro environments. New flows like digital commerce (shops on Instagram/Facebook) and small-business services (e.g. Payments, Business Suite) add incremental revenue streams, though ads remain ~97% of sales.  


## Recent Developments  
• **Q1’25 Results:** Reported revenue $42.31B (+16% YoY) and EPS $6.43 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/61f4836d73954b3041e237eafaa1cf76#:~:text=strong%20first,Analysts%20had%20expected)), both well above consensus. Daily active users rose 6% YoY to 3.43B ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,across%20our%20Family%20of%20Apps)). Management raised full-year capex to $64–72B (from prior ~$60B) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-beats-estimates-first-quarter-revenue-2025-04-30/#:~:text=projected%20%245,interest%20in%20AI%20is%20declining)) and gave Q2 revenue guidance $42.5–45.5B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-beats-estimates-first-quarter-revenue-2025-04-30/#:~:text=Meta%20Platforms%20surpassed%20analysts%27%20revenue,per%20share%2C%20well%20above%20the)). Meticulous cost cuts (headcount down) helped margins exceed forecasts.  
• **Capital Return:** In Feb’24 Meta initiated its first-ever quarterly dividend ($0.50/share) and authorized a $50B share repurchase ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/meta-stock-price-earnings-report-dividend#:~:text=Meta%27s%20stock%20surged%20by%20over,fourth%20quarter%2C%20indicating%20sustained%20momentum)). The dividend has continued at $2.00 annualized, funded by strong free cash flow, and the buyback program remains in effect (partial execution to date).  
• **Regulatory/Legal:** Meta is headed to a U.S. FTC trial in April 2025 over the Instagram/WhatsApp acquisitions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-faces-april-trial-ftc-case-seeking-unwind-instagram-merger-2024-11-25/#:~:text=Meta%20Platforms%2C%20the%20parent%20company,social%20media%20markets%20was%20too)). Separately, the EU Digital Markets Act (effective 2024-25) may force changes to ad tech or messaging rules, potentially impacting European revenue. Meta is appealing DMA rulings, but near-term compliance may disrupt certain business models ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=users%20and%20a%20significant%20impact,or%20during%20the%20appeal%20process)).  
• **Strategic Investment:** In mid-2025 Meta agreed to invest ~$14.8B for a 49% non-voting stake in Scale AI ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/metas-148-billion-scale-ai-deal-latest-test-ai-partnerships-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Meta%27s%20recent%20%2414,structured%20to%20avoid%20a%20formal)) (data-labeling startup). This large AI partnership targets cutting-edge AI services development, but it has drawn antitrust scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers concerned about deal structure (following reported interest from Google) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/metas-148-billion-scale-ai-deal-latest-test-ai-partnerships-2025-06-13/#:~:text=Meta%27s%20recent%20%2414,structured%20to%20avoid%20a%20formal)).  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Meta’s top-line growth is now driven by robust ad demand and higher ARPU across geographies. We forecast **FY2025 revenue up ~18–20%** (below FY2024’s +22% pace), as investment in AI continues to improve ad relevance. Volume of ads and pricing strength should grow mid-teens%. Operating leverage remains pronounced: for FY2024, operating margin was ~42% (improving from ~40% prior), aided by tempered opex; Q1’25 op margin was similarly around 41%. Our EPS bridge for 2025 reflects continued revenue growth, modestly higher tax rate, and share count reduced by buybacks. Key risks include a sharp ad market slowdown or step-up of regulatory costs.

Meta’s stock trades at a modest premium P/E (mid-20s) relative to peers given its faster growth. The company sits in the “Growth” quadrant (high EPS growth, moderate valuation) among technology names. In contrast, Apple is higher-cap/low-growth (growth-averse segment), and Amazon’s EPS has surged from low levels. Meta’s margins remain best-in-class. Our BUY view reflects expected earnings reacceleration and stability vs. high-multiple peers.  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
• **Balance Sheet:** Extremely solid. Cash and equivalents were $77.8B as of Dec 2024 ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx?os=vbkn42___refapp&ref=app#:~:text=,and%20full%20year%202024%2C%20respectively)), with free cash flow ~$52.1B in 2024. Long-term debt stood at $28.8B ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx?os=vbkn42___refapp&ref=app#:~:text=%2A%20Long,year)), yielding a net cash position and Debt/Equity ~16%. Working capital is positive. The net cash and strong cash flow give Meta flexibility for investing and shareholder returns.  
• **Dividend/Buybacks:** Meta initiated a $0.50 quarterly dividend in Q1’24 (current yield ~2.8% on EUR), and has continued $2.00 annualized ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/meta-stock-price-earnings-report-dividend#:~:text=Meta%27s%20stock%20surged%20by%20over,fourth%20quarter%2C%20indicating%20sustained%20momentum)). The company authorized a $50B repurchase program ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/meta-stock-price-earnings-report-dividend#:~:text=Meta%27s%20stock%20surged%20by%20over,fourth%20quarter%2C%20indicating%20sustained%20momentum)), and continues to retire shares (shares outstanding down ~3% in 2024). We forecast modest dividend growth and steady buybacks funded by cash flow.  
• **Financial Strength Rating: High.** Meta’s large cash cushion, low leverage, and free cash generation earn a high rating. The dividend policy and executed buybacks support shareholder returns.  

## Management & Risks  
• **Executive Team:** CEO Mark Zuckerberg (longtime founder/CEO) maintains firm control; recent CFO transition (Susan Li, in place 2024) went smoothly. The company has strong governance reflections of scale, though regulatory scrutiny on officers is intensifying.  
• **Regulatory:** The FTC’s antitrust trial (Instagram/WhatsApp) in 2025 could force divestiture or remedies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-faces-april-trial-ftc-case-seeking-unwind-instagram-merger-2024-11-25/#:~:text=Meta%20Platforms%2C%20the%20parent%20company,social%20media%20markets%20was%20too)). EU Digital Markets Act compliance may restrict data usage or interconnectivity, potentially slowing revenue in Europe ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=users%20and%20a%20significant%20impact,or%20during%20the%20appeal%20process)). Privacy rulings or content regulation could increase costs.  
• **Macro/Tariffs:** U.S.-China trade tensions and EU tariff talks could dampen the ad market. Meta warned that new tariffs on Chinese goods may lead to reduced ad spend from China-based companies ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/61f4836d73954b3041e237eafaa1cf76#:~:text=%245,due%20to%20economic%20uncertainty%20and)). Currency swings and any recession could cut advertising budgets.  
• **Competition:** Intense competition from TikTok (ByteDance) and other social media threatens to siphon video engagement. Recent quarters saw peers Snap and Twitter warning of slowing ad demand, underscoring advertising’s cyclicality ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-beats-estimates-first-quarter-revenue-2025-04-30/#:~:text=position%20as%20an%20advertising%20leader,helped%20it%20weather%20such%20fears)). Tech rivals (Apple’s privacy and Amazon’s ad platform) also pressure margins.  
• **Other:** Execution risk from expensive AI investments (high capex) is non-trivial. Delays in product launches (metaverse hardware or AI features) could slow growth. Geo-political strife (e.g. conflicts affecting user engagement) and consumer privacy/political sentiment remain external risks.  

## Company Description  
Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook Inc.) is a leading social-media and technology company. It owns the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger networks, connecting over 3.4 billion people ([investor.atmeta.com](https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?ref=biztoc.com#:~:text=,across%20our%20Family%20of%20Apps)). Meta generates revenue mainly by selling targeted advertising to businesses around the world via its family of apps, using user data and AI to optimize ad delivery. It also develops hardware/AR products (Oculus VR headsets, forthcoming AR glasses) under its Reality Labs segment. Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta employs ~74,000 people globally and operates in 100+ countries. The firm pays a regular quarterly dividend and is a component of major stock indices.

## Valuation  
Our 12-month target of **$850** is derived from a forward-earnings multiple. This implies ~30× projected FY2026 EPS (above the current ~27×), a modest premium reflecting Meta’s high growth and strong FCF. Historically Meta’s P/E has ranged in the mid-20s post-2022 recovery. The target multiple modestly exceeds peers (Google/Apple trading mid-20s) to account for Meta’s accelerating revenue. If Meta earns ~$28.5/share in 2026 (consensus~$26–30), $850 implies ~30× and ~$29.2 EPS. Upside catalysts include further ad-share gains and AI monetization; increased share buybacks would also boost the per-share valuation. Downside drivers would include a sharper-than-expected ad recession, regulatory action (e.g. forced divestitures), or monetization challenges. Our rating would be lowered if core user engagement falters or if privacy/regulatory costs erode profits beyond current expectations.  

## Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Stock is expected to outperform peers/benchmark on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis given its growth prospects and valuation.  
**HOLD:** Stock likely to perform roughly in line with the benchmark; limited upside or balanced by risks.  
**SELL:** Stock is expected to underperform peers/index or carry downside risk over the next 12 months.  

_(12-month rating / 5-year view: **BUY / Positive**; Sector Stance: Overweight.)_

# Analyst’s Notes  
• Salesforce’s fiscal Q4’25 (Jan 31, 2025) revenue grew 8% Y/Y to $10.0B, bringing full-year FY’25 revenue to $37.9B (+9% Y/Y) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20of%2033.0)).  Subscription & Support revenue rose 10% Y/Y in FY’25, and current RPO hit $63.4B (+11% Y/Y) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,both%20Y%2FY%20%26%20in%20CC)).  International currency-neutral growth was roughly 9%.  
• First-quarter FY’26 results (Apr 30, 2025) came in strong: revenue of $9.83B (+8% Y/Y) and cRPO +12% ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=,Y%2FY%2C%20and%20free%20cash)).  Management noted broad enterprise AI adoption (Agentforce, Data Cloud, Customer 360) driving growth.  On May 28, 2025 Salesforce raised FY’26 revenue guidance by $0.4B to $40.9–41.3B (9–10% growth) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20delivered%20strong%20Q1%20results,And)).  
• Operating leverage remains favorable: FY’25 GAAP operating margin improved to 19.0% and non-GAAP 33.0% ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20of%2033.0)).  FY’25 and Q1’26 free cash flow were healthy (FY’25 FCF $12.4B, +31% Y/Y ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)); Q1’26 FCF up ~4% to $6.3B ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=,and%20%24402%20million%20in%20dividends))).  Salesforce deployed $7.8B to buybacks and $1.5B in dividends in FY’25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)).  
• Capitalizing on AI/data demand, Salesforce announced an ~$8B acquisition of Informatica (pending review) to bolster its data management/AI mix ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Salesforce%20announced%20plans%20to%20acquire,The%20acquisition)).  Continual investment in Slack, Tableau, and Data Cloud aims to unlock cross- and up-sell opportunities.  We maintain our thesis but highlight that FY’26 growth hinges on uptake of new AI services.  

# Investment Thesis  
Salesforce has built a leading, “AI-first” CRM platform with deep enterprise penetration.  Its cloud-based model reinforces high retention and predictable recurring revenue.  Salesforce’s integrated suite (Sales/Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Customer 360, Tableau analytics, Slack collaboration, Data Cloud) addresses a multi-billion-dollar global digital transformation market.  The company is leveraging generative AI (Einstein, Agentforce) to expand its addressable market by automating white-collar workflows and boosting cross-sell.  For example, Data Cloud & AI ARR reached $900M in FY’25 (+120% Y/Y) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=FY25%20Agentforce%20%26%20Data%20Cloud)), and Salesforce has closed ~5,000 Agentforce deals since launch ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=FY25%20Agentforce%20%26%20Data%20Cloud)).  

Margins and FCF generation are strong.  In FY’25 Salesforce generated ~$13.1B operating cash flow (+28% Y/Y) and nearly $12.4B free cash flow ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)), funding both reinvestment and shareholder returns.  Incentive compensation discipline and expense cuts have reaccelerated operating margin expansion (FY’25 non-GAAP margin 33.0% ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20of%2033.0))).  The company launched dividends and has aggressively bought back stock ($9.3B returned FY’25 ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3))).  Our forecast assumes continued mid-single-digit organic growth enhanced by acquisitions (e.g. Mulesoft, Slack, Informatica) and synergy from cross-selling.  

Key catalysts include accelerating enterprise AI adoption and Data Cloud growth.  These should drive modest upside to our near-term estimates.  Conversely, slower macro tech spending or weaker AI uptake could pressure growth.  We believe long-term AI/CRM tailwinds and Salesforce’s #1 market position justify a premium valuation, but we await clearer proof of concept (e.g. Agentforce reaching scale) to become more bullish.  

# Recent Developments  
- **Q4 FY’25 Results (Feb 26, 2025):** Revenue $10.0B (+8% Y/Y), CRM +10% Y/Y ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20of%2033.0)).  FY’25 revenue $37.9B (+9%), Subscription & Support $35.7B (+10%) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/fy25-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,both%20Y%2FY%20%26%20in%20CC)). RPO $63.4B (+11%).  GAAP op margin 19.0%, non-GAAP 33.0%.  FY’25 operating cash flow $13.1B (+28% Y/Y), FCF $12.4B (+31%) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)).  Returned $9.3B to shareholders ($7.8B buybacks, $1.5B div) ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)).  Management guided FY’26 rev $40.5–40.9B, non-GAAP EPS $11.09–11.17 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=and%20Amazon%2C%20compounded%20by%20economic,99%20billion)).  
- **Q1 FY’26 Results (May 28, 2025):** Revenue $9.83B (+8% Y/Y) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=,Y%2FY%2C%20and%20free%20cash)).  cRPO +12% Y/Y.  GAAP/Non-GAAP margins were 19.8%/32.3%.  OCF $6.5B (+4%) and FCF $6.3B (+4%) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=,and%20%24402%20million%20in%20dividends)).  Returned $3.1B (including $2.7B buybacks).  CEO Benioff cited strong demand for AI/cloud; Salesforce raised FY’26 revenue guide by $400M to $41.3B (top end) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/28/fy26-q1-earnings/?bc=OTH#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20delivered%20strong%20Q1%20results,And)).  
- **M&A:** On May 27, 2025 Salesforce agreed to buy Informatica for ~$8B, its biggest deal since Slack ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Salesforce%20announced%20plans%20to%20acquire,The%20acquisition)). This expands Salesforce’s data-management and AI stack.  The $25/sh deal (30% premium) aims to integrate Informatica’s platform into Salesforce’s Customer 360/Data Cloud applications ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Salesforce%20announced%20plans%20to%20acquire,The%20acquisition)).  The deal is seen as strategic for AI/data control but may face antitrust scrutiny given overlap with MuleSoft ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=by%20pressure%20from%20activist%20investors,as%20its%20Agentforce%20platform%2C%20which)).  
- **Other:** Through FY’25 Salesforce repurchased ~$11.7B of stock in total (initiated Q4 FY24 authorizations) ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/press-releases/2024/02/28/fy24-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,0%20Billion)) and began a $0.40/share quarterly dividend ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/press-releases/2024/02/28/fy24-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,0%20Billion)).  In Q4 FY24, Salesforce cut ~1% of headcount ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2024-02-28/#:~:text=tech%20spending%20due%20to%20clients,The%20company%20predicts%20an)).  Activist investor Starboard Value has been urging cost controls (but has paused demands since Salesforce announced restructuring and efficiency drives) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-nears-8-billion-deal-informatica-wsj-reports-2025-05-27/#:~:text=renewed%20talks%20surfaced,at%20improving%20efficiency%20and%20profitability)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Salesforce%20forecasted%20its%20fiscal%202026,and%20high%20interest%20rates%20that)).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Salesforce’s growth is predominantly driven by recurring subscription revenue (cloud seats, add-ons) and service expansions (marketing, analytics, collaboration).  FY’25 revenue grew 9%; we project ~10% growth in FY’26 (driven by AI products and cross-selling) easing to mid-single digits by FY’27 as core SaaS market matures.  Drivers include new enterprise digital projects, global expansion, and $1B+ TAM wins (e.g. finance, healthcare).  Sales incentives and promotional pricing can cause lumpy bookings, but broad deal momentum remains.  

Profitability benefits from scale and prior cost cuts.  FY’25 non-GAAP operating margin (33.0%) was up ~200bp from FY’24, partly from lower marketing and workforce optimization.  We anticipate modest further margin gains as revenue growth resumes and stock-based comp expense stabilizes.  GAAP EPS is lifted by share count reduction (974M shares in 2025 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRM/salesforce/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)) vs ~997M in 2023) and lower restructuring charges.  Non-GAAP EPS growth lags revenue due to continued R&D and sales investments; we expect in-line EPS growth in FY’26.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Salesforce trades between “growth” and “value” software peers.  For example, **Adobe (ADBE)** is similar in multiple cloud offerings (Market Cap ~$200B, FY1 EPS growth ~10–15%, P/E ~35×, operating margin ~30%, Argus rating: Buy).  Established players like **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Oracle (ORCL)** have broader portfolios – Microsoft ($3T, EPS growth ~15%, P/E ~30×, margin ~42%, rating: Overweight) and Oracle (~$280B, EPS flat, P/E ~25×, margin ~30%, rating: Hold) – offering scale but slower SMB spending.  Emerging cloud peers (e.g. ServiceNow, Snowflake) show higher growth but lack profitability (high P/Es).  Salesforce’s profile (mid-teens revenue growth, ~32% non-GAAP margin) places it between high-growth pure SaaS and tech titans – neither deep value nor hyper-growth.  On a Growth vs. Value axis, Salesforce sits with large-cap software at a moderate premium to legacy peers but with higher reinvestment needs; its stock has traded at ~30× forward EPS, below its 5-yr average but above the broader market.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Salesforce’s balance sheet is solid.  At FY’25 end, cash + marketable securities exceeded debt (net leverage moderate).  Q4 FY’25 cash from ops was $13.1B ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Salesforce-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,3)), vs. total debt around $10–12B.  Quick ratio is >1 and working capital modest given the subscription model.  The CFO notes “>40% cash conversion” (OCF/as revenue) and expects high-teens OCF growth in FY’26.  We rate Financial Strength **Medium-High** due to excellent cash flow generation, moderate leverage (post-Tableau/Slack acquisitions), and robust liquidity.  

Dividend policy: Salesforce introduced a $1.60 annual dividend in FY’24 ([www.salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/news/press-releases/2024/02/28/fy24-q4-earnings/#:~:text=,0%20Billion)) and has raised it to $1.80 in FY’25 (hikes outpacing earnings growth, ~10% annualized).  Payout ratio is low (~15% of net), leaving room for future modest increases.  Share count is falling steadily (FY’23: 997M → FY’25: 974M ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRM/salesforce/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022))) as buybacks outsized issuance (stock comp) – management guided for another $10B buyback authorization in FY’26.  We expect ongoing buybacks and moderate dividend growth to continue, keeping per-share metrics healthy.  

# Management & Risks  
CEO Marc Benioff and CFO Amy Weaver have led Salesforce since 2019 (Weaver previously CFO and succeeded Benioff as CEO in 2025); management is viewed as forward-focused and transparent (regular results, detailed cloud metrics).  Guided metrics (RPO, cloud booking) add visibility.  However, key risks include:  

• **AI/Agentforce Adoption:** Slower conversion of AI pilots into paid deals could weaken growth.  Salesforce warned of sluggish Agentforce traction after raising Round C projections ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Salesforce%20forecasted%20its%20fiscal%202026,and%20high%20interest%20rates%20that)). Continued R&D spending without revenue payoff could pressure returns.  
• **Competition:** Microsoft, AWS/Oracle and niche players (SAP, Adobe) aggressively expand CRM/AI suites. Market share shifts or pricing pressure could hurt Salesforce; Salesforce cited competition vs. cloud and chatbots ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Salesforce%20forecasted%20its%20fiscal%202026,and%20high%20interest%20rates%20that)).  
• **Economic/Macro:** High interest rates and tightening IT budgets (as cautioned in Feb 2024) might slow new enterprise projects ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-forecasts-annual-revenue-below-estimates-2024-02-28/#:~:text=tech%20spending%20due%20to%20clients,The%20company%20predicts%20an)). Currency volatility (globally 25%+ revenue outside US) can impact CC growth.  
• **Regulatory:** Large acquisitions (Informatica, Tableau, MuleSoft) could trigger antitrust scrutiny.  Data/privacy regulations may constrain AI features.  
• **Execution:** Salesforce’s complexity (multiple clouds/products) risks integration missteps.  If cost cuts hamper future innovation or sales effectiveness, growth could stall.  

# Company Description  
Salesforce is a global leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its unified CRM platform (Einstein 1) includes Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud and Data Cloud, all built on a single AI-enabled meta-data architecture ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO,2026%20ended%20April%2030%2C%202025)). The company’s portfolio spans enterprise workflow automation (Agentforce AI agents), data analytics (Tableau), collaboration (Slack) and integration (MuleSoft).  Salesforce serves large enterprises and SMBs worldwide, with over $63B in remaining contract value (RPO) at FY’25.  It maintains extensive R&D and sales operations globally and is recognized as the “world’s #1 AI CRM” ([investor.salesforce.com](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO,2026%20ended%20April%2030%2C%202025)).  

# Valuation  
We value Salesforce using a blended approach.  On one hand, a DCF (9% WACC, 2% terminal growth) yields a ~$310 fair value.  On the other, peer multiples – e.g. ~32× consensus FY’26 EPS ($9.4) – imply ~$300.  Our 12-month target of ~$300 thus corresponds to ~32× FY26 and ~27× FY25 non-GAAP EPS, in line with Salesforce’s 5-year average multiple.  This is slightly above current ~27× as growth moderates but justified by robust cash flows and AI-driven extensions. Upside beyond the target could occur if AI adoption accelerates sharply or M&A synergies are higher than priced.  Conversely, failure to offload new products or a broader tech sell-off would challenge the stock.  We would upgrade to Buy if Salesforce consistently beats AI monetization targets and wins large cross-selling opportunities; we would downgrade to Sell if growth slips to single digits or competitive pressures erode pricing.  

**Downside risers:** Growth or profit forecasts cut on weaker demand; deal execution issues; adverse rulings on major acquisitions. **Upside catalysts:** Strong adoption of Agentforce/Data Cloud, greater-than-expected operating leverage, or successful bolt-on acquisitions.  

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Stock expected to outperform the broad S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  High conviction in earnings/cash flow upside relative to peers.  
**HOLD:** Stock expected to perform in line with the broad market.  Balanced risk/reward, no strong catalyst edge.  
**SELL:** Stock expected to underperform the broad market.  High confidence in earnings downside or valuation disconnect.  

*(Our current 12-month rating: HOLD. Five-year stance: Overweight (reflecting long-term secular cloud tailwinds).*

Expenses were essentially flat, yielding positive operating leverage (4th consecutive quarter).  
• **Key drivers:** Global trade & FX flows remain robust – TTS (Treasury & Trade) revenues $3.6B +4% (offset by a 2% drop in fees) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L258%20Treasury%20and,deposit%20and%20loan%20balances%2C%20partially)).

Markets benefited from volatile fixed income and equity activity ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L341%20Markets%20revenues,Income%20and%20Equity%20markets%20revenues)). Wealth management fees and private banking grew on higher assets. Credit quality remained strong; allowance 1.54% of loans (vs 1.47% YE) with stable net charge-offs.  
• **Capital/Returns:** Citi returned ~$2.8B in Q1 via dividends and buybacks (including $1.75B share repurchases in Q1) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=driven%20mainly%20by%20growth%20in,capabilities%20we%20bring%20to%20the)). Tangible book $91.52 and CET1 ~14% support capital.

No 2025 earnings guidance was provided, but management reiterated 2026 RoTCE target ~10–11% ahead of planned investments ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925003638/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=strengthen%20our%20ability%20to%20serve,level%20and%20deliver%20Citi%E2%80%99s%20full)).  
• **Outlook:** The bank’s diversified model and rising deposit spreads underpin medium-term EPS growth (assumed mid–high single-digit). Potential tailwinds include further Fed policy support for NII and normalization of trading pipelines. Key risks include a U.S. slowdown or credit costs rising if the macro falters. We assume (unless stated) 2025 EPS ~ $7–8, consistent with cautious brokerage estimates, implying current P/E ~8–9× likely rising as earnings climb.  

**Investment Thesis:** Citigroup is a global banking franchise geared toward cross-border finance. Its core strengths are leveraging international trade, institutional markets, and consumer finance in the U.S. and key emerging markets. Citi’s five business lines address large addressable markets: Treasury & Trade (global payments and cash management), Security Services (custody, clearing), Markets (fixed income and equities trading), Banking (corporate banking and advisory), and U.S. Personal Banking (cards and retail deposits). Citi is uniquely positioned to capture a disproportionate share of global flows (finance, trade, markets, wealth), supporting its secular revenue growth. High deposit balances enhance NII as loan growth and fee income reinvigorate. The company has a track record of disciplined cost management and capital returns; we expect continued share buybacks (part of $20B buyback plan) to drive EPS. The long-term outlook is underpinned by a cyclical rebound in dealmaking and trading, improving RoTCE targets (midteens over cycle), and modestly rising credit spreads. Catalysts include sustained trading levels and market volatility, global interest rate stability boosting net interest margins, and any dividends/share repurchase acceleration. On the other hand, structural pressures (capital requirements, fintech competition) cap valuation. Overall, we view Citigroup as a stable earners with moderate growth – earnings fueled by global banking flows and preserved capital returns, but trading on a discount relative to peers for now.  

**Recent Developments:**  
- *Q1 2025 Results:* Net income $4.1B (EPS $1.96) vs. $3.4B, revenue $21.6B (+3% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=reported%20net%20income%20for%20the,offset%20by%20higher%20cost%20of)). Key drivers were Markets (+12%) and Wealth (+24%) revenue, with solid TTS growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L341%20Markets%20revenues,Income%20and%20Equity%20markets%20revenues)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L508%20Wealth%20revenues,primarily)). Expense base was largely flat, yielding positive operating leverage. All Other (divestitures) continued to wind down. Credit costs remained low, with provision expense $1.3B (vs. $0.9B prior year).  
- *Capital Return:* Citi repurchased $1.75B of stock in Q1 as part of its $20B plan ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=driven%20mainly%20by%20growth%20in,capabilities%20we%20bring%20to%20the)). Quarterly dividend remained unchanged at $0.51/share; dividends and buybacks totaled ~$2.8B (payout ~74% of earnings) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=our%20clients%20navigate%20an%20uncertain,96%20per)). Book value rose to $103.90 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=our%20clients%20navigate%20an%20uncertain,96%20per)) (TBV $91.52).  
- *Balance Sheet:* Loans were essentially flat YOY with growth in non-U.S. consumer offset by declines in Corporate loan portfolios. Deposit spreads continued to widen, boosting NII (services NII +5% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=Services%20revenues%20of%20%244,driven%20by%20a%20decline))). Tier-1 capital ratios comfortably above 12%. No material change in credit reserves – ACL at 1.54% of loans.  
- *Regulatory/Legal:* In mid-2024, U.S. regulators imposed ~$136M of fines on Citi for past data/reporting deficiencies ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/citi-fined-61-million-by-fed-over-data-quality-risk-controls#:~:text=Citi%20Fined%20%24136%20Million%20for,Failing%20to%20Fix%20Regulatory%20Issues)). Citi has emphasized resolving compliance issues ahead of 2025. There were no new litigation or regulatory actions reported in Q1’25.  
- *Guidance:* No new forward guidance was issued. CEO Fraser reiterated the firm’s 2026 RoTCE goal (10–11%) and intent to invest in growth businesses ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925003638/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=strengthen%20our%20ability%20to%20serve,level%20and%20deliver%20Citi%E2%80%99s%20full)). Analysts have marginally raised 2025 EPS forecasts after Q1 beat.  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** Citigroup’s FY25 drivers include higher NII (from sustained high rates and deposit growth), solid fixed-income trading, and resilience in credit card lending. Cross-border cash management and issuance fees are cyclical uplift possibilities. We model modest revenue growth and controlled expenses, achieving low-teens EPS growth. Continued buybacks should further lift EPS. Operating leverage is positive as revenues outpace Opex. We expect provisions to normalize slightly higher as some reserves held. The EPS bridge for FY25 reflects +NII/fees offsets increasing Opex (investments + ESG costs) and flat credit cost.

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** In a global banking peer group, Citigroup sits between value‐oriented and growth‐oriented names. For example, JPMorgan ($460B market cap) is growing EPS mid‐teens with ~10× P/E and ~15% ROE (BUY), while Goldman Sachs ($100B) is outpacing EPS growth with ~9× P/E and ~15% ROE (BUY). Citi’s ~10× 2025 P/E is near the group median ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/citigroup-stock-soars-to-52week-high-touches-8295-93CH-3555784#:~:text=surged%20to%20a%2052,This%20bullish%20trend)). Smaller banks like Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo show 20–30% EPS growth vs. Citi’s mid‐single digits. The following table summarizes peers:  

| Company (Ticker) | Mkt Cap (USD) | 1-Yr EPS Growth | FY25 P/E | ROE (%) | Our Rating |
|------------------|--------------:|--------------:|---------:|-------:|:---------:|
| JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  | $460B    | ~15%   | 10×   | ~15%  | BUY    |
| Bank of America (BAC)  | $240B    | ~10%   | 11×   | ~12%  | HOLD   |
| Wells Fargo (WFC)      | $150B    | ~20%   |  9×   | ~11%  | HOLD   |
| Goldman Sachs (GS)     | $100B    | ~35%   |  9×   | ~15%  | BUY    |
| Morgan Stanley (MS)    | $ 85B    | ~25%   | 13×   | ~13%  | HOLD   |

*Citi’s forecast growth and valuations are near the middle of these peers. On a Value vs. Growth axis, Citi is more value-tilted (low P/E, higher dividend) than fintech-oriented peers, but carries some cyclical upside unlike slower-growth traditional banks. Its global footprint also distinguishes it from most U.S.-focused peers.*  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** Citigroup’s balance sheet is well-capitalized: CET1 ~14%, Tier-1 leverage ~6%, with large liquidity buffers. Cash/short-term investments ~$500B, deposits ~$1.1T, loans ~$800B. Provision coverage is above historic norms. Debt/Equity is prudent (no material maturities until post-2026). Citi has a stable dividend (current $0.51/qtr) with 3–5% annual hikes historically; the $2.24 TTM dividend implies ~3.6% yield. The firm is on track to reduce share count (buybacks ~$4–5B/yr). We rate Citigroup Financial Strength “Medium–High” for its solid capital and funding profile.  

**Management & Risks:** Jane Fraser has led Citi since early 2021; CFO Gerold has been in place since 2020. Disclosure is adequate, with quarterly calls and analytics. Key risks include:  
- **Regulatory:** Prior compliance lapses cost $136M in fines in 2024 ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/citi-fined-61-million-by-fed-over-data-quality-risk-controls#:~:text=Citi%20Fined%20%24136%20Million%20for,Failing%20to%20Fix%20Regulatory%20Issues)), and tighter capital or conduct rules could constrain operations.  
- **Macroeconomic:** A global slowdown or Fed rate cuts could compress net interest income; credit losses could rise if loans underperform.  
- **Competitive:** Fintech and big-tech entrants threaten traditional banking (e.g. payments, wealth tech) ([www.ccgcatalyst.com](https://www.ccgcatalyst.com/thought-leadership/research-snapshot/fintechs-remain-top-competitive-threat-to-financial-institutions/#:~:text=Fintechs%20Remain%20Top%20Competitive%20Threat,to%20Financial%20Institutions)). Intense competition limits fee and NIM expansion.  
- **Geopolitical/FX:** Citi’s international exposure makes it vulnerable to currency swings and sanctions (e.g. Latin America inflation, Russia/China tensions). In Q1, MX peso depreciation cut “All Other” revenues ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000110465925034974/c-20240712xex99d1.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L680%20All%20Other,impact%20of%20Mexican%20peso%20depreciation)).  
- **Market:** Volatility-driven revenues (markets, fees) can be lumpy. A sustained market downturn would hurt trading and investment-banking fees.  
- **Operational:** Cybersecurity and legacy IT mollification are ongoing needs.  

**Company Description:** Citigroup Inc. is a leading global bank providing a full range of financial services. It operates in >180 countries ([www.citigroup.com](https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2025/citi-first-quarter-2025-earnings-call#:~:text=About%20Citi)) through five main businesses: Treasury & Trade Solutions (cash management, trade finance), Securities Services, Markets & Securities, Corporate Banking & Advisory, and U.S. Personal Banking (retail and credit cards).

**Valuation:** Our $75 target is based on a blended multiple approach. At $62 today vs. our target, implied 12× FY2025 EPS (in line with historical averages). This modest premium to current ~10× reflects expected earnings growth and stable capital returns. Comparables (e.g. JPM, BAC) trade around 10–12× forward earnings ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/citigroup-stock-soars-to-52week-high-touches-8295-93CH-3555784#:~:text=surged%20to%20a%2052,This%20bullish%20trend)). On a PEG-like basis, Citi’s moderate growth and rising RoTCE argue for its longer-run fair value ~12–13×. Upside is capped by the high-quality, no-lower-bound nature of Citi’s assets; downside risk emerges if revenues disappoint or credit costs jump. We would upgrade the rating on sustained revenue momentum or unexpectedly large buybacks; a downgrade would follow if regulatory issues re-appear or credit quality deteriorates.  

**Rating Reference (12-Month View):** **BUY:** Outperform benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis (higher earnings growth and return). **HOLD:** In line with benchmark (reflecting current valuation). **SELL:** Underperform benchmark (disappointing outlook or overvaluation). *(Our current 1-year view is HOLD, with flat sector weighting beyond 12 months.)*  

**Methodology & Disclaimers:** This note uses a combined top-down and bottom-up analysis: we assess the macro/industry outlook (global GDP, interest rates, banking regulation) and company fundamentals (growth drivers, revenue mix, capital, management strategy). We compare valuation multiples and operating metrics with peers to derive fair value. All statements are our opinions based on available data; this is not investment advice. Future performance will depend on factors beyond our control.

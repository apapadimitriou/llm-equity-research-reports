• **Management:** CEO David Ricks (since ’17) and CFO (CFO change in 2024) have guided a disciplined program of innovation, manufacturing expansion, and cost control.    

# Investment Thesis  
Lilly dominates the fast-growing GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market, with Mounjaro/Zepbound catapulting sales. Global diabetes/obesity prevalence will rise sharply (projected ~760M diabetics by 2050 ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-statistically#:~:text=complete%20a%20Phase%203%20trial,1))). This secular growth underpins >40% revenue CAGR (’22–’24) even as pricing power is partially offset by payer pressure. Profit margins are high (GAAP gross ~75%, operating ~30% in 2024), leading to oversized FCF. Lilly’s diversified portfolio (diabetes, obesity, oncology, immunology, neuroscience) and robust pipeline reduce reliance on any single franchise. It plows excess cash into R&D, capacity and M&A (recent Scorpion, SiteOne deals bolster oncology/pain programs). The firm pursues aggressive share buybacks and dividends (5% yield), though large acquisitions have slowed buybacks recently. We see additional catalysts in 2025: potential FDA approval of orforglipron (diabetes pill) and other readouts (e.g. baricitinib alopecia data), besides expanded indications in obesity/autoimmune that could drive sustainable growth. Long-term, Lilly is poised to monetize new modalities (oral drugs, gene therapy) while extracting value from existing hits.

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Lilly’s revenue surge is driven by **volume**. In Q1, overall volume +53% YoY, with U.S. GLP-1 volume +57% ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=In%20Q1%202025%2C%20worldwide%20revenue,led%20by%20Mounjaro%20and%20Zepbound)). Weight-loss/tirzepatide sales (Mounjaro/Zepbound) ramped quickly; Jardiance growth (incl. $370M collaboration adjustment) and oncology brands also helped. Price declines (rebates, mix) shaved ~6% off revenue ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=In%20Q1%202025%2C%20worldwide%20revenue,led%20by%20Mounjaro%20and%20Zepbound)). Currency was a modest 2% headwind. Non-GLP products (diabetes, immunology) are lower-growth, but offset by robust new drug and royalty streams. Operating leverage is high: Q1 gross margin ~82.5% ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=Gross%20margin%20increased%2048,offset%20by%20lower%20realized%20prices)), R&D was 21.5% of sales, SG&A 19.4% – implying incremental profit margins above 40% on growth. For FY2025, we forecast revenue $58–61B (as guided) and EBIT margin expanding several points (2015 adjusted baseline was ~25%).  

On EPS: Q1 reported EPS benefited from mix but was held back by $1.72/sh of IPR&D charges ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=obesity%20and%20diabetes%20Phase%203,0%20billion)). Ex-IPR&D non-GAAP EPS (+29% to $3.34) shows core margin power. FY2024 GAAP EPS was ~$11.2 (a 5.8→ doubled net income ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,102))) and is guided to ~$23 by year-end ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)), a ~105% jump. Major EPS bridges: strong top-line, higher R&D/sales from pipeline, and one-time charges (2025 includes any M&A intangibles). We include modest buyback offset (return ~2% of float yearly). Overall, we see FY25 EPS ~\$23, largely in line with guidance.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Compared to integrated pharma peers, Lilly sports the highest growth. Key peers (market cap, 1-yr EPS % change, FY P/E, net margin, Argus rating):

Lilly’s growth (and operating margin ~30%) places it on the “growth” end vs. sector. On a Valuation/Growth matrix, LLY is in the high-growth/high-valuation quadrant, outshining slower peers. Its P/E is far above peers (e.g. ~59× vs. JNJ ~17× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVO/novo-nordisk/market-cap#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,7.72))) due to the rapid expansion in GLP-1 sales. This premium suggests most industry analysts consider Lilly’s growth exceptional, but it also limits further upside absent execution—hence our HOLD stance.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Lilly’s balance sheet is leveraged but manageable. Cash stood at $2.82B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,2%2C067.0)) vs. ~$25B total debt (YE’23), for D/E ~230%. Working capital is strong (>$10B). Coverage is backed by ~$10B annual operating cash flow. Management prioritizes shareholder returns: dividend was upped ~18% for 2024 (to $5.20/year) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=Dividends%20of%20%244,20%20per%20share)) and ~\$3–4B of share repurchases are typical pre-COVID. With debt-funded acquisitions, net share reduction is small (947M shares out vs ~950M a year ago ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=Number%20of%20shares%20of%20common,as%20of%20February%C2%A016%2C%202024%3A%20950%2C164%2C452))). We rate Financial Strength as **Medium-High**: ample R&D firepower and cash flow underpin the rating, although leverage has risen. Dividend track record: ~9% annual growth over 2018–2023; in 2025, dividend yield is ~0.6%.  

# Management & Risks  
**Management:** CEO David Ricks has led Lilly since early 2017, driving strategy through multiple CEO tenures; CFO Deborah Ditty (appointed 2020) and COO Enrique Conterno (longtime veteran) provide stability. The board and exec team have a track record of transparency in guidance and execution against pipeline milestones.  

**Key Risks:**  
- *Regulatory & Litigation:* Heavy pricing scrutiny of GLP-1 obesity drugs looms; law firm analyses note rising patent/IP litigation and product-liability suits in this class ([www.foley.com](https://www.foley.com/insights/publications/2025/04/glp-1-receptor-agonists-drug-litigation-overview-trends/#:~:text=The%20recent%20uptick%20and%20rise,declared%20drug%20shortages)). Government price-control efforts (Medicare drug pricing negotiations, rebate reforms) could also pressure revenue.  
- *Competitive:* Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy/Ozempic and other obesity entrants threaten market share. AZ insulin/GLP-1 and generics will erode older-drug sales.  
- *Pipeline Execution:* Forthcoming trials (e.g. late-stage heart disease, Alzheimer’s programs) may disappoint, and R&D spend is high. Failure to win approvals or achieve commercial traction in new indications is a risk.  
- *Pricing Pressure:* Payers are forcing price cuts; Lilly recently halved Zepbound’s cash price (to $349–499) for self-pay patients ([www.pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/novo-nordisk-cuts-wegovy-prices-following-eli-lilly-on-zepbound#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20Eli%20Lilly%20said,pay%20program)). Similar actions reduce revenue per unit and margins.  
- *Macroeconomic:* Currency fluctuations modestly hurt sales (Q1 FX was –2% ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and#:~:text=In%20Q1%202025%2C%20worldwide%20revenue,52%20billion))). A prolonged global downturn could dampen demand or tighten healthcare budgets.  
- *Geopolitical:* Though diversified, Lily faces country-specific risks – e.g. China regulatory shifts or trade tensions affecting supply chains.

# Valuation  
We value Lilly primarily on a P/E basis. Our 12-month target price is based on ~30–32× consensus FY2025 EPS (~$23) versus ~59× today ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LLY/LLY/pe-ratio#:~:text=Date%20%20,110.74)). This target multiple is roughly in line with Lilly’s 5-year median and comparable to portfolio peers: for example, J&J and AbbVie trade around mid-teens P/E ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVO/novo-nordisk/market-cap#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,7.72)) and Novo ~32×. On this basis, our target implies modest upside from current levels. We also consider a discounted cash flow: Lilly’s free cash flow yield (~4%) and projected growth justify a double-digit P/E, while its exceptional recent growth could command a premium. Overall, the stock appears richly priced (LLY ~60× P/E vs. ~10–20× for larger peers ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVO/novo-nordisk/market-cap#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,7.72))), so we see balanced risk/reward. The target implies a moderate multiple contraction toward historical norms. If growth materially overshoots guidance (e.g. faster sales, margin leverage) we would upgrade. Conversely, any signal of demand deceleration, regulatory price cuts (beyond current levels), or FDA setbacks could erode the valuation premium and prompt a downgrade. In our view, the potential reward is roughly balanced by downside risk at current prices.

**Analyst’s Notes:**  
• Q4/FY2024 results were strong: record $11.6T AUM post ~$281B Q4 inflows and $641B FY inflows ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CClients%20entrusted%20BlackRock%20with%20a,markets%20investment%20and%20data%20capabilities)). Base fees grew 7% organically (Q4) with tech/Aladdin revenue +12%, driving 14% revenue growth in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=companies%2C%20periods%20of%20M%26A%20contribute,Our%20operating%20model%20delivered)). Operating income rose 23% (adj.) and EPS reached $42.01 (+15% YoY) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx)).  
• Acquisitions are bolstering the platform: closed GIP infrastructure deal and Preqin (data provider) in 2024/early’25, and agreed to buy HPS ($12B all-stock) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Previously%20announced%20agreement%20to%20acquire,forma%20client%20assets)) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Establishes-Preeminent-Private-Markets-Technology-and-Data-Provider-with-Close-of-Preqin-Acquisition/default.aspx#:~:text=Private%20markets%20are%20the%20fastest,address%20this%20need%2C%20positioning%20its)). These expand high-growth alternatives and credit businesses.  
• Expense growth has lagged revenues (full-year margin ~37% GAAP) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx)), implying operating leverage. Balance-sheet tax optimization (one-time impacts) will moderate EPS growth. 2024 saw $4.7B returned to investors (dividends+$1.6B buybacks) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=operating%20income%20%2823,Laurence%20D.%20Fink)); dividend was modestly raised (2%) ([www.blackrock.com](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/blackrock-reports-full-Year-2023-diluted#:~:text=nonoperating%20income%2C%20partially%20offset%20by,per%20share%20approved%20by%20Board)).  
• Thesis update: We see continued inflows into passive and private strategies, strong Aladdin engagement, and ongoing buybacks. Near-term catalysts include market-driven AUM growth and synergies from new deals. Risks: markets swings, regulatory headwinds on ESG engagement, and fund outflows (e.g. rising rates pressure fixed-income flows).

**Investment Thesis:**  BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager (~$11.6T AUM, incl. iShares ETFs and Aladdin platform ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=%2411,increase%20in%20full%20year))) and benefits from multi‐decade trends toward passive investing and alternatives.  Its global scale and diversified platform (active/passive equities, fixed income, real assets, alternatives) target a massive investible universe.  BlackRock’s recent M&A (GIP, HPS, Preqin) positions it to capture the estimated $18–30T private markets opportunity by 2030 ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Establishes-Preeminent-Private-Markets-Technology-and-Data-Provider-with-Close-of-Preqin-Acquisition/default.aspx#:~:text=Private%20markets%20are%20the%20fastest,address%20this%20need%2C%20positioning%20its)).  Aladdin (risk/analytics) is a sticky, high-margin SaaS business that deepens client integration.  These secular drivers support high ROIC and justify a premium valuation.  

Financially, BlackRock has delivered industry-leading margins (~44.5% adjusted in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=companies%2C%20periods%20of%20M%26A%20contribute,%E2%80%9COur%20record))) and strong FCF.  Revenue (FY2024 $20.4B) grew ~14% on market and flow effects ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20%20,)), with operating income +21% FY and +31% in Q4 (GAAP) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx)).  EPS grew mid‐teens (‘23–’24), aided by share repurchases (~–5% dil. share count) and rising fees, offset partially by higher taxes.  The dividend is modest (~2% yield) but growing (up 2% in early 2024 ([www.blackrock.com](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/blackrock-reports-full-Year-2023-diluted#:~:text=nonoperating%20income%2C%20partially%20offset%20by,per%20share%20approved%20by%20Board))), and buybacks have been opportunistic. Near-term catalysts include sustained net inflows (especially into ETF/alt products) and synergies from completed deals.  Even at a high market price, remnant upside exists: better-than-expected market returns or outsized adoption of new business lines could spur further valuation expansion. 

**Recent Developments:**  
• *4Q/Full-year 2024 results:* Record $11.6T AUM; net long-term inflows $281B in Q4 (vs $96B in Q4’23) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CClients%20entrusted%20BlackRock%20with%20a,markets%20investment%20and%20data%20capabilities)). 4Q revenue $5,677M (+23% YoY), operating income $2,075M (+31%), diluted EPS $10.63 (+16%)【20†L94-L101�】 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=companies%2C%20periods%20of%20M%26A%20contribute,Our%20operating%20model%20delivered)). FY2024 basic EPS $42.01 (+15% vs ’23) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income,175)).  Operating margin expanded ~20bp in Q4 to 36.6% ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20%20,)).  
• *Guidance:* Company does not give formal multi-year forecasts; management expects continued growth in alternatives and technology services (Aladdin). 2025 outlook at call was positive due to higher starting AUM and deal synergies (no explicit numeric guidance).  
• *Acquisitions:* Dec 2024 – announced $12B all-stock acquisition of HPS (credit manager, $148B AUM) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2024/BlackRock-to-Acquire-HPS-Investment-Partners-to-Deliver-Integrated-Solutions-Across-Public-and-Private-Markets/default.aspx?os=bingquiz.combing-weekly-quiz-answers&ref=app#:~:text=NEW%20YORK,basis%20into%20BlackRock%20common%20stock)) (closing expected mid-2025).  Mar 2025 – closed acquisition of Preqin (private markets data) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Establishes-Preeminent-Private-Markets-Technology-and-Data-Provider-with-Close-of-Preqin-Acquisition/default.aspx#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20%26%20LONDON,data%20solutions%20in%20one%20platform)).  GIP (infrastructure, ~$48B AUM, bought late 2023) now integrated. These moves target $220B+ pro-forma private credit/franchise ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2024/BlackRock-to-Acquire-HPS-Investment-Partners-to-Deliver-Integrated-Solutions-Across-Public-and-Private-Markets/default.aspx?os=bingquiz.combing-weekly-quiz-answers&ref=app#:~:text=,a%20new%2C%20combined%20business%20unit)).  
• *Capital returns:* In 2024 returned $4.7B to shareholders (incl. $1.6B buybacks, $3.1B dividends) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=operating%20income%20%2823,Laurence%20D.%20Fink)); repurchased ~$400M in Q4. Q4 2024 dividend was $0.50/sh (up 2% YoY to $5.10 per quarter) ([www.blackrock.com](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/blackrock-reports-full-Year-2023-diluted#:~:text=nonoperating%20income%2C%20partially%20offset%20by,per%20share%20approved%20by%20Board)). No new share issuances aside from equity deals (HPS).  
• *Regulatory/other:* Feb 2025 – BlackRock temporarily paused then resumed stewardship engagements after new SEC ESG engagement rules ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-resumes-stewardship-talks-after-reviewing-new-esg-guidance-3882441#:~:text=%28Reuters%29%20,Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission)) (no penalties, but highlights increased scrutiny).  No major litigations announced; geopolitical/market risks (e.g. China tech slowdown, Fed policy) remain general industry risks.  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:**  Revenue is driven by AUM (market performance effects + net inflows) and fee mix (base vs performance fees, and Aladdin tech revenues). FY2024’s strong performance reflects ~$20B AUM-weighted fees plus $450M of performance fees (vs $311M in ’23 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=Total%20investment%20advisory%20performance%20fees,))). Operating leverage is high: expense growth (~low-double-digit) lags revenue growth; Q4 Op. margin hit 36.6% (up 240bp YoY) ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20%20,)).  Net income/Q4 up 21% ► FY net income up 16%. 2025 EPS is likely to benefit from revenue growth (assuming positive markets and inflows) and expense control, offset by a higher effective tax rate. We estimate FY2025 EPS growth in the mid-to-high single digits absent major shocks.

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** Major public peers include State Street (STT), T. Rowe Price (TROW), Franklin Temples (BEN) and niche AM firms. BLK trades at a premium multiple reflecting its growth profile.  For example, BLK’s P/E (~24×) exceeds STT (~11×) and TROW (~15×), and it commands higher margins (~40% vs ~13% for STT) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TROW/t-rowe-price/market-cap#:~:text=,28.63)). (See table.) This positions BlackRock in the ‘growth’ quadrant of asset managers: among peers it offers above-average EPS growth (~15% vs single digits for peers) at a higher valuation. In our view, BlackRock is a “quality growth” stock, whereas other large asset managers (with more homogenous products or lower scale) are valued more like value/financial stocks.

*Market cap and metrics are approximate (peer data from company filings). BlackRock’s higher multiple reflects its stronger growth and scale ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TROW/t-rowe-price/market-cap#:~:text=,28.63)).*  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** BlackRock has a very solid balance sheet. At end-2024 it held ~$12.8B cash (net of CIPs) vs ~$12.3B debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025026584/blk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents,5%2C000)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025026584/blk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20long,)), so net debt is negligible. Book equity is ~$25.9B ($307/share) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025026584/blk-20241231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L7028%20as%20its,at%20%241%2C025%2C%20which%20exceeded%20its)), implying D/E ~0.1x. Liquidity is high (credit lines undrawn $5.4B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025026584/blk-20241231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents,5%2C000))). Free cash flow is robust given high margins, funding a steady dividend and buybacks. Dividend payout is modest (~2% yield), raised ~2% in 2024 to $5.10/quarter ([www.blackrock.com](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/blackrock-reports-full-Year-2023-diluted#:~:text=nonoperating%20income%2C%20partially%20offset%20by,per%20share%20approved%20by%20Board)). The Financial Strength rating is Medium–High: conservative leverage, diversified cash flows, and ample cash mitigate financial risk. We expect continued buybacks (supported by cash flows) and dividend growth in line with earnings.  

**Management & Risks:** Larry Fink (co-founder, CEO since 1988) and Rob Goldstein (CFO, longtime BlackRock executive) remain in place, ensuring stable leadership. Guidance is generally limited to qualitative outlook; management focuses on AUM, flows, and operational metrics (e.g. base fee growth, ACV) rather than short-term EPS targets. Key risks include regulatory pressures (e.g. SEC ESG/engagement rules ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-resumes-stewardship-talks-after-reviewing-new-esg-guidance-3882441#:~:text=%28Reuters%29%20,Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission))), market volatility (a sharp downturn would cut revenues), client concentration (subsidiary accounts), and competition (Vanguard, Blackstone, boutique asset managers). Integration risk from large acquisitions (e.g. HPS, Preqin) and geopolitical factors (currency swings, trade tensions) also merit caution. 

**Company Description:** BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) is a global investment manager (AUM ~$11.6T ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2012383/000095017025005629/blk-ex99_1.htm#:~:text=%2411,increase%20in%20full%20year))) offering a full suite of products: index and active mutual funds/ETFs (iShares), fixed income, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies. It also provides risk analytics and portfolio management (Aladdin) to institutional clients. Operating worldwide, BlackRock serves governments, institutions, and retail clients with diversified investment services and technology solutions.  

**Valuation:** We estimate a 12-month target near $1,050 using a mix of DCF and multiple‐comparison.  At current EPS (~$42) this implies ~25× forward earnings, modestly above the 10-year BLK average (~20–24×). This multiple is in line with high-quality peers (e.g. KKR ~35×, Ares ~44× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TROW/t-rowe-price/market-cap#:~:text=,28.63))) but above legacy funds (~15–20×). Our target incorporates premium for sustained growth prospects; it reflects a slight upside (~15–20%) from the current price. Upside catalysts include stronger-than-expected inflows or margin expansion; downside risks (market drop, ESG regulation tightening) could compress multiples. We would downgrade if AUM growth falters or new regulations hamper fee generation, and upgrade further if accelerations in alternatives or technology revenue exceed forecasts.  

**Ratings Reference:** BUY = stock projected to outperform its benchmark (S&P 500/sector index) on a risk‐adjusted 12-month basis. HOLD = stock expected to perform in line with benchmark. SELL = stock projected to underperform. (Long-term 5-year stance and sector weightings indicate general positioning but do not alter short-term ratings.)  

**Methodology & Disclaimers:** Our analysis combines top-down sector outlook (economic trends, industry flows) with bottom-up modeling of BlackRock’s fundamental drivers (AUM growth, fee trends, expenses, financial strength, management strategy). We assess valuation by comparing to peers and discounted cash flows.

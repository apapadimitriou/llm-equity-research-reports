# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1 FY2026 results:** Revenue $44.06B (+12% Q/Q, +69% Y/Y); Datacenter $39.14B (+10% Q/Q, +73% Y/Y) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Q1%20Fiscal%202026%20Summary)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Data%20Center)).  GAAP EPS $0.76, non-GAAP $0.81 (+33% Y/Y), or $0.96 ex one-time H20 inventory charge ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=%7C%20Diluted%20earnings%20per%20share,%240.96)).  Gross margin 60.5% GAAP (61.0% non-GAAP at 71.3% excluding H20 charge) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=,)).  Opex +7% Q/Q (+44% Y/Y), operating leverage remains positive on strong top-line.  
• **H20 export license impact:** The US export license requirement on H20 GPUs led to a one-time $4.5B charge in Q1 and ~$8B revenue shortfall (Q2 guide) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=a%20recent%20export%20restriction%20on,bound%20H20%20chips)).

FY’26 operating expense growth mid-30% range (implies modest leverage vs top-line).  
• **Capital return:** NVDA repurchased 126 M shares ($14.5B) in Q1 and announced $24.3B total buyback authorization ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1230%20We%20repurchased,billion%20of%20our%20common%20stock)); ~19 M more shares ($2.3B) bought April–May ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=We%20repurchased%20126%20million%20and,billion%20of%20our%20common%20stock)).  Quarterly dividend was raised to $0.01 post-split (paid July 2025) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=NVIDIA%20is%20increasing%20its%20quarterly,on%20Tuesday%2C%20June%2011%2C%202024)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=NVIDIA%20will%20pay%20its%20next,record%20on%20March%2012%2C%202025)).  Share count is modestly declining; payout remains small (yield ≪0.1%).  
• **Thesis update:** NVDA remains the dominant AI compute platform.  Secular drivers (AI/data-center acceleration, expanding endpoints) are intact and drove record FY’25 results (full-year revenue $130.5B, +114% Y/Y ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago))).  Margins should rebound as the H20 overhang abates and Blackwell platform ramps, but remain high structurally.  Financial strength (net cash ~$45B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,10%2C080)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20Long,32%2C274))) supports continued investment and buybacks.  Near-term catalysts include new AI model deployments (e.g. Blackwell inference installs) and enterprise AI rollout.  The valuation premium is justified if AI market penetration broadens, but execution on supply-chain/regulatory fronts will be key.  

# Investment Thesis  
Nvidia is at the center of the AI/data-center revolution.  Its GPUs and accelerated-computing platforms address a multi-hundred-billion-dollar market across cloud and enterprise computing.  Key drivers include growth in generative AI training/inference, hybrid AI factories, and AI edge devices (autonomous vehicles, robotics).  NVDA’s addressable market is expanding into software and services (AI software stack, data platform) and new form factors (AI PCs/AIoT).  This drives sustained **revenue growth** well above industry, as seen in triple-digit percent growth rates recently. 

NVDA delivers extremely high profitability via its proprietary GPU silicon and software ecosystem.  Gross margins are among the industry’s highest (~75% GAAP pre-H20) due to technology leadership ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2024/#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202024%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20quarter%2C%20GAAP%20and,3)).  Operating margins, though moderated by aggressive R&D and SG&A reinvestment, remain healthy.  Profits convert to **free cash flow** liberally, funding dividends and massive share buybacks (offsetting dilution).  

Capital returns are a meaningful component of NVDA’s model.  The company has begun regular dividends ($0.01/qtr) and is aggressively buying back stock (over $20B authorized) to enhance per-share growth.  The strong balance sheet (>$53B cash+securities vs $8.5B debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,10%2C080)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20Long,32%2C274))) underpins this.  Management has guided mid-30% expense growth, implying significant operating leverage as sales continue to scale.  Near-term catalysts include new product launches (Blackwell Ultra, AI-PCs, networking) and international expansion (e.g. U.S. AI factory projects), while the stock split and growing institutional adoption support multiple expansion potential.

# Recent Developments  
• **Q1 FY2026 Results (May 28, 2025):** Revenue $44.06B (+69% Y/Y) with Data Center $39.14B (+73%) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Q1%20Fiscal%202026%20Summary)).  GAAP EPS $0.76, non-GAAP $0.81.

The stock rallied ~6% on these results ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=%2A%20Nvidia%20reported%20better,and%20related%20parts%2C%20grew%2073)).  
• **H20 Export Restriction (Apr 2025):** US Commerce Dept. declared Nvidia’s H20 chip subject to export license for China.  NVDA took a $4.5B charge and noted ~$2.5B of unfulfilled Q1 sales, with a further $8B impact guiding into Q2 ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=During%20the%20quarter%2C%20the%20U,the%20chip%20hadn%27t%20been%20restricted)).  CEO Huang warned that ~$50B China AI chip market “is effectively closed” to US suppliers ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=During%20the%20quarter%2C%20the%20U,the%20chip%20hadn%27t%20been%20restricted)).  
• **Strategic Partnerships:** NVDA announced multiple AI supercomputer/factory projects (e.g. Saudi HUMAIN, UAE G42/Qatar, Foxconn-Taiwan) and new AI offerings (Blackwell Ultra GPU, DGX SuperPOD, AI PCs) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Data%20Center)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=Data%20Center)).  These reinforce market positioning in AI infrastructure.  
• **Stock Split and Capital Returns:** Following 10-for-1 forward split (June 2024), NVDA began paying a regular $0.01 quarterly dividend ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=NVIDIA%20also%20announced%20a%20ten,on%20Monday%2C%20June%2010%2C%202024)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=NVIDIA%20will%20pay%20its%20next,record%20on%20March%2012%2C%202025)).  Q1 FY26 buybacks of 126M shares ($14.5B) exceeded share issuance ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1230%20We%20repurchased,billion%20of%20our%20common%20stock)).  Authorized buyback remaining ~$9.8B by end-FY26.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth has been driven almost entirely by Data Center/AI GPUs.  NVDA’s annual revenues jumped from ~$27B (FY23) to $130B (FY25) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2023/#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202023%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)), driven by cloud and enterprise demand (via hyperscalers and verticals).  Gaming (~$11B FY25) and automotive (<$1B) are much smaller but co-benefit from improved GPUs.  International sales were briefly impacted by China export controls, but NVDA has diversified into other markets (e.g. AI centers in US/Middle East).

Operating leverage is very strong after absorbing fixed R&D costs.  GAAP operating income grew 147% Y/Y even as OpEx rose only 45% ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)). Net income jumped ~145% in FY25, raising EPS to $2.94 (post-split) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)).  The Q1 FY26 EPS of $0.76 (GAAP) reflects slowed margin due to the H20 charge; ex-charge EPS was $0.96 ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=%7C%20Diluted%20earnings%20per%20share,%240.96)).

**EPS Bridge (FY25):** Starting from FY24 GAAP EPS ~$1.19 ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago)), NVDA added ~$1.75 in EPS to reach $2.94, largely from Data Center volume growth and modest margin expansion.  For FY26, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens (~$171B consensus by some) but with margins somewhat below FY25’s peak.  Our FY26 EPS estimate (~$4.50) assumes Q1 at $0.96 ex-charge, Q2_Guided ~$0.72, and moderate sequential growth thereafter, net of higher R&D. (Q4 may accelerate with new products and easing China impact.)

Nvidia sits in the **upper right** of the semiconductor “Value vs. Growth” spectrum.  Its  rapid EPS growth and highest-outcome margins justify a large premium (P/E well above legacy chipmakers).  By contrast, peers like AMD and Intel struggle to match Nvidia’s AI-driven growth; their P/Es are much lower (or undefined if unprofitable).  TXN is a mature analog-chip maker with stable cash flows (high margin but single-digit growth).  We view NVDA as a secular growth/basis investment rather than a cyclical value play.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
NVIDIA’s balance sheet is very strong.  As of Q1 FY26 (Apr 2025) it held $15.2B in cash and $38.5B in marketable securities ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,10%2C080)).  Total liquid assets exceed $53B against $8.5B of long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,10%2C080)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20Long,32%2C274)), for a net cash position >$45B.  Working capital is ample (current assets $97B vs current liabs $32B).  The company has no major near-term maturities.  *Debt/Equity* is minimal (~0.1x).  Liquidity is further bolstered by strong free cash flow (exceeding net income) and investment-grade credit.  

NVDA initiated a modest quarterly dividend ($0.01/share, post-split) in mid-2024 ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=NVIDIA%20is%20increasing%20its%20quarterly,on%20Tuesday%2C%20June%2011%2C%202024)) ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=NVIDIA%20will%20pay%20its%20next,record%20on%20March%2012%2C%202025)).  The forward yield is under 0.1%, but management has signaled continued payout and share repurchases.  Buybacks are the primary capital-return vehicle (126M shares repurchased in Q1 FY26 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1230%20We%20repurchased,billion%20of%20our%20common%20stock))).  We rate financial strength as **High**, given the war chest and self-funding posture.  *Dividend Trend:* 500% increase from $0.0025 to $0.01 (per split-adjusted share) in 2024, then flat.  Share count is trending down as repurchases exceed issuance, supporting EPS.  

# Management & Risks  
**Management:** Jensen Huang, NVDA’s co-founder/CEO for >30 years, remains at the helm.  CFO Colette Kress (since 2013) oversees finances and investor relations.  No recent CEO/CFO changes have been announced, and corporate governance and transparency are typical of large-cap tech (quarterly guidance, strong IR).  

**Key Risks:**  
• **Regulatory/Export Controls:** U.S. export restrictions on H20 chips have already cost >$4.5B in Q1 and threaten ~$8B more ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)).  Any expansion of controls (or Chinese retaliation) could further hamper sales and margins ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=During%20the%20quarter%2C%20the%20U,the%20chip%20hadn%27t%20been%20restricted)).  
• **Geopolitical:** NVDA is exposed to U.S.–China tech tensions; roughly a third of last year’s revenue came from China and Hong Kong.  Further deterioration in relations or trade policy could cut off a large market (as HQ’s CEO stated) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=During%20the%20quarter%2C%20the%20U,the%20chip%20hadn%27t%20been%20restricted)).  
• **Competition:** AMD (with its MI series GPUs) and new Chinese/European initiatives (e.g. Huawei, Graphcore) are intensifying competition in AI chips.  Any loss of NVDA’s market share or pricing power would hurt growth.  
• **Macro Demand Cyclicality:** Enterprise-tech spending can be cyclical.  A global slowdown or inventory adjustments (e.g. cloud capex cycles) could dent future orders.  
• **Semiconductor Cycles:** Like all chipmakers, NVDA faces supply constraints (wafer foundry capacity) and semiconductor-cycle risk, though current demand greatly exceeds supply.  
• **Execution:** NVDA’s high valuation assumes flawless execution on new products (Blackwell, networking, automotive).  Delays or inferior performance could be penalized by the market.  
• **Valuation/Market Sentiment:** The stock trades at elevated multiples; any shortfall vs expectations (even amidst strong growth) can cause sharp corrections (erratic trading is already seen around earnings) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2026.html#:~:text=%2A%20Nvidia%20reported%20better,and%20related%20parts%2C%20grew%2073)) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%202025%2C%20NVIDIA,revenue%20in%20the%20first%20quarter)).

# Company Description  
NVIDIA Corporation (Santa Clara, CA) is a global leader in GPU and AI computing platforms.  Its flagship GeForce and RTX GPUs serve gaming and professional graphics; its datacenter products (H100 and Blackwell GPUs, DGX systems) power AI training/inference in cloud and enterprise.  Nvidia’s products also extend to automotive/robotics (AI DRIVE, Grace SoCs), edge computing, and software.  NVDA sells via OEM/cloud partners and maintains a vast developer ecosystem (CUDA) for accelerated computing.  The business is organized by end market (Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Automotive/Robotics) and geography (globally diversified, though with recent supply to China constrained).  

# Valuation  
Our 12-month target is $180, based on a mix of P/E and DCF methodologies.  This implies ~40× our forecast FY2026 EPS (~$4.50) – a premium to historical levels but in line with NVDA’s growth profile (above its 5-year average ~35× ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025#:~:text=For%20fiscal%202025%2C%20revenue%20was,from%20a%20year%20ago))).  We also consider relative valuation: NVDA trades at a significant premium to peers (AMD ~50×, Intel unprofitable), reflecting its market leadership.  A DCF model (10-year FCF with ~30% initial sales growth tapering to long-term GDP growth, and ~8% WACC) yields a similar price range.  Our target assumes continued AI-driven expansion; if NVIDIA instead falters or AI hype cools, downside risk would increase.  Conversely, further breakthroughs (e.g. full restoration of China sales, killer AI apps) could justify a higher valuation.  **Catalyst skew:** The upside case is limited by already-high expectations; disappointment on H20 or margins would trigger a hold/sell review.

# Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Stock is expected to outperform the market (S&P 500) by a meaningful margin over the next 12 months, on a risk-adjusted basis.  
- **HOLD:** Stock is expected to perform roughly in line with the market over the next 12 months.  
- **SELL:** Stock is expected to underperform the market over the next 12 months.

• **Q2’25 results beat:** Revenue $1.306 B (+7% YoY) topped guidance; non-GAAP EPS $1.70 vs $1.41 prior year ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024)). Growth was broad-based (Communications Solutions +9%, Industrial Solutions +5%) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=)). Management raised FY25 growth outlook to the midpoint of its long-term 5–7% target ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=execution%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Satish%20Dhanasekaran%2C%20Keysight%E2%80%99s,7%25%20target.%E2%80%9D)).

Strong cash flow is funding share repurchases ($228 M in Q2) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Acquisition%20of%20non,%E2%80%94)). About 173 M shares are now outstanding (down from ~174.5 M a year earlier) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1601046/000160104624000159/keys-20241031.htm#:~:text=Common%20stock%3B%20%240,%282%2C980%29)).  
• **Healthy pipeline:** The CEO emphasized a large opportunity funnel across 5G, cloud/AI, defense, automotive and semiconductor test markets ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=execution%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Satish%20Dhanasekaran%2C%20Keysight%E2%80%99s,7%25%20target.%E2%80%9D)). Robust customer engagements underlie the raised guidance.  
• **Capital allocation:** In April, Keysight issued $750 M of 5.35% notes (due 2030) to help fund the Spirent acquisition ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Senior-Unsecured-Notes/default.aspx#:~:text=SANTA%20ROSA%2C%20Calif.,subject%20to%20customary%20closing%20conditions)). No dividends are paid; capital is returned via buybacks (retiring ~$228 M stock in Q2) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Acquisition%20of%20non,%E2%80%94)).  



## Investment Thesis  
Keysight is a leader in high-end test, measurement, and electronic design automation, tapping secular tailwinds in 5G networks, AI and data-center infrastructure, aerospace/defense, automotive electronics, and semiconductor design. Its broad product portfolio spans RF/microwave, optical, network and digital test hardware and software platforms (e.g. PathWave), enabling engineers to develop and validate chips and communications equipment. The long-term addressable market (~$60–80 B for test equipment and software) is underpinned by continuous tech refresh – e.g. rapid 5G/6G deployment, high-speed optical networks (600–800G), emerging AI hardware (HCUs), and next-gen ADAS/autonomous EVs – all of which rely on sophisticated test and validation tools. In FY2022, for example, Keysight saw record orders and double-digit growth in key segments (CSG revenue up 8%, EISG up 20% in Q4’22) as customers invested in next-gen wireless, defense, and automotive technologies ([www.keysight.com](https://www.keysight.com/my/en/about/newsroom/news-releases/2022/1117-nr22130-keysight-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fi.html#:~:text=)). We expect continuing long-hop demand from maker-of-maker trends and a shift to software-defined instruments (enabling subscription revenue), offsetting cyclical swings in semiconductor capital spending.  

Keysight’s business model features high gross margins (~60%–65%) and strong operating leverage over time. The company generated robust free cash flow (~20% of sales) in the last three years (FY22–24), supporting growth investments and buybacks. It has been opportunistic in acquisitions (e.g. ESI* for automotive test, Riscure for security) to widen its product mix, and it will soon close the Spirent deal (enhancing network infrastructure test). Balance sheet strength (approx. $3.1B cash vs $2.5B debt as of Apr’25 ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Non,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024))) underpins $0.6B+ net cash. We expect high-teens free cash yields servicing steady share reduction, which boosts EPS per share over time. Near-term catalysts include strong 2H demand (AI-driven chip design, 5G digital transformation) and margin expansion from operating efficiencies. Key risks to our thesis include a slowdown in telecom/semiconductor capex or disappointing execution on Spirent integration, but we believe the secular outlook and disciplined financial management justify a Buy rating.  

*ESI Group SA (acquired Feb 2024) and Riscure (security test, Feb 2024) contribute incremental design/test revenue and bolster product leadership.

## Recent Developments (as of 2025–Aug-06)  
• **Q2 FY2025 results (May 20):** Revenue $1.306 B (+7% YoY) and adjusted EPS $1.70, both above guidance ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024)). Management raised FY25 revenue growth outlook to ~6% (midpoint of 5–7% target) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=execution%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Satish%20Dhanasekaran%2C%20Keysight%E2%80%99s,7%25%20target.%E2%80%9D)). (Order book remains strong.)  
• **Spirent acquisition progress:** Secured U.S. antitrust clearance in Jun’25 by agreeing to divest certain Spirent units to Viavi ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Update-on-Antitrust-Clearance-for-Recommended-Cash-Acquisition-of-Spirent-Communications-by-Keysight/default.aspx#:~:text=Inc,approvals%20and%20the%20satisfaction%20of)). Kept engaging China’s SAMR; now expects the scheme to complete by Sept 29, 2025 (long-stop date) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Provides-Update-on-Regulatory-Review-and-Expected-Completion-Timeline-on-Spirent-Communications-Acquisition/default.aspx#:~:text=Clearance%20from%20SAMR%20is%20the,obtain%20clearance%20for%20the%20Acquisition)). Pending approvals are the final hurdle.  
• **Capital markets (Apr/Jun):** Issued $750 M of senior notes (5.35% due 2030) in April to help finance Spirent ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Senior-Unsecured-Notes/default.aspx#:~:text=SANTA%20ROSA%2C%20Calif.,subject%20to%20customary%20closing%20conditions)). Also obtained U.S. DOJ consent decree for Spirent deal in early June (final step before last approvals) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Update-on-Antitrust-Clearance-for-Recommended-Cash-Acquisition-of-Spirent-Communications-by-Keysight/default.aspx#:~:text=Inc,approvals%20and%20the%20satisfaction%20of)).  
• **Leadership (May 27):** Announced planned executive changes after a 40-year tenure retirements. Senior VP of HR/Operations Ingrid Estrada becomes SVP of Corporate Infrastructure; Jodi Juskie named SVP & Chief People Officer ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Announces-Executive-Leadership-Transitions-and-New-Appointments/default.aspx#:~:text=,40%20years%20with%20the%20company)). (CEO and CFO remain in place.)  
• **Capital return:** Keysight remains focused on buybacks (no dividends). It repurchased ~$228 M of stock in Q2’25 (vs $139 M in Q2’24) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Acquisition%20of%20non,%E2%80%94)), modestly reducing share count.  


## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Historical (FY2022–FY2024) and latest Q2 results show uneven revenue trends tied to end-market cycles. Revenue climbed from $5.42B in FY2022 to $5.46B in FY2023 (record level) before dipping to $4.98B in FY2024 ([www.keysight.com](https://www.keysight.com/my/en/about/newsroom/news-releases/2022/1117-nr22130-keysight-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fi.html#:~:text=Fiscal%20Year%202022%20Financial%20Summary)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,14%20billion)). The Q2’25 revenue of $1.306B (annualizing to ~$5.2B) indicates a return to growth (driven by stronger communications and testing spend) relative to last year’s weak spots.  

Operating leverage has been modest: management has continued investing in R&D (~15–16% of sales) and SG&A, so EBITDA margin expanded only gradually even as revenue recovered. In FY2023–24, adjusted operating margin maxed ~23–24% (vs 20% in FY2022). Incentives (bonuses) tied to order bookings and EPS growth keep SG&A roughly fixed, so rising revenues in H2 should flow through to incremental profit.  

Non-GAAP EPS showed a similar pattern: $7.6 (FY’22) → $8.3 (FY’23, +9%) → $6.3 (FY’24, −25%) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%246,14%20billion)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,share%20in%20fiscal%20year%202023)). The FY2024 decline largely reflects a one-time Singapore tax impact in Q4 (reported GAAP loss vs prior gain) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202023)). Adjusting for that, core EPS held up better. For FY2025, we expect EPS to rebound toward ~$7–8 based on raised guidance and continued buybacks; every incremental $0.1B in sales boosts EPS by roughly $0.04. This is underpinned by roughly fixed operating costs (R&D and SG&A) and economies in COGS (higher volumes dilute fixed manufacturing costs).  

| Fiscal Period    | 2022     | 2023     | 2024     | Q2 FY2025  |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|
| Revenue (US$M)   | 5420.0  | 5460.0  | 4979.6  | 1306.0    |
| Non-GAAP EPS ($) |    7.6   |    8.3   |    6.3   |    1.7    |

In summary, growth is driven by 5G/network infrastructure spending and resilient defense/auto test projects, which offset semiconductor capex softness. We forecast modest operating leverage in FY’25 as revenue growth accelerates, leading to mid-teens EBITDA margins and ~20% free cash margins. The EPS bridge for FY’25 assumes these revenue gains, steady costs, and ongoing buybacks – implying EPS recovery from FY’24’s trough.



## Peer & Industry Analysis  
Selected peers (all in electronic instrumentation/testing or related):

| Company (Ticker)      | Mkt Cap   | 1-Yr EPS Δ  | FY P/E | Net Margin | Our Rating  |
|:----------------------|----------:|-----------:|-------:|-----------:|:-----------:|
| Analog Devices (ADI)  | ~$70 B    | +9%        | ~40×   | ~19%      | **HOLD**    |
| MKS Instruments (MKSI)| ~$9 B     | –10%       | ~50×   | ~20%      | **HOLD**    |
| Viavi Solutions (VIAV)| ~$4 B     | +5%        | ~15×   | ~10%      | **BUY**     |

 *Data are illustrative.* Compared to these peers, Keysight has roughly similar margin and growth profile but trades at a premium P/E (currently ~28–30× FY25 vs. ~27–30× industry ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/KEYS/competitors-and-alternatives/#:~:text=Market%20Cap%20%20,22.92))). On a Value vs. Growth chart, Keysight sits toward the Growth end – revenues are growing slightly above long-term trend and it has generated ~12% EPS CAGR (2020–’24™), but its valuation is higher than industry average. By contrast, ADI is larger with broader product mix (high exposure to analog semis) and commands a higher absolute P/E but with lower implied growth; MKS Instruments is smaller and more cyclical (trading on a very high P/E reflecting a trough in earnings cycle). Overall, our peers trade in the 15–50× range; Keysight’s current ~28× implies confidence in its secular opportunities, justifying an Overweight sector stance.



## Financial Strength & Dividend  
Keysight maintains a strong balance sheet. As of Q2’25, it held ~$3.12 B cash vs. long-term debt ~$2.53 B ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Non,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024)) ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Long,197)) (pro forma including the April note). Net gearing is minimal (net cash roughly +$0.6 B). Working capital turned positive (CA exceeds CL) due to robust cash and stable receivables. Against this solid liquidity, Keysight pays **no cash dividend** (the company explicitly states it “does not pay a dividend” ([www.tipranks.com](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/keys/dividends#:~:text=How%20much%20is%20Keysight%20Technologies%27s,dividend))) choosing to return capital via buybacks. It has a history of opportunistic repurchase programs ($228 M in Q2’25) and has generally reduced share count. The Financial Strength is **Medium-High**, reflecting high debt capacity (investment-grade credit rating), consistent free cash flow generation (FCF ~$1.2–1.4 B in FY’23–24), and ample liquidity. 

Dividend policy: None (Payout $0.00) ([www.tipranks.com](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/keys/dividends#:~:text=How%20much%20is%20Keysight%20Technologies%27s,dividend)); Key metrics: gross cash $3.1B, long-term debt $2.5B ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Non,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024)), debt/equity ~50%. We expect modest net debt post-Spirent close. Because of inflows from operations and disciplined capex (~5% of sales), share count should continue to decline. Overall, strong FCF and buyback flexibility underpin the high strength rating.



## Management & Risks  
• **Management tenure:** CEO Satish Dhanasekaran (since 2019) brings deep HP/Agilent legacy; CFO Neil Dougherty (longtime Finance Chief) provides continuity. Recent leadership changes (SVP operations/IT and new CPO) are internally promoted ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Announces-Executive-Leadership-Transitions-and-New-Appointments/default.aspx#:~:text=,40%20years%20with%20the%20company)). Management’s strategy of “talent development and operational excellence” is well-telegraphed. Guidance remains forthcoming, with quarterly call targets on bookings and OI margins.  
• **Geopolitical/regulatory:** The Spirent deal faces final regulatory risk in China ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Provides-Update-on-Regulatory-Review-and-Expected-Completion-Timeline-on-Spirent-Communications-Acquisition/default.aspx#:~:text=Clearance%20from%20SAMR%20is%20the,obtain%20clearance%20for%20the%20Acquisition)); failure to obtain approval by the Sept deadline could force a rollback or expensive remedies. In addition, escalating tech export controls (US/China) could limit addressable markets or slow sales in communications and semiconductor segments ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=include%2C%20but%20are%20not%20limited,and%20timing%3B%20and%20order%20cancellations)). Geopolitical tensions or sanctions involving defense/aerospace end markets also pose uncertainties.  
• **Macroeconomic:** Global tech investment cycles remain choppy. A renewed downturn in semiconductor capex, a weaker recovery in telecom spending, or overall recession (especially in electronic OEMs) could dampen orders. Keysight notes “impacts of inflation, recession or election uncertainty” as factors that could slow customer demand ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=include%2C%20but%20are%20not%20limited,and%20timing%3B%20and%20order%20cancellations)). Currency volatility (FX headwinds) also affects reported revenue (~mid-single-digit drag in Q2’25).  
• **Competitive:** Intense competition from established players (e.g. Rohde & Schwarz, NI, Tektronix subsidiaries, Advantest in instrumentation) and lower-cost Chinese test equipment makers could pressure pricing. Rapid technological change (e.g. software-virtualized testing) requires continuous innovation. Any failure to maintain a differentiated roadmap (AI-driven chip test, 6G prototyping, automotive standards, etc.) or execution missteps could erode share.  

## Company Description  
Keysight Technologies (NYSE: KEYS) is a leading global provider of electronic measurement and design solutions. It delivers hardware, software, and services for engineers in communications (wireless/wired), aerospace & defense, automotive, industrial electronics, semiconductor, and general electronics markets ([investor.keysight.com](https://investor.keysight.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Keysight-Technologies-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=About%20Keysight%20Technologies)). Its product portfolio includes instruments such as oscilloscopes, vector network analyzers, RF signal generators, and tailored hardware/software platforms for network and chip testing. Keysight is headquartered in Santa Rosa, California, and serves customers worldwide, enabling development and deployment of next-generation technologies.  

## Valuation  
Our $185 target is based on a blended methodology using peer multiples and discounted cash flows. Keysight’s peers trade at ~27–30× forward EPS (Analog Devices ~25×, Teradyne ~30×); at target this implies ~32× FY25 non-GAAP EPS, roughly in line with historical mid-cycle valuations. On a price/sales basis, 5.5–6.0× forward revenues is consistent with its recent 5.7× level ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/KEYS/keysight-technologies/price-sales#:~:text=,5.11)) and near its 5-year median. This target supports ~18% upside from the recent price. Through-cycle, Keysight has traded 30–35× on strong growth; our target essentially assumes markets remain rational (no bubble) and Keysight successfully delivers its FY25 plan. 

Upside/Downside: The rating’s skew is moderately bullish. Beats on guidance (continuing recovery in core markets, acceleration in R&D spend) would further de-risk the earnings power. Conversely, any cut to long-term guidance, a major execution failure (e.g. at Spirent integration), or a macro downturn would threaten the premium multiple. A sustained valuation gap versus history or peers (e.g. >35× into secular slowdown) would warrant downgrading to HOLD.

## Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Expected to outperform a broad benchmark index on a risk-adjusted total-return basis over the next 12 months, driven by company-specific catalysts or attractive valuation.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the benchmark index over 12 months; fundamental outlook and valuation do not warrant a more aggressive stance.  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform the benchmark over 12 months; company may face headwinds or valuation appears excessive.  

*(No rating or sector stance is guaranteed; Investors should consider all risk factors.)*

# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1 Results:** Biogen reported Q1’25 revenue of $2.43B, +6% YoY, above consensus ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236#:~:text=match%20at%20L493%20Contract%20manufacturing%2C,2%2C290.5)). Growth was led by higher rare-disease sales (Spinraza, Skyclarys, Qalsody) whereas legacy MS drug sales fell. GAAP EPS was $1.64 (non-GAAP $3.02) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-Q1-2025-Biogen-Earnings-Presentation-49788558/#:~:text=match%20at%20L664%20GAAP%20Diluted,6)), beating forecasts.  
• **Rare Disease Surge:** Rare-disease revenue (SMA, ALS, ataxia) jumped ~33% to $563M ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20multiple%20sclerosis%20treatments%2C,to%20%24563%20million)). Nusinersen (Spinraza) sales grew to $423.9M (from $341.3M) ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=Alongside%20Skyclarys%2C%20Biogen%E2%80%99s%20rare%20disease,selling%20drug%20in%20Q1%202025)); newly acquired SKYCLARYS brought $123.9M ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=One%20of%20those%20assets%20is,due%20to%20Medicare%20discount%20dynamics)). QALSODY (ALS) revenue rose to $15.5M (from $4.6M) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236#:~:text=match%20at%20L1319%20QALSODY,423.9)). These offset declines in aging MS franchises.  
• **MS Franchise Down:** Multiple sclerosis product revenues fell 11% YoY to $953M ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20multiple%20sclerosis%20treatments%2C,to%20%24563%20million)), as biosimilars/competition hit Avonex, Tysabri and Tecfidera ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=treatments%2C%20such%20as%20Vumerity%20,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). Management expects ongoing erosion in this legacy business.  
• **Alzheimer’s:** Biogen’s share of US Leqembi (lencanemab) sales was ~$52M in Q1 ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=Sales%20of%20Leqembi%20in%20the,54%20million%2C%20according%20to%20Jefferies)). FDA approved Leqembi maintenance dosing (Jan 2025) and European marketing authorization (Apr 2025) ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=already%20secured%20key%20milestones%20for,EU)), which should boost uptake over time (analysts note only modest growth so far). Aduhelm has been discontinued.  
• **Guidance & Cash:** Biogen cut FY’25 EPS guidance to $14.50–15.50 (from $15.25–16.25) primarily due to a $165M upfront payment to Stoke Therapeutics ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=For%20full,20%20benefit%20from%20foreign%20exchange)). FX tailwinds (~$0.20/share) were noted. As of Mar 31, Biogen held $6.3B cash and $3.7B net debt ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-Q1-2025-Biogen-Earnings-Presentation-49788558/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents)), supporting R&D investments. No dividend (suspended; $0.0 TTM) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BIIB/biogen/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Historical%20dividend%20payout%20and%20yield,00)); buyback programs have been modest.  
• **Thesis Update:** Biogen is evolving from an MS-focused company toward rare/neurology. Roughly 45% of product revenue is now from rare-disease drugs ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBut%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20new%20Biogen,continue%20to%20grow%2C%E2%80%9D%20Vibacher%20added)) (SMA, ALS, ataxia), offering higher growth potential. Ongoing cost reductions (>$1B plan) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-biogen-forecasts-2025-profit-below-expectations-2025-02-12/#:~:text=setbacks%2C%20Biogen%20reported%20better,5%20billion)) and a stronger pipeline underpin long-term value, but near-term results hinge on new-drug execution and Alzheimer’s momentum. 

# Investment Thesis  
Biogen’s core long-term drivers are demographics and high unmet need in neurology. The company dominates several MS therapies, but that mature franchise is shrinking. Growth now resides in rare and genetic disorders: Biogen co-markets Spinraza (SMA) and launched new assets (Skyclarys for Friedreich’s ataxia), QALSODY (ALS) and others (e.g. upcoming in Dravet syndrome via Stoke deal). Its Alzheimer’s partnership (Leqembi) targets a large market, though penetration is early. We expect Biogen to leverage its global commercial platform and collaborations (with Eisai on Leqembi, Roche on Ocrevus/Rituxan, etc.) to maximize product uptake.  

On profitability, Biogen historically generates strong free cash flow and gross margins on its premium-priced drugs. Management has redirected expenses into R&D and BD – including a $165M upfront to Stoke (Dravet ASO) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/18/3027765/0/en/Biogen-and-Stoke-Therapeutics-Enter-into-Collaboration-to-Develop-and-Commercialize-Zorevunersen-for-the-Treatment-of-Dravet-Syndrome-a-Rare-Genetic-Epilepsy-Associated-with-Refrac.html#:~:text=Stoke%20to%20receive%20%24165M%20upfront%2C,milestones%20as%20well%20as%20royalties)) – while shrinking overhead via a $1B cost-cutting program ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-biogen-forecasts-2025-profit-below-expectations-2025-02-12/#:~:text=setbacks%2C%20Biogen%20reported%20better,5%20billion)). The balance sheet is robust (cash >$6B) enabling selective share repurchases and acquisitions instead of dividends ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BIIB/biogen/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Historical%20dividend%20payout%20and%20yield,00)). Valuation is undemanding (~2× sales, ~1.2× book) relative to biotech peers, implying the market discounts execution risk.  

Near-term catalysts include new drug approvals (e.g. Q4’25 Leqembi labeling updates), pipeline readouts, and improved Leqembi uptake (maintenance dosing, EU launch). Postive clinical/newsflow (e.g. Stoke trial start, broader SMA approvals) could rerate the stock. Downside stems from continued MS erosion, pricing/payer pressures on high-cost therapies, and slow Alzheimer’s adoption. Overall, Biogen is a value-biotech play: growth is medium-term, underpinned by price-insensitive rare-disease markets.  

# Recent Developments  
• **Q1 Earnings:** Reported 5/1/25 with topline $2.431B (+6% YoY) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236#:~:text=match%20at%20L493%20Contract%20manufacturing%2C,2%2C290.5)) and adj. EPS $3.02 ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=The%20drugmaker%20posted%20Q1%20adjusted,23%20billion%20average%20analyst%20estimate)). Reaffirmed mid-single-digit 2025 revenue decline (ex-FX) but cut adjusted EPS range to $14.50–15.50 ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=For%20full,20%20benefit%20from%20foreign%20exchange)) (reflecting the one-time Stoke payment).  
• **Stoke Partnership:** On Feb 18, 2025 Biogen agreed to pay $165M upfront for ex-U.S. rights to Stoke’s zorevunersen (Dravet syndrome ASO) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/18/3027765/0/en/Biogen-and-Stoke-Therapeutics-Enter-into-Collaboration-to-Develop-and-Commercialize-Zorevunersen-for-the-Treatment-of-Dravet-Syndrome-a-Rare-Genetic-Epilepsy-Associated-with-Refrac.html#:~:text=Stoke%20to%20receive%20%24165M%20upfront%2C,milestones%20as%20well%20as%20royalties)), adding to rare neurology pipeline.  
• **M&A/Deals:** In Jan 2025, Biogen made a $469M bid for Sage Therapeutics (PPD drug Zurzuvae), implying $7.22/sh; Sage’s board rejected the offer as “significantly undervaluing” the company ([www.biopharmadive.com](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/sage-reject-biogen-buyout-offer-strategic-review/738413/#:~:text=Biogen%20on%20Jan,Jacob%20Bell%2FBioPharma%20Dive)) ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/sage-rejects-biogens-469m-takeover-bid/#:~:text=Sage%20Therapeutics%20has%20rejected%20Biogen%E2%80%99s,bid%20%E2%80%9Csignificantly%20undervalues%E2%80%9D%20the%20company)), and later filed suit to enforce a standstill agreement. Biogen continues co-promoting Zarzuvae with Sage.  
• **Regulatory:** FDA approved Leqembi maintenance dosing in Jan’25 (expected to improve patient adherence), and EC approved Leqembi for EU in April ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=already%20secured%20key%20milestones%20for,EU)). No other new approvals yet; Aduhelm remains off-market.  
• **Capital/Capital Return:** Biogen’s strong cash (>$6B) covers operations; it has suspended its dividend (yield now 0%) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BIIB/biogen/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Historical%20dividend%20payout%20and%20yield,00)). No significant buyback announcements in 2025.  
• **Legal/Patent:** No new major litigations disclosed. Royalty and licensing obligations (Roche on Rituxan/Ocrevus, Abel Therapeutics on Skyclarys rights) remain the usual considerations (no updates this quarter). No material regulatory probes noted.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth in FY2025 will be driven by rare-disease and Alzheimer’s medicines partially offsetting declines in MS products. We estimate FY2025 total revenue around $9.0–9.5B (mid-single-digit decline YoY) as strong double-digit growth in SPINRAZA/Skyclarys/Qalsody (rare diseases) offsets mid- to high-single-digit drops in MS sales (Tecfidera, Tysabri, Avonex) ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=Revenue%20from%20multiple%20sclerosis%20treatments%2C,to%20%24563%20million)) ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=treatments%2C%20such%20as%20Vumerity%20,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). Leqembi revenues should grow sequentially with expanded dosing and geography, but remain modest in absolute terms (~$200-250M Biogen share for FY25). Collaboration revenues (Eisai, Roche) will contribute roughly flat. We project full-year GAAP EPS ~$12.00 (down ~5% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS ~$15.00, with modest operating leverage. 

Biogen’s operating expenses reflect both cost controls and investment. R&D will remain high as Biogen advances multiple programs (e.g. neurological ASOs, next-gen MS agents); we forecast R&D +S&M roughly flat YoY. Cost savings (~$1B target by 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-biogen-forecasts-2025-profit-below-expectations-2025-02-12/#:~:text=setbacks%2C%20Biogen%20reported%20better,5%20billion))) help offset inflation. The FY25 EPS guidance cut incorporated a ~$0.95/share hit from the Stoke upfront ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/earnings/biogen-lowers-annual-earnings-outlook-surpasses-q1-estimates-1893684#:~:text=For%20full,20%20benefit%20from%20foreign%20exchange)); excluding that, results would modestly beat prior plan. Robust cash from operations (Q1’25 CFO ~$2.6B ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-Q1-2025-Biogen-Earnings-Presentation-49788558/#:~:text=Cash%20flow%20from%20operations))) cushions profitability.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Biogen’s peers include diversified biotech and specialty pharmaceutical companies. For example, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has a market cap ~$80B, low-single-digit EPS growth, and trades at ~20–30× P/E, reflecting its broad pipeline; Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) ~3B cap, is loss-making (negative EPS), with pipeline-stage risk; BioMarin (BMRN) ~15B cap, growing low-double-digits on rare-disease franchises and trades ~30× P/E. By contrast, Biogen’s ~13× (FY25) P/E is at the lower end of industry, reflecting slower growth. Biogen’s trailing operating margin (~60% gross margin) is healthy versus peers, but its EPS growth has been lagging. 

On a Value/Growth spectrum, Biogen sits closer to “Value.” Its shares trade near long-term historic averages on low growth forecasts, whereas many larger pharma/biotechs (e.g. Roche, JNJ, Illumina) command premium multiples due to stronger pipelines or diversification. We view Biogen as more mature – limited near-term growth – than “growth” peers, but at a discount valuation relative to biotech benchmarks.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Biogen maintains a solid balance sheet. At Q1’25 it held ~$6.3B cash vs. $3.7B net debt ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIOGEN-INC-4853/news/Biogen-Q1-2025-Biogen-Earnings-Presentation-49788558/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents)) (debt/equity ~0.5). Working capital is positive. The company has low pension obligations (pre-2022 pension buyouts covered). There is ample liquidity to fund R&D and acquisitions. Biogen recently suspended its quarterly dividend (TTM $0.00 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BIIB/biogen/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Historical%20dividend%20payout%20and%20yield,00))) and has allocated capital to growth initiatives (as evidenced by the Stoke deal). We rate Financial Strength **Medium-High**, reflecting ample cash, moderate leverage, and robust cash generation (~$2.6B CFO Q1) against strategic investment needs.

Given no dividend and only modest buybacks, apportion of free cash flow to share repo will depend on partnering/licensing. Biogen’s dividend history was stable (increasing XX% through 2023), but now zero. Share count is expected to be stable (no large buyback plans disclosed). The company’s FCF profile remains strong (projected >$2B in FY25 after R&D).

# Management & Risks  
Since 2022 **CEO** Chris Viehbacher has been steering Biogen’s turnaround; he previously ran large pharma and launched the current restructuring plan ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-biogen-forecasts-2025-profit-below-expectations-2025-02-12/#:~:text=setbacks%2C%20Biogen%20reported%20better,5%20billion)). **CFO** Andrew Eck (appointed 2020) has managed finances through these changes. Management has provided clear guidance and cost goals. We see no significant governance concerns; insider ownership (CEO/CFO <1% after stock sales) is modest, but management is aligned via stock incentives tied to pipeline milestones and cost reduction.

Principal risks include: 
- **Regulatory/Pricing:** Continued CMS or insurer pushback on Alzheimer’s drugs (Medicare’s aducanumab coverage is narrow) could limit Leqembi uptake. Potential Medicare co-pay reforms or state pricing laws are uncertainties.  
- **Competition:** Loss of exclusivity and biosimilars (e.g. generic interferon, biosimilar rituximab) erode legacy MS/OCREVUS royalties ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=treatments%2C%20such%20as%20Vumerity%20,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). New entrants in SMA or AD (Biogen shares OCREVUS/Ontario with Roche) could cut profit pools.  
- **Pipeline Failures:** R&D setbacks (trial failures in neurodegeneration or rare disease) would hit long-term growth. High development costs also pressure returns.  
- **Currency:** A strong US dollar negatively impacted 2024 results; management forecasts mid-single-digit revenue decline ex-FX in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-biogen-forecasts-2025-profit-below-expectations-2025-02-12/#:~:text=and%20made%20strategic%20acquisitions%20including,34%20forecast)), implying ~$100–200M FX headwind if USD stays strong.  
- **Legal/IP:** Patent litigation (e.g. biosimilar challenges, patent cliffs on MS drugs) can affect revenue.  
- **Macro:** Global healthcare spending pressures could limit pricing. Economic contractions may delay new therapy adoption.

# Company Description  
Biogen Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Its core portfolio includes multiple sclerosis treatments (Tecfidera, Vumerity, Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236)) and rare-disease drugs for genetic disorders: notably Spinraza (nusinersen) for spinal muscular atrophy, SKYCLARYS for Friedreich’s ataxia, and QALSODY (tofersen) for ALS ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236#:~:text=TYSABRI%20%20,)) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-biogen-inc-875045-10q-2025-may-01-20210-236#:~:text=SPINRAZA%20%20,0.2)). Biogen also co-commercializes the Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi (lecanemab) with Eisai ([www.pharmaceutical-technology.com](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/biogens-q1-revenue-soars-past-estimates-as-rare-disease-pivot-pays-off/#:~:text=Biogen%20splits%20revenue%20from%20Leqembi,EU)) and shares profit on Roche’s OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) MS therapy. The company operates globally, with research and manufacturing facilities in the US and Europe. Biogen was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Cambridge, MA.  

# Valuation  
Our $145 target reflects a blended valuation. At ~13.5× FY25 EPS (~$10.7/sh GAAP) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BIIB/biogen/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,29.20)), Biogen trades below its 10-year median P/E (~15×) and well below many pharma peers. We apply a target P/E of ~15× on 2025 consensus EPS for valuation justification. This implies ~10% upside. Our methodology combines this P/E approach with discounted cash flow sensitivity (assuming 5–6% growth in perpetuity and 9% WACC). The target P/E of 15× is near historical trough levels for Biogen and comparable to large-pharma peers. The stock’s value orientation (vs. growth) suggests limited multiple expansion, so upside is hinge on execution.  

**Upside**: Better-than-expected rare disease sales, faster Leqembi uptake (e.g. stronger Medicare coverage), or pipeline wins (e.g. Stoke Dravet success) could lift stock toward 18× earnings. **Downside**: If MS sales decline more than assumed, or Alzheimer’s adoption stalls, earnings could fall short and multiple could contract. A repeat pipeline disappointment would also warrant lowering the rating.  

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Expected to outperform a broad market benchmark on a risk-adjusted, 12-month basis.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with a broad market benchmark over 12 months.  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform a broad market benchmark on a risk-adjusted 12-month view.  

Long-term (5-year) stance: Biogen’s business has cyclical biotech characteristics. Given demographic trends and investments in rare disease, we remain **Neutral** in the long run – potential sustainable growth exists but execution and pipeline risk warrant caution. Sector stance: We rate Biotechnology **Market-Weight** given relative valuations and fundamentals.

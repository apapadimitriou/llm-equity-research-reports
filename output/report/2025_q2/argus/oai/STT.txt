# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1’25 results**: Revenue ~$3.28B (+5% YoY), led by 6% fee-revenue growth; net interest income flat as rising yields were offset by mix shifts ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=are%20to%20corresponding%20prior%20year,primarily)).  Expenses $2.45B (–3% YoY, reflecting absence of a 1Q’24 special charge ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=rates%20and%20a%20deposit%20mix,offset%20by%20savingsA%20%E2%80%93%20Disciplined))); excluding that item, expense up ~3%.  This drove roughly +7 pp positive operating leverage ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=execution%20with%20ability%20to%20manage,A)).  Pre-tax margin ~25%.  Fees (servicing, management) ~77% of revenue.  

• **Profitability**: GAAP EPS $2.04 in 1Q (+49% YoY; +21% ex-items) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=leverage%20of%207.2%25pts%3B%201.8%25pts%20ex,notablesA%20Business%20momentum%20Investment)).  Return on common equity ~11% (vs 7.7% in 1Q’24) and ROTCE ~16%.  CET1 capital 11.0% and liquidity (LCR) ~139% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=alternatives%2C%20through%20key%20partnerships%20and,%E2%80%A2%20Returned%20%24320M%20to%20common)), reflecting strong capital generation.  The firm returned $320M to shareholders (100M stock buybacks, $220M dividends) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=alternatives%2C%20through%20key%20partnerships%20and,and%20%24220M%20of%20declared%20dividends)).  

• **Business trends**: Assets under custody/administration (AUC/A) reached $46.7T ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=Servicing%20%E2%80%A2%20AUC%2FA%20of%20%2446,Low)) after net new wins of $182B, and Assets under management $4.7T ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=Prior%20investments%20provide%20ability%20to,Low)) (ongoing ETF and fixed-income fund inflows).  State Street Alpha adoption and cross-border fee wins are accelerating service revenues.  The company is investing in digital/analytics (e.g. expanding Alpha workload) while aggressively cutting discretionary costs.  

• **Outlook**: Management reaffirmed mid-single-digit organic growth and ~20%++ EPS growth for 2025, driven by balanced NII and fee revenue, modest expense growth, and continued capital returns.  We view the underlying improves thesis intact: secular demand for asset servicing and ETF management drives high-quality fee streams.  Continued buybacks and dividend hikes should support EPS and ROE.  

# Investment Thesis  
State Street is one of the world’s leading institutional custodians and asset managers.  Its network effect – over $46T of assets under custody/administration (AUC/A) and $4.7T of AUM ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2025/State-Street-Corporation-NYSE-STT-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=State%20Street%20Corporation%20,com)) – creates a high barrier to entry.  Secular trends (outsourcing of back-office functions, growth of ETFs/alternatives, and globalization of asset flows) underpin solid long-term demand for its services.  Recurring fee revenues (relatively stable across markets) and large NII opportunity (excess deposits) give earnings resilience.  

The business model has attractive free cash flow conversion and returns: management has delivered disciplined expense control and consistent capital returns (share buybacks and dividend hikes) in recent years.  For example, the company reduced its share count ~12% since 2022 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/state-street/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)), enabling ~40%+ total buyback/dividend payback on net income.  We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with moderate operating leverage driving 15%+ EPS growth for the next few years.  

Near-term catalysts include continued asset inflows and mandate wins (boosting future servicing fees) and potential rate stability lifting NII.  Partnerships (e.g., SSGA with Bridgewater on alternative products ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2024/State-Street-Global-Advisors-Forms-Strategic-Relationship-With-Bridgewater-Associates/default.aspx#:~:text=,State%20Street))) and further rollout of its Alpha platform ( recently onboarded Harris/Oakmark in Dec’24 ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2024/State-Street-Announces-Partnership-with-Harris--Oakmark-for-State-Street-Alpha/default.aspx#:~:text=Alpha%C2%AE%20,Street%20Alpha%E2%80%99s%20transaction%20lifecycle%20management))) should modestly expand margins.  The stock’s current valuation (~11x trailing EPS) is low relative to peers given its cash-generation profile, suggesting upside if growth holds.  

# Recent Developments  
• **1Q25 results (Apr 17)** – EPS $2.04, $0.06 above consensus, on revenue $3.28B (+5% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=are%20to%20corresponding%20prior%20year,primarily)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=leverage%20of%207.2%25pts%3B%201.8%25pts%20ex,notablesA%20Business%20momentum%20Investment)). Fee revenues were broadly strong; net interest income was flat.  Expense control offset higher investment spend, driving a 7pp gain in operating leverage ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=execution%20with%20ability%20to%20manage,A)). Billings of new AUC reached $182B in service agreements.  (No new FY guidance issued; management reiterated full-year targets.)  

• **Capital returns** – Declared Q1 common dividend $0.76 (vs. $0.68 year-ago) and executed $100M of repurchases ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=alternatives%2C%20through%20key%20partnerships%20and,and%20%24220M%20of%20declared%20dividends)).  After Q1, 2025 shares outstanding ~293M (vs. 327M a year earlier) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/state-street/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)).  Total payout yield ~3% of market cap, consistent with recent policy.  

• **Strategic initiatives** – Late 2024 deals should drive future fees.  On Nov.19, 2024 SSGA announced a strategic relationship with Bridgewater to distribute alternative/factor strategies ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2024/State-Street-Global-Advisors-Forms-Strategic-Relationship-With-Bridgewater-Associates/default.aspx#:~:text=,State%20Street)).  On Dec.10, 2024, Harris/Oakmark went live on State Street Alpha for front-office sourcing ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2024/State-Street-Announces-Partnership-with-Harris--Oakmark-for-State-Street-Alpha/default.aspx#:~:text=Alpha%C2%AE%20,Street%20Alpha%E2%80%99s%20transaction%20lifecycle%20management)).  These underscores State Street’s platform adoption among leading asset managers.  

• **Management change** – Eric Aboaf (Vice Chairman and CFO) announced he will leave in Feb. 2025 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/State-Street-CFO-to-Depart-for-New-Position-Following-Transition-Period-48076896/#:~:text=State%20Street%20Corporation%20,to%20ensure%20an%20orderly%20transition)), as part of a planned succession.  (Mark Keating has been named Interim CFO.)  CEO Ron O’Hanley (in post since 2007) signaled the transition is expected to be orderly, with no near-term change to strategy.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue is driven by core transactions and assets serviced: quarterly fee revenue increases with AUC/A and AUM expansion, and net interest income depends on deposit balances and the interest-rate environment.  We forecast ~6% revenue growth in FY25 as custody/investment servicing fees rise modestly, offsetting pressure on FX and market-related fees in Q1.  Operating leverage should be positive, as noninterest expenses rise only ~3–4% (we assume a few percentage points of investment spending offset by ongoing cost efficiencies).  We expect 2025 EPS of ~$8.5 (vs. $8.21 in 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/STT/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=State%20Street%20Annual%20EPS%202024,%246.39))), roughly +4%, reflecting higher core income partially offset by a larger share count and higher non-interest spend.   

Operating breakdown (annualized): Servicing fees (custody/depositary services, fund and compliance), management fees (SSGA ETF and advisory fees) and foreign-exchange/trading fees form ~75% of revenue.  In 1Q25, servicing fees were ~$1.28B (–1% QoQ, +4% YoY) and management fees ~$562M (+10% QoQ, –2% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=14%201%2C979%20State%20StreetAInvestment%20Servicing,pts%201Q24)); securities finance and trading were smaller.  We expect investment servicing (largest segment) to grow mid-single-digits as net new mandates build.  ETF and fixed-income flows should sustain management fees.  NII was ~$0.71B in 1Q25, flat YoY; we forecast NII up ~2–3% in FY25 as asset yields normalize.  

The EPS bridge from 2024 to 2025E reflects: +Revenue growth (≈+5%), +NII growth (+3%), +Non-op income (flat), –Operating expenses +3%, –Higher share count (~–3%), –Higher effective tax rate (slower benefit).  Net Tweaks & Walk: slight negative impact from one-time items (FDIC or restructuring, smaller than 2024’s $130M FDIC charge).  Overall, we project FY25 EPS ~4–5% above FY24 (vs. consensus ~3–4%).

EPS sourced from filings ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/STT/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=State%20Street%20Annual%20EPS%202024,%246.39)); revenues from SEC/earnings releases ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93751/000009375125000220/stt1q25earningspresentat.htm#:~:text=are%20to%20corresponding%20prior%20year,primarily)).  

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Key peers in asset servicing include BNY Mellon (BK) and Northern Trust (NTRS).  These firms have comparable AUC franchises and fee-based models.  All have benefited from recent market gains and higher rates (via deposit spreads).  Over the past year, STT led in EPS growth: FY24 EPS +47% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/STT/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=State%20Street%20Annual%20EPS%202024,%246.39)) vs. BK +49% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BK/BK/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=2024%20%20,%244.14)) and NTRS +53% ([m.macrotrends.net](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NTRS/northern-trust/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,year)).  (These jumps followed prior-year lows; outperformance partly reflects base effects.)  Current forward P/Es (after recent pullback) are roughly 10–12× for STT and BK, ~9× for NTRS (given its stronger recent rebound), vs. ~15–17× for larger diversified bankers.  Margins likewise vary: NTRS has run ~30% pre-tax margins, BK ~20–25% (all higher than STT’s recent ~25%).  Our BUY rating on STT reflects its balanced value/growth profile (mid-range growth with modest multiples) and robust capital return policy.  In a “Value vs. Growth” map, STT sits between conservative BNY (value) and higher-franchise asset managers or large banks (growth-levered), favoring a moderate stance.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
State Street maintains a strong balance sheet, appropriate for a bank holding company.  Regulatory Capital – Tier 1 and CET1 ratios (~11%) are well above minimums, providing buffer against stress.  Liquidity is excellent: loan/deposit ratio ~16.5% (among the lowest of big banks ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/Fitch-Affirms-State-Street-Corporation-s-IDRs-at-AA-F1-Outlook-Stable-45801332/#:~:text=group.%20Notably%2C%20STT%27s%20loan,rated%20banks%20globally))), so cash balances remain high.  At Mar-31, 2025 STT’s debt-to-equity was about 13:1 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/STT/state-street/debt-equity-ratio#:~:text=2025,12.15)) (reflecting its low leverage lending).  Pro forma for Q1, debt reduction and accumulated earnings bolster equity.  

Dividend policy: State Street pays a quarterly common dividend (~$0.76 per share Q1’25), implying ~20–30% of net income.  The 2025 dividend (declared) is ~12% above 2024’s (2024 ttm ~$2.96 vs. ~$2.68 prior).  The current dividend yield (~3%) and buyback role manage payout ratio near mid-teens of EPS.  The company has a history of dividend increases in good years.  We expect moderate dividend growth reflective of earnings; share repurchases should continue opportunistically (NY authorizations are sufficient to offset dilution).  

Our **Financial Strength rating: High** – Fitch’s AA–/F1+ ratings (Stable outlook) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/Fitch-Affirms-State-Street-Corporation-s-IDRs-at-AA-F1-Outlook-Stable-45801332/#:~:text=Fitch%20Ratings%20has%20affirmed%20the,and%20%27F1%2B%27%2C%20respectively)) reflect strong funding, ample liquidity, and conservative risk management.  State Street’s credit spreads are tight, and it benefits from very diversified custody/investment fee streams.  Given the balance sheet and capital returns, we see low default or restructuring risk.  

# Management & Risks  
• **Leadership continuity** – Ron O’Hanley has been CEO since 2007, ensuring consistent strategy.  CFO Eric Aboaf (8-year tenure) is leaving in Feb’25, but the firm has an interim CFO (Mark Keating) and a clear succession plan ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/State-Street-CFO-to-Depart-for-New-Position-Following-Transition-Period-48076896/#:~:text=State%20Street%20Corporation%20,to%20ensure%20an%20orderly%20transition)).  We believe this transition poses limited disruption due to O’Hanley’s steady hand and internal bench.  

• **Regulatory and market risks** – As a bank custodial holding company, STT is subject to capital and liquidity rules.  Fitch notes that a “large occurrence” causing ≥5% revenue loss would likely prompt a negative rating action ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/Fitch-Affirms-State-Street-Corporation-s-IDRs-at-AA-F1-Outlook-Stable-45801332/#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20A%20large,the%20IFE%20under%20business%20as)); similarly, sustained low returns (ROA or ROTE below ~1.5%) could downgrade credit ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/Fitch-Affirms-State-Street-Corporation-s-IDRs-at-AA-F1-Outlook-Stable-45801332/#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20A%20large,the%20IFE%20under%20business%20as)) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-STREET-CORPORATION-14499/news/Fitch-Affirms-State-Street-Corporation-s-IDRs-at-AA-F1-Outlook-Stable-45801332/#:~:text=profit%20to%20risk,the%20VR%20and%20LT%20IDRs)).  Our base case assumes no severe market collapse, but equity markets or rates volatility could reduce fee income.  

• **Macroeconomic pressures** – Lower interest rates or a sharp economic slowdown would compress net interest margin on excess deposits and could reduce trading/FX service revenues.  Rising inflation and higher deposit costs (post-FDIC surcharges) may pressure margins if not offset by asset yields.  

• **Competition and technology** – Intense competition from other custodians (BNY Mellon, Fidelity, etc.), mega-banks, and emerging fintech/blockchain platforms could compress fees.  State Street’s global scale and tech edge (Alpha) mitigate this, but any failure to innovate or pricing pressure on services could risk market share.  Cybersecurity/data risk is inherently high: a major data breach or operational outage could harm client trust.  

• **Geopolitical/Policy** – Global footprint exposes STT to macro shocks (e.g. trade wars, sanctions) that might disrupt cross-border flows.  Currency fluctuations and regional political risks (e.g. pension reforms) could also impact asset servicing volumes.  (However, STT’s diverse client base and regulatory compliance are strengths here.)  

# Company Description  
State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is a leading provider of financial services for institutional investors.  Its core businesses are Investment Servicing (custody, fund accounting, transfer agency, and compliance services) and Investment Management (primarily via State Street Global Advisors, including SPDR ETFs).  As of Dec. 31, 2024, State Street serviced $46.6 trillion in Assets Under Custody/Administration and managed $4.7 trillion in assets ([investors.statestreet.com](https://investors.statestreet.com/investor-news-events/press-releases/news-details/2025/State-Street-Corporation-NYSE-STT-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=State%20Street%20Corporation%20,com)).  Headquartered in Boston with ~53,000 employees worldwide, the firm also provides research, trading, and treasury services.  Its global platform and technology (e.g. the State Street Alpha platform) enable cross-border investment support across equity, fixed income, FX, and alternative asset classes.  

# Valuation  
We derive a 12-month target of **$110** using a forward multiple approach.  This implies ~13× our FY2026 EPS (~$8.50) and is roughly in line with the mid-point of peer valuations.  For example, BNY Mellon currently trades around 10–11× 2025E EPS, and Northern Trust ~9–10× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BK/BK/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=2024%20%20,%244.14)) ([m.macrotrends.net](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NTRS/northern-trust/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,year)).  Goldman Sachs and Evercore targets on STT suggest ~15× booked calendar EPS (Evercore’s $117 target and Goldman’s $109) to 2025 earnings.  Our target P/E (13×) is modestly above STT’s own last dozen-year historical average (roughly 12×) and reflects a slight premium for its reliably high capital returns.  

On an EV/Sales basis, our target (~1.4× FY2025 revenue) is roughly in line with historical range (1.2–1.5×).  Compared with history, this target assumes a normalizing equity market and continued fee expansion.  Upside catalysts include stronger-than-expected asset flows or interest income (which would lift actual EPS and justify higher multiples).  Downside risks (beyond those noted) would be any surprise earnings shortfall–e.g. significant margin erosion or lower volumes–that could push the P/E multiple down toward the low-10s.  

**Rating Change Triggers:**  An upgrade to BUY would require evidence of sustained above-trend growth (e.g. new market share wins or higher margins than expected).  A downgrade to HOLD/SELL would be triggered by significantly weaker-than-expected fee/income trends or loss of capital returns (e.g. dividend cut).  

# Ratings Reference  
**Argus Rating Definitions:**  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
- **HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  

Current 12-mo Rating: **BUY** (High conviction); Argus Five-Year Stance: **Favorable** (Long-term positive bias); Sector Stance: **Modestly Overweight Financials**.  

# Methodology & Disclaimers  
This report combines top-down and bottom-up analysis.  We start with industry outlook (macroeconomic trends, financial sector dynamics) and estimate STT’s addressable market growth (e.g. global AUC expansion, fee schedules).  We then build a bottoms-up model of income and cash flows, considering business drivers (asset trends, pricing, expense discipline).  Key factors include revenue growth, operating leverage, capital ratios, and management execution.  Valuation is determined by comparing STT’s fundamentals and multiples to peers and to its own history.  We also assess company-specific strengths and risks (liquidity, credit metrics, regulatory environment).

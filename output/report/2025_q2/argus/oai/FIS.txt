# Analyst’s Notes  

• **Strong Q1 results.** 1Q25 revenue was ~$2.5B (+3% GAAP, +4% adj.) and Adj. EPS $1.21 (+11% yoy) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,1)), driven by broad recurring services. Recurring revenue grew ~4% sequentially. High growth in Banking and Payments pipelines underpinned the results.  
• **Solid profitability and cash generation.** Adjusted EBITDA margin held near 38%; sequential margin dip (–142 bps) reflects a high license/termination fee base last year ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,1)). 1Q free-cash conversion exceeded 70% of revenue, a healthy start to the year (providing confidence on full-year FCF).   
• **Aggressive capital return.** The company repurchased $450M of stock in Q1 and returned ~$670M to shareholders (including dividends) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,1)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689325000014/fis-20241231.htm#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Board,We%20currently%20expect%20to)). Management reiterated a $1.2B buyback goal for FY25 (following ~$4.0B in 2024) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth)). Dividend was raised to $0.40/share (annualized $1.60) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689325000014/fis-20241231.htm#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Board,We%20currently%20expect%20to)).   
• **Guidance reaffirmed.** FIS reiterated its full-year 2025 outlook. 1Q results were slightly above expectations, and management confirmed mid-single-digit revenue growth with ~9-11% Adj. EPS growth (outlook $5.70–5.80) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=match%20at%20L190%20Adjusted%20EPS,GAAP%20estimates%20on%20a)). No guide cut was announced.  
• **Solid sales pipeline.** After a “record year” of core banking system wins in 2024, management notes continued strong demand across its money-movement platform. Large new bank contracts (e.g., a ~$15B-asset bank selecting FIS core) and cross-sell of payments solutions are poised to fuel growth.   
• **Outlook visibility.** Earlier client project delays are now resolved, and management sees no material macro headwinds affecting implementations. The healthy backlog and new deal momentum leave the team confident in meeting the FY outlook.

# Investment Thesis  

FIS is well positioned to capitalize on secular growth in digital finance.  Its platform spans the full *money-movement lifecycle* – from issuing (card processing, consumer lending) to acquiring (merchant payment processing via Worldpay JV) to banking software (core systems, treasury) and value-added services (fraud detection, analytics, compliance).  These markets are expanding rapidly: for example, global digital transaction volume is forecast to grow mid-high single digits annually.  Crucially, FIS’s revenue is highly recurring (roughly 80% of total), providing stability as banks and retailers subscribe to cloud-based services.  Management emphasizes this “durable business model underpinned by high recurring revenue,” which should deliver consistent results across cycles.  

Financially, FIS generates robust free cash flow.  In FY2024 it converted ~82% of net income into FCF (~$1.8B▸revenue ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=As%20of%C2%A0December%2031%2C%202024%2C%20debt,0%20billion%20of%20share%20repurchases))) and returned $4.8B to investors (share buybacks + dividends) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth)).  The board has signaled that cash will continue to flow back: dividend was recently hiked to $0.40/Q ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689325000014/fis-20241231.htm#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Board,We%20currently%20expect%20to)), and a $1.2B repurchase is planned for 2025.  This cash discipline supports steady earnings per share growth even on moderate revenue gains.  FIS targets roughly 35% payout ratio of adjusted earnings.  The balance sheet is investment-grade but leveraged (≈$11.3B debt ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=As%20of%C2%A0December%2031%2C%202024%2C%20debt,0%20billion%20of%20share%20repurchases)) vs. ~$0.8B cash), so proceeds from the announced Worldpay stake sale (≈$6.6B expected) will strengthen financial flexibility and accelerate buybacks.  

Near-term catalysts include continued growth in payment processing volumes and core banking implementations. The recently announced transactions (selling the remaining Worldpay stake and acquiring Global Payments’ issuer-processing unit) are expected to close in early 2026 ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=%2A%20Reiterates%20full,and%20other%20customary%20closing%20conditions)), de-risking a major asset sale and enhancing FIS’s issuer-services portfolio.  These deals (~10% of market cap combined) should improve profit margins and EPS going forward.  If FIS can maintain double-digit EPS growth while trading at mid-teens multiple, shares could re-rate. 

# Recent Developments  

• **May 6, 2025:** FIS reported 1Q25 results. Revenue was $2.5B (+4% adj.), and Adj. EPS was $1.21 (+11% yoy) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,1)). Management reiterated FY25 guidance (Adj. EPS ~$5.70–$5.80, implying ~10% growth) ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=match%20at%20L190%20Adjusted%20EPS,GAAP%20estimates%20on%20a)).  
• **Apr 17, 2025:** Announced strategic transactions: sale of the remaining 45% Worldpay stake (for ~$6.6B pre-tax proceeds) and simultaneous acquisition of Global Payments’ Issuer Solutions business. These moves (pending regulatory approval) are expected to close in H1 2026 ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=%2A%20Reiterates%20full,and%20other%20customary%20closing%20conditions)), transforming the corporate and bank payment portfolios.  
• **Jan 2025:** Board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.40/share (annualized $1.60) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689325000014/fis-20241231.htm#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Board,We%20currently%20expect%20to)). The company has declared consistent dividends and plans a $1.2B share buyback for 2025 ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth)) (up from $1.0B repurchased in 4Q24).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  

FIS’s recent results reflect solid volume growth in core segments.  On a continuing-ops basis, FY2024 revenue was ~$10.1B (+4% adj. vs prior year ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=%2A%20Full,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth))).  For context, FY2022 revenue was ~$9.7B and FY2023 was ~$9.8B ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2023-results-introduces-2024-outlook/#:~:text=%7C%20%20%7C%203,1.01)).  Growth has been broad-based: Banking Solutions (core banking, lending) and Merchant Solutions (processing) each contributed.  The non-recurring / license mix has normalized after a high-licensing 2023, so year-over-year comparisons will show both recurring revenue rises and lumpiness.  

Profitability is rising toward management’s targets.  FY2024 Adj. EBITDA margin was in the low 40%s, modestly above 2023.  Q1’25 margin was ~37.8% ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,1)) (down ~1.4pp vs. Q1’24 due to fewer large license fees in base).  Management expects operating leverage to return as revenue growth compounds and cost initiatives (the “Future Forward” program) continue.  FY2025 bottom line will benefit from higher recurring SaaS fees and cross-sell, partly offset by investments in technology.  Adjusted EPS jumped 56% to $5.22 in 2024 ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=%2A%20Full,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth)), aided by prior credit for costs; 2025 consensus ($5.7–5.8) implies ~9–11% EPS rise, driven by the moderately higher revenue base and continued share buybacks. 

The table below summarizes revenue and EPS trends (continuing ops):

|                  | **FY2022** | **FY2023** | **FY2024** | **Q1’25**  |
|------------------|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|----------:|
| **Revenue ($B)** |       9.7  |       9.8  |      10.1  |     2.5  |
| **Adj. EPS ($)** |       3.78 |       3.37 |       5.22 |    1.21  |

# Peer & Industry Analysis  

Peers include Fiserv (NASDAQ:FI), Global Payments (GPN), Jack Henry (JKHY), and other fintech enablers.  These companies share exposure to payment volumes and banking IT.  Fiserv’s 1Q25 results featured 5% revenue growth and ~14% EPS growth ([investors.fiserv.com](https://investors.fiserv.com/newsroom/detail/2839/fiserv-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=GAAP%20revenue%20growth%20of%205,to%2017)), with FY24 guidance of +15–17% EPS.  Global Payments reported flat GAAP revenue and +11% constant-currency EPS (excl. stock comp) for 1Q25 ([investors.globalpayments.com](https://investors.globalpayments.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/471/global-payments-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,Reaffirms%20outlook%20for%202025)).  Jack Henry (core banking) is growing mid-single digits, with higher margins but a smaller base.  

| **Company**        | **Mkt Cap** | **EPS (FY25E) Growth** | **Fwd P/E** | **Adj. EBITDA Margin** | **Our Rating** |
|--------------------|-----------:|-----------------------:|------------:|-----------------------:|---------------|
| Fidelity Nat’l Info Services (FIS) | $45B      | ~10%                    | ~14x      | ~38%                  | BUY           |
| Fiserv, Inc. (FI)                   | $69B      | ~15%                    | ~15x      | ~36%                  | HOLD          |
| Global Payments, Inc. (GPN)         | $30B      | ~11%                    | ~16x      | ~40%                  | NEUTRAL       |

*Data illustrative. Fiserv and GPN Q1’25 stats from quarterly reports ([investors.fiserv.com](https://investors.fiserv.com/newsroom/detail/2839/fiserv-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=GAAP%20revenue%20growth%20of%205,to%2017)) ([investors.globalpayments.com](https://investors.globalpayments.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/471/global-payments-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,Reaffirms%20outlook%20for%202025)).*  

FIS falls between “value” and “growth” peers.  Its multiple (~14x) is on the lower end of fintech comps despite double-digit EPS growth.  Fiserv and GPN trade in the mid-teens P/E but have similar merchant networks.  Jack Henry’s high P/E reflects its smaller scale.  On a growth/value spectrum, FIS offers steadier fundamentals (high recurring revenue) than high-growth pure-play tech firms, but with more upside than a mature banking vendor.  We see it as a balance of growth and income.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  

FIS’s balance sheet is investment-grade but levered.  At December 31, 2024, total debt was $11.3B ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=As%20of%C2%A0December%2031%2C%202024%2C%20debt,0%20billion%20of%20share%20repurchases)) versus ~$0.8B cash ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,109)), for net debt ≈$10.5B.  Given $1.8B in 2024 free cash flow ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=As%20of%C2%A0December%2031%2C%202024%2C%20debt,0%20billion%20of%20share%20repurchases)), net debt/EBITDA is roughly 3x.  On April 17, sale of the remaining Worldpay stake (~$6.6B) will sharply cut leverage (with proceeds expected mid-2026).  The company has ample liquidity: undrawn credit lines (> $1B) and an unsecured bond profile (mixed maturities).  FIS maintains an ~35% dividend payout policy.  The current quarterly dividend is $0.40 (annual yield ~2.3%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1136893/000113689325000014/fis-20241231.htm#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Board,We%20currently%20expect%20to)), and share repurchases have been a larger component of returns ($4.0B repurchased in 2024 ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-full-year-2024-results-and-2025-outlook-confirms/#:~:text=,outlook%20including%20accelerated%20revenue%20growth))).  The steady buyback program is expected to continue, gradually reducing share count.  **Financial Strength Rating:** Medium – solid cash flow cover for interest, but high net debt (partly mitigated by upcoming asset sale) suggests moderate risk.

# Management & Risks  

CEO Stephanie Ferris (since 2020) and CFO James Kyo (appointed in 2023) have overseen FIS through transformational change (Worldpay spin-off). The management team is experienced in fintech, but integration of new deals and technology investments remain execution risks. 

Key risks include:  
• **Regulatory/Legislative:** New laws (privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, AI governance, banking regulation) could increase compliance costs or limit product offerings ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=match%20at%20L307%20,cyber%20resilience%20and%20AI%20laws)). Payment systems are also affected by monetary policies, tariffs, and trade tensions ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=,and%20political%20conditions%2C%20a%20recession)).  
• **Consolidation and competition:** Customer-driven consolidation in banking or retail can reduce new deal opportunities ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=match%20at%20L314%20,by%20firms%20in%20those%20industries)). Large banks and global tech firms may unbundle payments services, weakening FIS’s bundled solutions. Competition from cloud fintechs and big-tech entrants is intensifying.  
• **Technology/Cyber:** FIS depends on secure, reliable IT platforms. Cyberattacks, major outages or data breaches (especially given recent industry incidents) could damage clients and trigger liability. Maintaining resilience and privacy standards is critical ([www.investor.fisglobal.com](https://www.investor.fisglobal.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fis-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-and-reiterates/#:~:text=match%20at%20L343%20,AI%20technologies%20into%20our%20business)).  
• **Macro/Economic:** Economic slowdowns or high inflation may force financial institutions and retailers to defer tech spending, impacting license and transaction growth.  Rising interest rates could pressure fintech valuations and financing costs (though interest exposure is modest).  
• **Geopolitical:** Global operations (servicing clients in North America, Europe, APAC) expose FIS to geopolitical tensions, sanctions, or currency fluctuations. Changes in world trade or instability can affect cross-border payment volumes and project timelines.

# Company Description  

FIS is a global provider of financial technology and services.  It offers end-to-end payment processing, banking software, and financial services solutions.  The company handles credit/debit card issuance and processing, electronic banking, merchant acquiring and point-of-sale systems, as well as risk management and compliance services for banks, credit unions, retailers and corporations ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/ZGY%3AGR#:~:text=Fidelity%20National%20Information%20Services%2C%20Inc,to%20financial%20institutions%20and%20merchants)).  FIS’s product suite spans merchant processing (through Worldpay connections), core banking platforms for lenders and depositories, and other services (e.g. treasury, analytics, cross-border payments), serving thousands of customers worldwide.

# Valuation  

We value FIS using a forward multiple approach anchored to peers.  Our 12-month target of $95 implies ~16× FY2026E EPS (bridging FY25–26), roughly in line with the long-term peer median.  This multiple is slightly above FIS’s current ~14× run-rate EPS, reflecting expected margin expansion and deal synergies.  For reference, Fiserv and Global Payments trade in the mid-teens P/E on similar growth profiles ([investors.fiserv.com](https://investors.fiserv.com/newsroom/detail/2839/fiserv-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=GAAP%20revenue%20growth%20of%205,to%2017)) ([investors.globalpayments.com](https://investors.globalpayments.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/471/global-payments-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,Reaffirms%20outlook%20for%202025)).  Historically, FIS has traded around 15–17× P/E in stronger markets, so our target evens out volatility.  

**Upside drivers:** Execution of new client wins, successful integration of the issuer business, or further efficiency gains could support a higher multiple. A larger-than-expected accretion from the Worldpay stake sale could also boost equity value.  

**Downside risks:** A severe macro recession or major technology outage could compress earnings and multiples. If regulatory hurdles delay the announced transactions or dampen demand for digitization, the stock could slip to mid-teens P/E or below. A sustained shortfall against guidance would also prompt a rating review.

# Ratings Reference  

**BUY:** We expect relative outperformance versus the broad market (S&P 500 benchmark) over 12 months. Buying and holding should deliver above-index total returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  
**HOLD:** We expect performance in line with the market.  Moderate long-term returns, but sensitive to risk factors.  
**SELL:** We expect underperformance relative to the market over 12 months.  

*Our long-term (≥5-yr) stance on FIS is Positive (reflecting secular fintech growth), and we remain Overweight on the Fintech sector.*

# Methodology & Disclaimers

We assess industry trends (payments growth, banking digitization), then analyze company fundamentals (revenue drivers, cost structure, cash flow, balance sheet).  We evaluate management track record, corporate strategy and capital allocation, and factor in risks (regulatory, competitive, macro).  Valuation is based on peer multiples and intrinsic cash-flow models. This report does not constitute investment advice or an offer to sell securities. Our opinions are for informational purposes; investors should consider whether our analysis aligns with their own financial goals and risk profile.

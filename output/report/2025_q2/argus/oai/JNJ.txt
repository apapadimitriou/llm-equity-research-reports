## Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1 2025 results**: Sales $21.89B (+2.4% y/y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=healthcare%20giant%20reported%20adjusted%20earnings,acquisition%20of%20schizophrenia%20drug%20Caplyta)), led by pharmaceuticals; pharma sales $13.87B (vs. $13.33B prior), MedTech $8.02B (+2.5% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=About%20%24400%20million%20in%20tariff,due%20to))).

Oncology drove growth (Darzalex +20% to $3.24B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=2025%20earnings%2C%20driven%20by%20strong,4))). Stelara sales plunged on biosim competition, partially offset by acquisitions (Caplyta to be added).

At guidance midpoint, EPS growth is ~8.7% ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Company%20issues%20guidance%20for,point)). Tariff headwinds expected: CFO forecasts ~$400M tariff costs in 2025 (MedTech-heavy) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/103d0074599788cf6f3ceee93269c3d2#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20anticipates%20incurring,Importantly%2C%20the%20estimate)).

• **Portfolio drivers**: Strength from key franchises (e.g. Darzalex, RYBREVANT in oncology) ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Significant%20pipeline%20progress%20including,)) and ongoing R&D (neuroscience, immunology). New deals: agreed to acquire Intra-Cellular (*Caplyta*) for $14.6B to bolster CNS psychiatry lineup ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/19160ba4559aaab40836078d12a89800#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20investing,Cellular)). MedTech remains solid with demand in ortho and surgery. Dividends remain healthy ($4.96 annualized ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-62nd-Consecutive-Year-of-Dividend-Increase-Raises-Quarterly-Dividend-by-4.2/#:~:text=At%20the%20new%20rate%2C%20the,the%20close%20of%20business%20on))) and share count is down ~6% since 2022 on buybacks.

• **Thesis update**: J&J’s defensive growth via steady pharma/MedTech cash flow and pipeline innovation remains intact. Improved capital allocation (Kenvue spin-off proceeds deployed to core) and U.S. manufacturing investment support confidence. Regulatory (drug pricing, trade) and legal (talc litigation) risks require monitoring, but earnings durability is high.  

## Investment Thesis  
Johnson & Johnson is a diversified healthcare leader with durable free cash flow and a fortress balance sheet. Secular drivers include aging demographics and chronic disease prevalence, giving long-term tailwinds to J&J’s large addressable markets in cancer, immunology, neuroscience and advanced surgery. The company combines consumer medtech brands (DePuy, Ethicon, etc.) with the Janssen drug portfolio – generating >70% gross margins in pharma.  

Its pipeline is robust: recent data from RYBREVANT (lung cancer) and new modalities (e.g. robotic surgery *OTTAVA*) point to future growth ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Significant%20pipeline%20progress%20including,)). The Caplyta acquisition ($14.6B) adds a fast-growing psychiatric franchise ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/19160ba4559aaab40836078d12a89800#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20investing,Cellular)). J&J boasts industry-leading FCF conversion (operating CFO to net income) thanks to tight cost control, supporting 3%+ annual dividend hikes and opportunistic buybacks.  

Near-term catalysts include pipeline readouts and regulatory approvals (e.g. Supplemental New Drug Applications), deal closures (Caplyta), and tariff/legal resolution. With FY2025 sales growth guide ~3–4% and EPS GROWTH ~9% ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Company%20issues%20guidance%20for,point)), J&J appears poised for modest multi-year growth. The firm’s broad portfolio and market share insulation enable it to withstand biosimilar skews (e.g. Stelara decline) by rotating to newer assets.  

## Recent Developments  
- **Q4/FY2024 results** (announced Jan 22, 2025): Q4 sales $22.5B (+5.3%), adjusted EPS $2.04 ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%202024%20Fourth,98)) (reported EPS $1.41 including one-time charges).

Excludes COVID vaccine (for modeling).  
- **Pipeline progress**: Announced significant R&D advances – e.g. positive survival data for RYBREVANT combination, initiation of TAR-200 (urolo-genital) trials, and new approvals for investigational systems (OTTAVA) ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Significant%20pipeline%20progress%20including,)).  
- **Deal activity**: Jan 2025 – agreed to buy Intra-Cellular for $14.6B (Caplyta), pending approval ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/19160ba4559aaab40836078d12a89800#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20investing,Cellular)). May 2024 – sold remaining 9.5% stake in spinoff Kenvue for ~$3.75B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/jj-sell-all-shares-spun-off-unit-kenvue-2024-05-13/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,its%20pharmaceutical%20and%20medical%20devices)) (refocus on pharma/MedTech).  
- **Trade/tariffs**: CFO Wolk forecasts ~$400M in 2025 tariff costs (mainly MedTech) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/103d0074599788cf6f3ceee93269c3d2#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20anticipates%20incurring,Importantly%2C%20the%20estimate)). CEO Duato warned that any new pharma tariffs could disrupt supply chains and cause drug shortages ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/103d0074599788cf6f3ceee93269c3d2#:~:text=excludes%20possible%20tariffs%20on%20pharmaceutical,occurs%20domestically)). JNJ responded by accelerating US manufacturing (>$55B investment plan).  
- **Capital returns**: Jan 2025 – declared Q1’25 dividend $1.24 (payable Mar 2025) ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2025/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-Quarterly-Dividend-for-First-Quarter-2025/default.aspx#:~:text=NEW%20BRUNSWICK%2C%20N.J.,date%20is%20February%2018%2C%202025)), sustaining 62nd year of annual increase; annualized $4.96. ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-62nd-Consecutive-Year-of-Dividend-Increase-Raises-Quarterly-Dividend-by-4.2/#:~:text=At%20the%20new%20rate%2C%20the,the%20close%20of%20business%20on)).  
- **Legal/Regulatory**: Apr 2025 – Bankruptcy judge rejected J&J’s $10B talc settlement plan ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-shares-fall-after-judge-rejects-10-billion-talc-settlement-2025-04-01/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%27s%20shares%20fell,traditional%20legal%20system%20to%20fight)). Litigation risk remains significant. Other risks: pending biosimilar competition for Stelara (already cutting sales) and evolving drug-pricing policies.  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue should see mid-single-digit growth in FY2025. Guidance implies ~3% operational growth (reflecting baseline 7% core growth when ex-COVID vaccines ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%202024%20Full,98))). Pharma growth is driven by oncology and immunology launches (Darzalex +20% in Q1 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=2025%20earnings%2C%20driven%20by%20strong,4))) and by recent acquisitions; MedTech is growing low- to mid-single digits, slightly pressured by tariffs and elective procedure trends. Operating leverage is modest: R&D and depreciation keep expense leverage restrained.  

EPS is bridging higher mainly via higher sales and share reductions. At mid-FY25, guidance implies ~8.7% EPS lift ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Company%20issues%20guidance%20for,point)). Bridge factors: + volume/price, + one-time R&D benefit dilution of ~$0.67 in 2024 (not repeated), + share buybacks, partially offset by +tariff/dilution from Caplyta deal. Q1 2025 EPS ($2.77 adj.) was up ~7% y/y ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,4)), reflecting similar dynamics.

*Source: Market cap and current P/E from MacroTrends (as of early 2025) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JNJ/johnson-johnson/market-cap#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,13.06)). Estimated EPS growth (%). Johns­on & Johnson (mkt cap ~$400B) trades at ~15× FY2025EPS, near sector median.  

JNJ is more of a “value”/defensive long-duration stock compared to high-growth peers (e.g. LLY) but trades at a premium to cyclical pharma (PFE, MERCK). It sits middle-of-pack on the Value–Growth spectrum: stable, moderate growth (~5–8% EPS CAGR) with above-average quality and dividend, versus peers like Lilly (growth) or Pfizer (value). 

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
J&J’s balance sheet is robust. Cash and liquid securities totaled ~$24.5B at end-2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=billion,the%20end%20of%202024%20was)), against $36.6B total debt (net debt ~$12.1B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20has%20access%20to,of%20funds%20at%20numerous%20banks)) (debt ≈34% of capital). Debt/Equity is low (~0.5), and conservative liquidity (260% short-term debt coverage). Operating cash flow was $24.3B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Cash%20flow%20from%20operations%20of,3%C2%A0billion%20was%20the%20result%20of)), supporting durable access to capital. We assign a **High** Financial Strength rating (AA/AAA credit).  

Dividend policy: J&J has raised its dividend annually for 62+ years, most recently +4.2% in Apr-2024 ([www.investor.jnj.com](https://www.investor.jnj.com/news/news-details/2024/Johnson--Johnson-Announces-62nd-Consecutive-Year-of-Dividend-Increase-Raises-Quarterly-Dividend-by-4.2/#:~:text=announced%20that%20its%20Board%20of,nd%7D%20year%20of%20consecutive%20increases)). The $1.24/Q1 rate (annualized $4.96) yields ~3%. Share repurchases are opportunistic but not massive recently (2024 net ~$2.4B buybacks ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Net%20earnings%20%20,2%2C389))). We expect continued small buybacks and steady dividend growth.  

## Management & Risks  
CEO Joaquin Duato (since 2022) and CFO Joseph Wolk (since 2020) head a stable management team with strong succession planning. Disclosure is solid; J&J typically meets or slightly beats consensus. Key risk factors: *Regulatory/Policy* – U.S. drug pricing reforms or new tariffs on pharma could pressure margins; CFO cited $400M+ in 2025 tariff costs ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/103d0074599788cf6f3ceee93269c3d2#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20anticipates%20incurring,Importantly%2C%20the%20estimate)). *Litigation* – ongoing talcum powder lawsuits (judge recently rejected a $10B settlement ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-shares-fall-after-judge-rejects-10-billion-talc-settlement-2025-04-01/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%27s%20shares%20fell,traditional%20legal%20system%20to%20fight))) pose uncertain liabilities. *Competition* – biosimilar/generic erosion (e.g. Stelara down ~33% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=device%20segment%2C%20reflecting%20current%20U,due%20to))) and aggressive pricing by rivals. *Macro* – global growth slowdown may dampen Rx demand and elective procedures. Adverse currency moves or supply disruptions (as cautioned by management) are additional concerns.  

## Company Description  
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global healthcare conglomerate (founded 1886) focused on pharmaceuticals and medical technology ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/jj-sell-all-shares-spun-off-unit-kenvue-2024-05-13/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,its%20pharmaceutical%20and%20medical%20devices)). Its Innovative Medicine segment (Janssen) develops drugs across oncology, immunology, neuroscience and infectious diseases; leading products include Darzalex, Stelara (IBD/psoriasis), Xarelto, and others. The MedTech segment spans orthopedics (DePuy Synthes), surgery (Ethicon/OmniGuide), interventional solutions and vision care. (The Consumer health business – brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid – was spun off into Kenvue in 2023 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/jj-sell-all-shares-spun-off-unit-kenvue-2024-05-13/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,its%20pharmaceutical%20and%20medical%20devices)).) J&J sells products worldwide (175+ countries) and is known for broad R&D pipelines and integrated healthcare solutions.  

## Valuation  
We derive our 12-mo target via a multiples approach. At ~164 and FY2025 EPS ≈$10.85, J&J trades at ~15×; our target ~$180 implies ~17×. This premium to FY2024/2025 peer averages (AbbVie ~$18×, Merck ~10×, Novartis ~13× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JNJ/johnson-johnson/market-cap#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20,13.06))) reflects J&J’s superior diversified portfolio and cash-flow stability. Historically, JNJ’s P/E has ranged mid-teens. A 17× target is slightly above its 5-year mean (~15×) but justified by strong guidance (+8.7% EPS growth ([www.jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-reports-q4-2024-and-full-year-2024-results#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Company%20issues%20guidance%20for,point))) and buybacks. If growth accelerates (e.g. major drug approvals), upside could exceed(~+10%). Downside risks (tariffs, litigation) could cap valuation contraction. Our target thus balances moderate upside with this stable base.  

*What would change our rating*: A materially better pipeline outcome (e.g. blockbusters far exceeding sales or faster cost cuts) would tilt upside, upgrading to **Overweight**. Conversely, sharper guidance cuts, tariff surprises, or a large litigation charge would swipe away the cushion, warranting a **Hold**.  

## Ratings Reference  
**BUY** – Expected to outperform broad market indices on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
**HOLD** – Expected to perform roughly in line with the market.  
**SELL** – Expected to underperform or decline relative to the market.  

*12-month rating: BUY; 5-year view: Moderately Positive; Sector stance: Market Weight.*  

## Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis combines a top-down industry outlook (healthcare trends, macro factors) with a bottom-up financial review (segment growth, margins, balance sheet). We evaluate product pipelines, competitive positioning, management credibility, and valuation relative to peers. Forecasts are based on company guidance, consensus data, and our proprietary projections. Valuation reflects both multiples of earnings/cash flow and, where appropriate, discounted cash flow considerations. *Disclaimer:* This report is educational in nature and not a recommendation to buy or sell any security.

# Analyst’s Notes
• **Q1’25 results vs. Q1’24:** Net revenues $15.06B (+6% YoY) and net income $4.74B (+15% YoY), EPS $14.12 (+22%) ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-04-14-q1-results#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2014%2C%202025,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202025)) ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2024/2024-04-15-q1-results.html#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20April%2015%2C%202024%C2%A0%E2%80%93,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024)). Global Banking & Markets drove growth, with equities trading net revenue $4.20B (+27% YoY) and FICC trading $4.39B (+2%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to%20%241.9%20billion%20due)). Investment banking fees dipped 8% to $1.91B (weak IPO/M&A market) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=billion%20%28%2414,markets%2C%20influenced%20by%20economic%20uncertainty)). Asset & Wealth Management revenue was $3.68B (-3% YoY) as AUM rose to a record $3.17T ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=and%20trade%20tensions,17%20trillion)).  
• **Expenses & Efficiency:** Operating costs rose ~5% YoY to $9.13B, yielding an efficiency ratio ~60.6% (vs 60.9% last year) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=Operating%20Expenses)). Compensation and transaction expenses increased with performance, partly offset by a decline in funding costs. We expect FY25 efficiency ~60–62%. Credit loss provision $287M in Q1.  
• **Capital Return:** Aggressive buybacks bolster EPS: $4.36B repurchased in Q1 (≈7.1M shares, avg $610) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=including%20%244,3)). Board authorized up to $40B in repurchases. Quarterly dividend maintained at $3.00 ($12 annual) ([www.modernreaders.com](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2025/01/18/the-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-to-go-ex-dividend-on-february-28th.html#:~:text=Friday%2C%20February%2028th%20will%20be,dividend%20is%20Friday%2C%20February%2028th)); 13-year dividend growth streak intact. Tangible book rose to $344.20 by Q1 (+2.2% QoQ) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=,)).  
• **Outlook/Guide:** CEO Solomon noted a “markedly different” Q2 market but expressed confidence in client demand ([www.goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pressroom/press-releases/2025/2025-04-14-q1-results#:~:text=David%20Solomon%2C%20Chairman%20and%20CEO,%E2%80%9D)). We view GS’s well-hedged mix (IB + Trading + AUM) as a cushion against industry cyclicality. Management signals disciplined cost control (limited hiring, potential cuts) and prudent RWA/ capital planning.

# Investment Thesis
Goldman Sachs benefits from secular growth in global capital markets and wealth/investment management. Its core **Global Banking & Markets** (trading, underwriting) franchises capture volatility-driven flows—trading revenues jumped due to tariff-fueled uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to%20%241.9%20billion%20due)). The **Asset & Wealth Management** segment provides recurring fee income; record AUM (~$3.2T) should grow with inflows and rising markets. Consumer/Platform Solutions (Marcus, Apple Card) adds deposit funding and potential cross-selling value. Across cycles, GS’s high operating leverage amplifies revenue gains: with revenue up 16% in 2024, operating leverage drove net earnings (+68%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000088698225000005/gs-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,10%2C764)). 

Strong free cash flow funds capital return. Management has returned ~$11.8B in 2024 (including $8.0B buybacks) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000088698225000005/gs-20241231.htm#:~:text=divided%20by%20total%20net%20revenues,for%202023)) and continues ~2% dividend yield ([www.modernreaders.com](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2025/01/18/the-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-to-go-ex-dividend-on-february-28th.html#:~:text=Friday%2C%20February%2028th%20will%20be,dividend%20is%20Friday%2C%20February%2028th)). The firm’s buyback program ($40B authorization) underpins our EPS outlook. Near-term catalysts include a moderate pickup in M&A/capital markets activity (as pipelines remain robust despite macro headwinds) and continued efficiency gains. GS’s diversified platform – elite IPO/M&A advisory, leading equities/fixed-income trading, and growing wealth management – creates multiple monetization streams. Even as consumer banking disappointments (e.g. Apple Card issues) temper one area, the overall franchise durability remains high. The stock trades at a modest premium to book and below Morgan Stanley’s P/E ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/market-cap#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,34.03)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/pe-ratio#:~:text=2024,16.34)), implying upside if markets normalize.

- **Oct 23, 2024:** CFPB fined Goldman $64.8M (with Apple paying $25M) over Apple Card consumer complaints ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-watchdog-agency-orders-goldman-sachs-apple-pay-89-million-over-consumer-2024-10-23/#:~:text=The%20U,Both%20companies)). New card issuance paused pending compliance.  
- **Regulatory/Pipeline:** GSAM’s private credit initiative grew ($130→$300B target) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-seeks-expand-private-credit-portfolio-300-billion-five-years-2024-03-12/#:~:text=2024,views%20private%20credit%20as%20a)); latest Fed stress result (July 2025) approved healthy dividend payout/higher buffer.  
- **Industry Context:** Goldman warned that broad U.S. tariffs pose a “growth shock” to markets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-tariffs-threaten-growth-shock-goldman-sachs-says-2025-04-03/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20warned%20that,that%20will)), underscoring its focus on trading and risk management in revenue mix. 

# Earnings & Growth Analysis
Goldman’s top-line is driven by fees (IB), trading gains (FICC/Equities), and asset-management fees. In recent years, volatile markets and robust debt underwriting lifted net revenues growth (FY2022–24: +12%, +16%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000088698225000005/gs-20241231.htm#:~:text=Net%20revenues%20%20,10%2C764)). Pressure points were dealmaking slowdowns (2023 IB fees) and consumer bank setbacks. Q1’25 saw revenue +6% YoY as equities trading offset weak advisory. Looking to FY25, we project modest revenue growth. Trading volumes may normalize after Q1 peaks, but pipeline strength could sustain bond/equity deals. We assume IB fees roughly flat, trading rev up slightly, and AUM fees up low-single digits. 

Operating leverage: Carlson forecasts imply expense growth ~5–6% (inflation/comps), keeping efficiency ratio flat at ~61%. GS has managed compensation ~35–40% of revenues historically; incentive comp should scale with net revenues. Q1’s efficiency (~60.6%) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=Operating%20Expenses)) suggests leverage is positive. With flat credit costs (current reserves cushion) and disciplined costs, we expect FY25 net income ~high-single-digit % above FY24, aided by EPS accretion from buybacks.

GS sits in the middle of the US IB/Financial sector. Its forward P/E (~14x) is slightly below major peers (e.g. MS ~16x ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/market-cap#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,34.03))) on robust EPS growth.  Its strategic focus is more growth-oriented than value banks. On a value vs. growth axis, GS is balanced: higher ROE and resurgence in deal flow lean growth, while its cyclical lending/dividend aspects impart some value characteristics. Our BUY rating vs. peers reflects belief that GS will outperform if capital markets recover faster than expected.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend
• **Balance Sheet:** Ample liquidity (cash + short investments ~$100B), low loan loss provisions. Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ~15% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=Common%20equity%20tier%201%20capital,)) (well above regulatory minimum). Debt/ equity moderate (~2:1), disciplined balance sheet. We assign **Financial Strength: Medium-High**: strong capital, sound liquidity, though regulatory capital buffers should draw scrutiny.  
• **Profitability:** Return on Equity ~18% (vs ~13% industry) in Q1. Assumes stable net interest margin on lending; trading-driven revenues reduce macro sensitivity.  
• **Dividend:** Quarterly dividend set at $3.00 ($12.00 annual) ([www.modernreaders.com](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2025/01/18/the-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-to-go-ex-dividend-on-february-28th.html#:~:text=Friday%2C%20February%2028th%20will%20be,dividend%20is%20Friday%2C%20February%2028th)). Yield ~1.9%, grown for 13 consecutive years ([www.modernreaders.com](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2025/01/18/the-goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-to-go-ex-dividend-on-february-28th.html#:~:text=The%20Goldman%20Sachs%20Group%20has,indicating)). Payout ratio ~25% of earnings – conservative by industry. We expect continued annual raises if earnings permit.  
• **Share Repurchase:** Aggressive buyback program ($40B cap) is key to our outlook. GS repurchased ~$8.0B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000088698225000005/gs-20241231.htm#:~:text=divided%20by%20total%20net%20revenues,for%202023)) and $4.36B in Q1’25 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312525079625/d750054dex991.htm#:~:text=including%20%244,3)), shrinking share count ~5% over the year. This underpins EPS growth given modest dividend.  

# Management & Risks
• **Leadership:** CEO David Solomon (since 2018) and President John Waldron are very experienced; both secured with retention incentives ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-adds-president-john-waldron-board-2025-02-26/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20appointed%20its,fees%20and%20active%20trading%20markets)). Waldron’s board appointment signals well-structured succession. CFO role saw transitions (GSAM CFO Overbay in Feb’25 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-picks-elizabeth-overbay-cfo-asset-management-business-memo-says-2025-02-27/#:~:text=2025,to%20a%20memo%20seen%20by)); global CFO duties remain).  
• **Competitive:** Intense competition across segments. Investment banks (JPM, MS) and trading boutiques vie for market share; fintech entrants challenge retail/wealth management. Fee compression in M&A underwriting versus peers is a watch item.  
• **Regulatory/Govt:** CFPB enforcement ($64.8M Apple Card fine) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-watchdog-agency-orders-goldman-sachs-apple-pay-89-million-over-consumer-2024-10-23/#:~:text=The%20U,Both%20companies)) and Fed stress tests increase scrutiny. Tariff-driven volatility ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-tariffs-threaten-growth-shock-goldman-sachs-says-2025-04-03/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20warned%20that,that%20will)) and U.S.–China tensions could suppress capital markets activity. Bank capital rules may tighten, capping buybacks/dividends.  
• **Macro:** GS is cyclical – a recession or credit crunch could sharply curtail advisory and trading revenue. Tariff policies could morph into broader “stagflation” risks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-tariffs-threaten-growth-shock-goldman-sachs-says-2025-04-03/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20has%20warned%20that,that%20will)). Interest-rate cuts (if they occur) may flatten trading and lending margins.  
• **Governance/Pay:** High executive pay has drawn shareholder criticism (e.g. unanimous $80M bonuses) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Goldman%20set%20aside%20%24287,bonuses%2C%20facing%20opposition%20from%20shareholder)). Misaligned incentives or activist challenges could emerge. GS’s consumer finance setbacks (Apple Card) illustrate operational/legal risk.  
• **Other:** Geopolitical events (e.g. Middle East conflict) may spike volatility (benefiting trading) but hurt deal volumes. Cybersecurity and clearinghouse dependencies are implicit operational risks.

# Valuation
We derive our USD 650 target via a multiples-based approach. This implies ~15x our FY26 EPS estimate, near the high end of historical P/E (5-yr avg ~12–14x) but justified by stronger ROE and reserve of buybacks. On P/B, target equals ~1.9x 2025 book (above historical ~1.3x) reflecting premium for GS’s leading franchises. Our target is in line with Morgan Stanley’s valuation (MS P/E ~16.2x ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/market-cap#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,34.03))) and modestly above Goldman’s long-term average. Upside catalysts include sustained M&A/trading growth and continued capital return; downside risks would be a sharp market downturn or prolonged investment banking weakness—scenarios that would raise doubts and could warrant a downgrade.

# Methodology & Disclaimers
Our analysis combines top-down and bottom-up research. We start with macroeconomic and industry outlook, then assess Goldman’s segments, management quality and financial strength. We perform detailed financial modeling and peer comparisons to judge valuation. Key factors include economic drivers (interest rates, deal flow), GS’s capital adequacy, and the competitive landscape. This report is based on published data and our estimates; it is not investment advice or a recommendation to buy/sell. Investors should consider multiple factors and their own risk tolerance. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and actual outcomes may differ materially.

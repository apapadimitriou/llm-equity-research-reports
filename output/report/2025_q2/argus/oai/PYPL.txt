The pivot to “profitable growth” (pricing power, cost cuts) began to pay off in late-2024/Q1’25 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPayPal%20had%20a%20strong%20finish,show%20up%20in%20our%20results)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20increased%2031,to%20%241.6%20billion)).  We expect earnings growth to asymptotically slow to ~mid-teens by 2027 (per mid-term outlook ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=consolidating%20to%20one%20platform%20to,%E2%80%9D))).  

## Investment Thesis  

PayPal is a long-established fintech with a broad digital payments network (PayPal, Venmo, Xoom, Braintree) spanning ~200 countries ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94)).  Its addressable market is the global e-commerce and digital payments ecosystem (trillions of USD) – from person-to-person remittances to merchant checkout – where “bring-your-own-payment-method” wallets are increasingly preferred.  The company’s scale (~436M accounts, 26B transactions in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A24Q%2724%20total%20payment%20volume%20,FXN%29%20to%20%241.68%20trillion)) ([www.businessofapps.com](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/paypal-statistics#:~:text=,users%20and%20merchants%20use%20PayPal))) and data (43% revenue outside U.S. ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=operations%20impacts%20the%20translation%20of,Because%20we%20generate))) underpin durable moats in cross-border and omni-channel commerce.  Importantly, PayPal is “shaping up margins” by prioritizing higher-value flows (cross-border fees, branded checkout) and rebuilding pricing (as seen in transaction dollar growth ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391724000096/pypl2q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=2Q%2724%20Financial%20Results)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A24Q%2724%20total%20payment%20volume%20,FXN%29%20to%20%241.68%20trillion))).  

Financially, PayPal generates robust free cash flow (2024 FCF ~$6.8B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A24Q%2724%20cash%20flow%20from%20operations,8%20billion))) and returns large capital to shareholders (FY’22–24 net buybacks ~$13B).  Expense discipline and lower restructuring charges have expanded operating margins to near historical highs ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20increased%2031,to%20%241.6%20billion)).  The balance sheet is healthy (>$15B cash vs ~$11B debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%2C%20and%20investments,billion%20as%20of%20December%C2%A031%2C%202024))), supporting the Medium-High Financial Strength rating.  We assume dividends will remain nil; focus is on buybacks.  

Near-term catalysts include scaling of Venmo (rapid TPV growth) and “Fastlane” one-click checkout, deeper crypto integration, and PayPal Open (a unified merchant platform from Investor Day ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=New%20Unified%20Merchant%20Offering%3A%20PayPal,Open))). Momentum in e-commerce innovation and any pickup in consumer spending could drive better-than-feared growth.  Key assumptions: global e-commerce will continue growing (offsetting macro drags) and increased monetization of value-added services.

Launched **PayPal Open** (new unified commerce platform) and expanded omnichannel partnerships: e.g. Verifone deal for integrated in-person/e-com payments ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=Strategic%20Omnichannel%20Partnership%20with%20Verifone)); Fastlane (one-click checkout) to JPMorgan’s UK/EU merchants ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=Fastlane%20Expanding%20to%20International%20Markets)).  

• **Business Restructuring:** Ongoing transition to one-payments platform (merging Venmo and PayPal infrastructures) and repricing efforts in 2024/Q1 have been highlighted by management as key to long-term regain of velocity ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPayPal%20had%20a%20strong%20finish,show%20up%20in%20our%20results)) ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=consolidating%20to%20one%20platform%20to,%E2%80%9D)).  PayPal sold its EU BNPL receivables in late-2023 (streamlining BNPL operations).  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  

Revenues have trended higher as PayPal refocused its product mix.  FY’22–24 revenues (approx.) were ~$25.4B, $29.2B, and $31.8B ([www.businessofapps.com](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/paypal-statistics#:~:text=,users%20and%20merchants%20use%20PayPal)) ([www.businessofapps.com](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/paypal-statistics/#:~:text=,completed%20on%20PayPal%20in%202024)), a ~9% CAGR (2022–24), aided by mid-single-digit cut in transaction fees giving way to fee hikes and bounce-back in volumes.  FY’24 TPV increased 10% to $1.681T ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A24Q%2724%20total%20payment%20volume%20,FXN%29%20to%20%241.68%20trillion)), with Venmo, cross-border and merchant solutions driving growth (FY23 TPV ~$1.53T).  

Profit dynamics recovered: 2022–23 GAAP EPS jumped ~73% (due partly to one-offs and volume growth) to $3.84 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PYPL/PayPal/net-income-loss#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)), and 2024 GAAP EPS was $3.99 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Transaction%20margin%20dollars%20%20,)).  Non-GAAP EPS grew faster (FY’22 ~$3.83→$4.65 in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Transaction%20margin%20dollars%20%20,))) as operating leverage kicked in.  Q1’25 built on this: Net revenue +1% (on easier comps); GAAP op. income +31% to $1.53B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000062/pypl1q-25earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2GAAP%20operating%20income%20increased%2031,to%20%241.6%20billion)).

Incentives/costs: Reducing marketing and capital spend in 2023 and 1Q’25 lowered opex growth; transaction expenses fell (–$213M Q1’25 vs prior year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=operations%20impacts%20the%20translation%20of,Because%20we%20generate))).

## Peer & Industry Analysis  

| Company    |  Mkt Cap  | 1-Yr EPS Δ | ’25 P/E  | Op. Margin | Argus Rating    |
|:-----------|----------:|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|:---------------|
| Visa (V)   | ~$480B    | +12%  FY24 | ~28×    | ~55%  | Buy            |
| Mastercard (MA)| ~$340B| + 8%  FY24 | ~24×    | ~55%  | Buy            |
| Block (SQ) | ~$ 50B    | –20%    | ~25×    | –20% (loss)| Hold           |
| Global Payments (GPN) | ~$ 50B | +10% FY24 | ~18× | 30% | Buy         |

*Peer estimates: Market caps as of Apr 2025; EPS growth and multiples per consensus. (Sources: company reports/Yahoo Finance; Argus maintains HOLD on PayPal vs peers.)*  

On a style “growth vs value” map, PayPal sits between high-PEG/developmental fintech (e.g. SQ) and the “bond-like” growth in Visa/MA.  PayPal’s own growth (~7–10% EPS CAGR) is lower than Block’s target but it trades at ~15x 2025E vs ~28x for Visa.  Thus, PayPal presents more value orientation (higher FCF yield) relative to card networks, while offering more growth runway (digital payments expansion) than legacy financials.  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  

PayPal’s balance sheet is solid.  Cash & investments were $15.4B at end-2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%2C%20and%20investments,billion%20as%20of%20December%C2%A031%2C%202024)) versus $11.1B debt (net debt ~$ –4.3B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%2C%20and%20investments,billion%20as%20of%20December%C2%A031%2C%202024)).  Working capital is ample given $39B funds receivable vs ~$41B customer payables ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,58%2C206)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=Current%20liabilities%3A%20%20,)).  The debt/leverage is modest (Debt/Equity ~0.57 by book ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=Other%20long,))) and no maturities major until 2027.  Free cash flow ($6.8B in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A24Q%2724%20cash%20flow%20from%20operations,8%20billion))) covers investments easily.  The **Financial Strength** rating is *Medium-High* (ample liquidity, investment-grade profile).  

PayPal currently **pays no dividend** (yield 0%), focusing on buybacks.  We expect significant share count reduction to continue – ~92M shares (~9%) bought in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2Returned%20%241,of%20common%20stock%20in%204Q%2724)), then about 2% more in Q1.  Absent a policy change, the share count trajectory is downward through 2025.  (Dividend increases are not expected based on guidance; we flag here as risk if cash flow were needed for coverage.)  

## Management & Risks  

CEO **Alex Chriss** (former Braintree exec) took over in 2023  ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPayPal%20had%20a%20strong%20finish,show%20up%20in%20our%20results)), and CFO **Jamie Miller** joined in 2024.  Management has been visibly “boots-on-the-ground” at investor events (e.g. Feb 2025 Investor Day) and is transparent about goals (e.g. medium-term metrics ([newsroom.paypal-corp.com](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-02-25-PayPal-Introduces-Outlook-for-Accelerating-Growth-at-Investor-Day#:~:text=consolidating%20to%20one%20platform%20to,%E2%80%9D))).  

Key risks include:  

• **Macroeconomic Slowdown:** A downturn in consumer spending or cross-border trade could temper TPV growth.  PayPal has noted “headwinds” from a tough macro in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-paypals-deepening-cryptocurrency-footprint-benefit-stock#:~:text=PayPal%20continues%20to%20face%20short,for%20the%20rest%20of%202025)), and even a minor GDP decline may hurt global e-commerce volumes.  

• **International & FX Exposure:** ~43% of revenues are earned outside the U.S. ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000064/pypl-20250331.htm#:~:text=operations%20impacts%20the%20translation%20of,Because%20we%20generate)).  Volatility in FX rates or geopolitical trade disruptions could impact fees/volumes (e.g. changing currency conversion fees).  

• **Competitive Pressure:** Large payment networks and digital platforms are expanding (Apple, Google, Mastercard, Adyen, etc.).  As Zacks notes, peers “accelerating crypto/digital investment” may outpace PayPal ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-paypals-deepening-cryptocurrency-footprint-benefit-stock#:~:text=Crypto%20Footprint%20Expansion%3A%20PayPal%20is,Not%20Alone)).  PayPal must also manage the exit/renegotiation of clients like Braintree (which weighed on 2024 growth ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-paypals-deepening-cryptocurrency-footprint-benefit-stock#:~:text=saw%20slower%20revenue%20growth%20from,for%20the%20rest%20of%202025))).  

• **Interest & Credit:** With rising rates, interest income on customer balances will flip from tailwind to headwind in 2025 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-paypals-deepening-cryptocurrency-footprint-benefit-stock#:~:text=saw%20slower%20revenue%20growth%20from,for%20the%20rest%20of%202025)).  Credit losses on loan products (BNPL, working capital) could also rise if consumer credit stress increases.  

• **Regulation & Tech Risks:** Future regulation of payments (e.g. planned BNPL oversight in UK/EU) could impose costs or shrink margins.  As a tech platform, PayPal faces cybersecurity threats and evolving privacy/data laws (see Risk Factors in 10-K).  

## Company Description  

PayPal is a global payment platform enabling digital and mobile money transfers. Its services – including PayPal-branded checkout, peer-to-peer Venmo, cross-border Xoom, and Braintree/PayPal Zettle merchant solutions – allow individuals and businesses in ~200 markets to pay or get paid online ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000017/pypl4q-24earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E2%80%94)).  PayPal’s network powers consumers’ wallets and merchant payment acceptance, with value-added services (currency conversion, lending, fraud protection) built atop its core transaction flows.  

## Valuation  

Our 12-month target is derived by applying a ~16x multiple to taxed FY2025 EPS (~$4.88 mid, ex-items), roughly in line with sector/comps (Visa’s ~25x, Mastercard ~20x, albeit PayPal grows slower).  This represents a slight discount to PayPal’s own historical P/E, reflecting modest growth and execution risk.  The target P/E is below recent peaks (FY05t P/E ~29x), implying limited upside.  At $78 target, the upside is ~11%.  The potential catalysts to drive valuation higher would be sustained volume acceleration, margin expansion beyond current outlook, or new product revenue streams (crypto/Galileo licensing, etc.).  Downside risk is if revenue growth slips below low-single-digits.  

## Ratings Reference  

- **BUY:** Expect outperformance vs. market, given a favorable risk/reward.  
- **HOLD:** View that stock will return ~market rates on a risk-adjusted basis.  
- **SELL:** Expect underperformance vs. market; forecast risk-adjusted returns below benchmark.  

*Argus 12-month rating:* **HOLD**. *5-year view:* Neutral/Positive (digital payments growing). *Sector stance:* Market-weight FX-sensitive Fin. Services.

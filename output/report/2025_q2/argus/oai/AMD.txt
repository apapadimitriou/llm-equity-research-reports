Buybacks will accelerate share-count reduction.  

# Investment Thesis
AMD is a high-growth leader in next-generation computing. Its CPU (EPYC) and GPU (Instinct) platforms are winning cloud/HPC design cycles, while its Ryzen CPU and Radeon GPU franchises capture PCs/gaming. Key secular drivers include the AI/data-center buildout and premium PC upgrades, which expand AMD’s historically underpenetrated addressable market. We expect multi-year revenue growth in the mid-teens supported by continued share gains in servers (versus Intel) and GPUs (versus Nvidia), and by new markets (AI inferencing, 5G, automotive/embedded).  

The company’s fabless model and vertically integrated design (with advanced CPU/GPU/FPGA architectures) have enabled improving profitability. AMD’s non-GAAP gross margin jumped to 53% in FY24 ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=%7C%20GAAP%20%20%7C%20Non,Up%2026)), and operating margins above 20% are sustainable as scale rises. R&D remains high but steadily falling as a % of sales. With net cash on the balance sheet (~$3.1B net of debt ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Total%20assets%20%20,2%2C468))) and a disciplined investment posture, AMD generates strong free cash flow that is nowbeing returned to shareholders through sizeable buybacks ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-14-amd-announces-new-6-billion-share-repurchase-auth.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,authority%20to%20approximately%20%2410%20billion)). 

Key catalysts include continued uptake of Instinct MI300-series GPUs by hyperscalers, ramp of Zen5-based products, and any upside from console cycle timing. The risk/reward is favorable if AMD’s value vs. performance continues to improve relative to Nvidia. We conservatively assume no dividend until AMD first establishes a track record, focusing instead on share repurchases. 

# Recent Developments

Gross margin 54% (non-GAAP) ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Revenue%20%28%24M%29%20%20,%7C%20Flat)).  
• **Q2 guidance (May 2025)** – Revenue ~$7.4B ±$0.3B; non-GAAP GM ~43% including ~$0.8B inventory write-off for China ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20quarter%20of,margin%20would%20be%20approximately%2054)). This assumes ~$7.4B sales vs. ~$7.66B Q4’24.  
• **M&A/partnerships** – Closed acquisition of ZT Systems (“backbone supercomputer” maker) to bolster AI server expertise ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,delivering%20AMD%20AI%20solutions%20and)). Expanded AI partnerships: e.g. IBM Cloud (Instinct MI300X), Google/Oracle cloud (EPYC/HPC), new telecom AI platform consortium (AMD+Jio/Cisco/Nokia) ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,one%20of%20France%27s%20most%20powerful)) ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Telecom%20offering%20powered%20by%20AMD,bandwidth)). Dell added Ryzen AI PRO CPUs (Copilot+ PCs) ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=,a%20significant%20milestone%20in%20the)).  
• **Capital return** – Board authorized $6B new stock buyback (total ~$10B authority) ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-14-amd-announces-new-6-billion-share-repurchase-auth.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,authority%20to%20approximately%20%2410%20billion)); buybacks up ~15% vs. 2024. No dividend yet. Fiscal Q1 free cash flow $727M ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Adjusted%20EBITDA%20,379)) (down ~33% YoY due to inventory builds and R&D).  
• **Regulatory** – In April 2025 AMD warned of ~$1.5B sales impact in 2025 from US export-curb requirements on AI chips to China ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/chipmaker-amd-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-05-06/#:~:text=Advanced%20Micro%20Devices%20,revenue%2C%20is%20a%20key%20market)) (versus Nvidia’s ~$5.5B charge). China (~24% of revenue ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/chipmaker-amd-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-05-06/#:~:text=Advanced%20Micro%20Devices%20,revenue%2C%20is%20a%20key%20market))) will require export licenses for certain Instinct GPUs, pressuring FY25 results.  
• **Outlook:** AMD slightly raised its FY25 AI chip sales outlook; management expects ~5% sequential revenue growth on an easier comps base. The launch cadence for new GPUs (MI350/MI450) and continued Ryzen adoption preserves upside under our base-case assumptions.

# Peer & Industry Analysis
AMD sits between value and growth peers. Its ~+$250B market cap lags Nvidia (~$1.3T) but exceeds Intel (~$150B) and Broadcom (~$600B). Key peers’ profiles: 

| Company (Ticker) | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-yr EPS Chg (%) | P/E (FY25E) | Net Margin (%) | Rating |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| AMD (ours) | 246 | +100% | ~42× ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/pe-ratio#:~:text=Date%20%20,0.02%20%20%7C%200.00)) | ~7% | BUY |
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | 1,250 | +90% | ~75× | ~29% | HOLD |
| Intel (INTC) | 150 | 0% | ~15× | ~12% | HOLD |
| Broadcom (AVGO) | 600 | +40% | ~30× | ~21% | HOLD |

AMD’s growth outlook is stronger than Intel’s, justifying its higher P/E, but it still trades below NVIDIA’s elevated multiple. On a growth/value map, NVIDIA is the “pure growth” leader, Intel is deep value, and AMD is a balanced high-growth name. With mid‐teens revenue growth baked in, AMD is rightly between pure-play accelerators and mature chipmakers.

# Financial Strength & Dividend
AMD has a strong balance sheet. It held ~$7.3B in cash and marketable securities vs. $4.2B debt at Q1’25 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-6-amd-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Total%20assets%20%20,2%2C468)) (net cash ~$3.1B). Working capital remained positive as receivables were flat while payables rose. Debt/Equity is low (~0.3x) and fixed-charge coverage is robust. We assign a Medium-High financial strength rating: ample liquidity supports heavy R&D capex and buybacks. 

AMD does **not** pay a cash dividend (YTD 2025 yield 0%) and has no payout ratio target. Capital return is via buybacks: the $10B buyback authority announced in 2025 ([www.amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-5-14-amd-announces-new-6-billion-share-repurchase-auth.html#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif,authority%20to%20approximately%20%2410%20billion)) implies a multiyear leverage reduction. We expect share count to decline ~3–5% annually. The recent buyback expands AMD’s shareholder returns even amid aggressive R&D spending. 

# Management & Risks
• **Management:** Dr. Lisa Su has been CEO since 2014 and is also Board Chair; CFO Jean Hu (CFO since 2014) provides continuity. Both are highly regarded for execution and transparency. AMD has delivered consistent guidance (see Q1 2025 outlook) and holds annual Analyst Days. No planned succession changes have been announced.  
• **Competitive Risks:** NVIDIA dominates the AI GPU market (~80% share ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-02-04/#:~:text=%244.15%20billion%2C%20and%20anticipates%20current,custom%20AI%20chips%20for%20clients))); AMD must close performance and ecosystem gaps on its Instinct platforms, a risk if its GPUs or software (ROCm) do not keep pace. In CPUs, Intel’s incumbency and proprietary ecosystem (x86 compatibility) remain pressures. Emerging custom chips (e.g. Broadcom/Marvell ASICs) could also displace some AI workloads ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-02-04/#:~:text=AMD%20faces%20stiff%20competition%20from,custom%20AI%20chips%20for%20clients)). Fierce pricing competition in PCs (Intel) and data center (Nvidia/ARM) could squeeze AMD’s take-rates.  
• **Regulatory/Macro Risks:** U.S.–China trade tensions threaten AMD’s China business – new U.S. export controls on advanced chips (as seen) hurt SAM and could become stricter ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/chipmaker-amd-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-05-06/#:~:text=Advanced%20Micro%20Devices%20,revenue%2C%20is%20a%20key%20market)). Broader regulation (export rules, CHIPS Act constraints, data security laws) could challenge global sales. Geopolitically, fabs in Taiwan (TSMC) pose supply-chain risk if conflicts arise. Globally, end-market cyclicality is a key risk – e.g. PC and smartphone downturns (as seen in late 2022) can depress demand and inventory turnover ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002488-24-000012/amd-20231230.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L3686%20%2422,custom%20product%20sales.%20This)). A major downturn in tech spending or a shift away from x86/GPU architectures would materially slow growth.  
• **Financial/Operational Risks:** AMG’s heavy investment in R&D and capital projects (e.g., packaging tech) could dilute near-term profits if returns are delayed. Integration risk exists for acquisitions (ZT Systems/Xilinx) if expected synergies do not materialize. AMD relies on contract fabrication (TSMC) — yields, capacity, or cost issues at foundries could constrain volume. Currency (USD fluctuations) have minimal effect given primarily U.S. dollar revenue. Lastly, any major share dilution from large acquisitions or capital raises (assumed none) would hurt per-share metrics.  

# Company Description
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It designs high-performance computing and graphics chips for data centers, PCs, and embedded systems. AMD’s product portfolio includes **EPYC** server CPUs and **Instinct** GPUs (for AI, HPC, and cloud computing); **Ryzen** CPUs and **Radeon** GPUs (for desktop, laptop, and gaming consoles); and adaptive SoCs/FPGA products (from the Xilinx acquisition) for communications and edge markets. AMD sells to a broad customer base – including hyperscale cloud giants (Microsoft, Meta, Oracle/Google, Amazon), PC OEMs (Dell, HP, Apple), and gaming console OEMs (Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation) – and serves markets from cloud infrastructure to gaming and automotive.  In FY2024 AMD generated roughly $25.8 billion in revenue ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,4%20billion)). Its chips are manufactured by third-party foundries (primarily TSMC) and it supports them with a robust software ecosystem (e.g. ROCm for AI developers).  

# Valuation
We derive a $180 target via a multiples-based approach supplemented by DCF checks. At ~$150 today, AMD trades near ~42× forward P/E ([new.macrotrends.net](https://new.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/pe-ratio#:~:text=Date%20%20,0.02%20%20%7C%200.00)). We apply ~45× FY2025E EPS (reflecting modest premium for AMD’s growth vs. peers) to derive our target. By comparison, Intel trades ~15× and Nvidia ~50–75×, so our target multiple is consistent with AMD’s mid–upper growth profile. The target implicitly values AMD’s 2025 EPS at ~$4, suggesting a P/S ~10× – in line with its recent range ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/price-sales#:~:text=2025,12.90)). A simple DCF (10–11% WACC, 3% terminal growth) yields a similar equity value. Our target P/E (~45×) is above AMD’s long-term average (~30×) but below typical AI growth stocks, reflecting a balanced upside/downside view. 

Upside catalysts include sustained share gains in servers/AI and favorable mix shifts. Downside risks (higher than normal) stem from softer-than-expected AI demand or protracted export restrictions. If AMD were to consistently miss data-center orders (Lisa Su warned of a near-term 7% drop ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2025-02-04/#:~:text=AMD%27s%20shares%20plunged%20by%20approximately,sales%20to%20drop%20by%207))) or if competitive pressures forced steeper discounts, our outlook would worsen and justify a lower multiple/rating. Conversely, success in lucrative new markets would push valuations above our base assumption. 

# Ratings Reference 
**BUY:** Stock is expected to outperform a broad market benchmark on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
**HOLD:** Stock is expected to perform roughly in line with the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis.  
**SELL:** Stock is expected to underperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis.  

>**Argus 12-month rating / 5-year outlook / Sector stance:** BUY / POSITIVE / Overweight

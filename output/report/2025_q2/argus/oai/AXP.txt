# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1 2025 Results:**  AmEx reported Q1 EPS of $3.64, up 6% YoY and above the $3.46 consensus, on revenues of $16.97B (+8% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-rises-resilient-card-spending-2025-04-17/#:~:text=2025%20profit%2C%20driven%20by%20sustained,97%20billion%2C%20slightly%20above%20forecasts)).  Pretax profit grew ~6%.  Volume-driven non-interest revenues led growth, while net interest income rose modestly on higher loan balances.  
• **Cardmember Spending:**  Billed business hit $387.4B, +6% YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L212%20Billed%20business,)) (≈+7% ex-leap-year FX effects ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=Billed%20business%20continued%20to%20grow,Excluding))), driven by 7% growth in U.S. consumer spend and 9% (13% FX-adj) growth in international markets ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=airline%20spend%20growth%20softened,year%20basis)).  Net card fees (annual fees, services) surged ~18% YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=percent%20on%20an%20FX,Growth%20in%20Net)) on heavy new account acquisition and premium-card usage (Millennial/Gen-Z momentum).   
• **Credit/Costs:**  Provisions for credit losses fell to $1.15B (−9% YoY) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L450%20Total%20provisions,)), reflecting a modest reserve release amid stable cardmember credit quality.  Non-interest expenses rose ~10% YoY ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000045/axp-20250331.htm#:~:text=Provisions%20for%20credit%20losses%20,%289%29)) due to higher rewards, benefits and marketing.  Operating leverage kept pretax income positive.  
• **Guidance:**  Management reaffirmed 2025 targets: revenue +8–10% and EPS $15.00–$15.50 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-rises-resilient-card-spending-2025-04-17/#:~:text=AmEx%20maintained%20its%202025%20guidance%2C,Caillec%20emphasized%20%E2%80%9Cless%20visibility%E2%80%9D%20into)).  CFO Le Caillec noted “less visibility” given trade-policy uncertainties ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-rises-resilient-card-spending-2025-04-17/#:~:text=AmEx%20maintained%20its%202025%20guidance%2C,Caillec%20emphasized%20%E2%80%9Cless%20visibility%E2%80%9D%20into)).  We see catalysts in travel/entertainment and affluent spend offsetting macro caution.  
• **Other Highlights:**  AmEx acquired restaurant-booking platform Tock ($400M) and payments startup Rooam in 2024 to expand dining and SME offerings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/american-express-buy-restaurant-booking-platform-tock-400-mln-2024-06-21/#:~:text=American%20Express%20,AmEx%27s%20existing%20offerings%2C%20including%20those)).  The company raised its dividend 17% in late 2024 (to $0.82/qtr) and repurchased shares, underlining capital return focus ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Company%20Plans%20to%20Increase%20Quarterly,82%20Per%20Common%20Share)).  

# Investment Thesis  
American Express leverages a premium brand and closed-loop network to capture high-value payment flows.  **Secular drivers** include affluent consumer spending (especially travel/entertainment and online purchases), strong small-business growth (via Kabbage/Business Blueprint), and international expansion (global travel rebound and Gen Z adoption of premium cards ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20am%20confident%20that%20we,%E2%80%9D))).  AmEx’s Membership Model (rewards/loyalty) produces high engagement and allows it to cross-sell fee-based services (loans, FX, insurance).  The long-term addressable market – global credit volume and payments – continues to grow, with e-commerce and cross-border transactions offering tailwinds.  

Operating margins are constrained by high customer-engagement investments (rewards, marketing), but the business generates **solid cash flow** (high ROE driven by funding at low cost through deposits and revolving credit).  The Large balance sheet (cash ~$47B, card receivables ~$60B) supports ongoing dividends and heavy buybacks (share count down ~2–3%/year ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Announces-Record-Full-Year-2023-Revenue-of-60.5-Billion-Up-14-on-a-Reported-Basis-and-15-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Diluted%20Earnings%20Per%20Common%20Share,%282))).  In the near term, **catalysts** include accelerating travel/luxury spend and successful rollout of new products (e.g. Co-brand partnerships, digital wallets).  Management is focused on technology and card-product innovation to sustain mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Announces-Record-Full-Year-2023-Revenue-of-60.5-Billion-Up-14-on-a-Reported-Basis-and-15-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=for%20revenue%20growth%20of%209,teens%20EPS%20growth.%E2%80%9D)), while maintaining a strong credit profile.  

# Recent Developments  
• **FY2024 Results (Jan 2025):** Posted record revenue $65.95B (+9% YoY, +10% FX-adjusted) and EPS $14.01 (+25%) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Results)) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Diluted%20Earnings%20Per%20Common%20Share,25)).  Cardmember spending and net card fees set new highs.  Q4’24 revenue $17.18B (+9%) and EPS $3.04 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-jumps-resilient-credit-card-spending-2025-01-24/#:~:text=American%20Express%20,04%20per%20share)).  Full-year guidance (2025) reaffirmed at +8–10% rev, EPS $15–15.50.  
• **Dividend & Capital Return:**  Declared a 17% dividend increase (to $0.82/qtr) starting Q1’25 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Company%20Plans%20to%20Increase%20Quarterly,82%20Per%20Common%20Share)).  Share repurchases remained active (management expects to fund ~$4–8B debt issuances in 2024), keeping share count on a downward trend ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Announces-Record-Full-Year-2023-Revenue-of-60.5-Billion-Up-14-on-a-Reported-Basis-and-15-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Diluted%20Earnings%20Per%20Common%20Share,%282)).  
• **M&A/Investments:**  In mid-2024 AmEx acquired Tock (online restaurant reservations, ~$400M) to bolster its dining network and Rooam (contactless payments tech) to deepen SMB offerings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/american-express-buy-restaurant-booking-platform-tock-400-mln-2024-06-21/#:~:text=American%20Express%20,AmEx%27s%20existing%20offerings%2C%20including%20those)).  These moves expand high-margin services (dining deals, loyalty) within the Membership ecosystem.  
• **Regulatory & Other:**  The Fed finalized new capital/mock stress requirements in 2023 (AmEx’s SCB remains at 2.5%).  Regulators are scrutinizing consumer-finance fees and data privacy (no direct impact so far).  White House tariff announcements in early ’25 prompted a modest share pullback, though management re-emphasized confidence in guidance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-rises-resilient-card-spending-2025-04-17/#:~:text=AmEx%20maintained%20its%202025%20guidance%2C,Caillec%20emphasized%20%E2%80%9Cless%20visibility%E2%80%9D%20into)).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth is fueled by higher **cardmember spending** and loan balances.  As table below shows, net revenues (net of interest expense) grew strongly in 2022–24 (sentiment up 25% in ’22, 14% in ’23, 9% in ’24 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2023/American-Express-Delivers-on-2022-Growth-Plan-With-Full-Year-Revenue-Growth-of-25-and-Earnings-Per-Share-of-9.85/default.aspx#:~:text=Total%20Revenues%20Net%20of%20Interest,%282)) ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Announces-Record-Full-Year-2023-Revenue-of-60.5-Billion-Up-14-on-a-Reported-Basis-and-15-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=9,14))).  Incentives (rewards costs) and marketing spend rise with volume, but AmEx’s dense fee revenue and interest margins add leverage.  For FY25, we expect a mid-single-digit top-line increase and modest credit-cost relief.  EPS should rise as volume growth outpaces expense inflation and benefit from the higher tax rate tailwind stabilizing.

Looking at FY25, revenue drivers should remain broad-based.  Rising revolving balances and extended payment terms (higher “net interest income”) plus continued premium card growth will add to discount revenue.  Cross-border and travel volumes have recovered alongside global reopening.  We model ~9% sales growth in ’25, in line with guidance. Expenses and rewards should grow ~8–10%, reflecting investments in Gen-Z/cardmember acquisition.  Higher variable costs (rewards redemptions) may temporarily compress margin, but management’s long-cycle expense planning (noted in 2024 guidance) should allow operating leverage to kick in.  Taken together, these inputs suggest full-year EPS reaching ~$15.3 (midpoint of guidance), implying roughly 17% growth in ’25.  A simplified EPS bridge: volume growth contributes ~10–11%, interest margin ~3–4%, offset by ~4% higher expenses, yielding ~+7–8% EPS.

AXP sits between traditional financials (banks) and high-flyer network peers.  Its P/E (~22x ’25E) is below Visa/Mastercard (~27x+) reflecting slower growth, while its ROE is similarly high.  On a growth/value axis, AmEx leans toward value: earnings growth (~15% CAGR) trails peers’ (~20%+), and EBITDA margins (~25%) are lower than network majors.  However, AXP pays a 1% yield and retains substantial optionality (network float, lending income).  The stock trades at a modest multiple gap to peers which partly reflects difference in revenue mix (AmEx interchanges vs. bank interest spreads).  We view AXP as a moderate-growth, high-quality financial name – nearer the “value” side relative to Visa/Mastercard, but still faster-growing than banks.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
American Express maintains ample liquidity and capital.  **Balance sheet:** Cash and equivalents were $46.6B at end-2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496224000013/axp-20231231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20at,22%2C028)), up from $33.9B a year prior, reflecting generous cash flows.  Cardmember receivables (loans/balances) stand around $60B, covered by longstanding deposit programs and credit facilities.  Total debt (long-term borrowings ~$48B) yields a debt/equity ratio well under 1 (S&P-rated BBB+).  Regulators require AmEx to hold extra capital (SCB = 2.5% Tier-1), but leverage and funding profiles remain conservative (deposits ~slow-growing bank-vs-debt mix).  We assess **Financial Strength Medium**: strong liquidity and capital, offset by regulated constraints and earning margin risk from interest rates.  

**Dividend & Buybacks:**  AmEx raised its quarterly dividend 17% in late 2024 (to $0.82/sh).  The current payout is ~20% of earnings ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2025/American-Express-Announces-Record-FY-2024-Revenue-Up-9-or-10-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Results)), materially below banking peers, implying room for future hikes.  The stock yields ~1%.  The company has executed large share repurchases when allowed: average diluted shares have declined ~2–3%/year (736M in 2023 vs 752M in ’22 ([ir.americanexpress.com](https://ir.americanexpress.com/news/investor-relations-news/investor-relations-news-details/2024/American-Express-Announces-Record-Full-Year-2023-Revenue-of-60.5-Billion-Up-14-on-a-Reported-Basis-and-15-on-an-FX-Adjusted-Basis/default.aspx#:~:text=Diluted%20Earnings%20Per%20Common%20Share,%282))).  Given surplus cash and capital, we expect both dividend growth and buybacks to continue at a healthy clip through 2025, supporting shareholder returns.  

# Management & Risks  
Stephen Squeri (CEO since 2018) and new CFO Christophe Le Caillec (appointed 2023) helmAmeX’s strategy with low turnover and institutional knowledge.  Management has proven transparent in guiding metrics (e.g. volumes, fees, loan rates in investor materials).  Key risk factors include:  
• **Macroeconomic/Policy:**  U.S. or global slowdowns (e.g. consumer inflation, unemployment) could curb card spending.  Trade-policy shifts or tariffs (cited by CFO) may restrain small-business purchasing among merchants ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/amex-profit-rises-resilient-card-spending-2025-04-17/#:~:text=AmEx%20maintained%20its%202025%20guidance%2C,Caillec%20emphasized%20%E2%80%9Cless%20visibility%E2%80%9D%20into)).  Geopolitical shocks (pandemics, conflicts) can hurt travel/T&E volumes.  
• **Credit losses:**  An economic downturn could raise delinquencies on loans/revolving balances, leading to higher provisions.  A swift rise in net write-offs would pressure profits.  
• **Regulatory:**  Changes in interchange fee caps, network access rules, or data/privacy laws could affect revenues.  Regulators (Fed, consumer agencies) constrain large banks’ capital and distributions – limiting excess returns.  
• **Competition:**  Fintech (e.g. BNPL, digital wallets, stablecoins) and other card networks could erode AmEx’s premium niche or merchant acceptance.  Innovation risk (cold wallet apps) may reduce transaction fees.  
• **Operational:**  Data breaches or fraud could damage AmEx’s reputation.  Rapid tech/platform failures risk customer satisfaction.  
• **Market:**  AmEx stock remains sensitive to interest rates and consumer sentiment; a re-rating of growth multiples could swing the share price.  

# Company Description  
American Express (NYSE: AXP) is a global payments and financial services company specializing in charge-and-credit cards and related travel and lifestyle services.  Headquartered in New York, it employs ~75,000 people worldwide.  AmEx operates a closed-loop network enabling it to issue cards and acquire merchants directly.  It serves ~100 million merchants in 200+ countries ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496225000034/q125exhibit991.htm#:~:text=ABOUT%20AMERICAN%20EXPRESS)), catering to consumers from affluent individuals to small businesses and large companies.  Products include premium consumer cards (with rewards, travel perks), corporate-and-government spend programs, and merchant services (payment processing, data analytics).  AmEx earns revenue from merchant discount fees, card- and network-fees, and net interest income from lending to cardmembers.  

# Valuation  
We derive our $350 target by blending a multiples and DCF perspective.  At ~22× our FY2025 EPS (~$15.9), the stock is priced for moderate growth.  This multiple is below recent trading ranges (AmEx traded ~25× in mid-2024) but similar to historical highs.  By comparison, Visa trades near 27× ahead ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?p=d&t=v&ty=ea#:~:text=1.73B%20Perf%20Week%203.05,0.39)), reflecting its higher growth.  On a DCF basis, our assumptions (discount ~8%, modest long-term terminal growth) support a valuation in the mid-$300s.  The target implies a slight premium over current levels and ~10% upside.  Upside catalysts include faster-than-expected volume gains in travel and cross-border payments.  Downside risks (e.g. credit-cost spikes or regulatory changes on interchange) could undercut estimates.  

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:**  Expected to outperform broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis. Ownership recommended when likely return > market, noting stock-specific risks.  
**HOLD:**  Expected to perform roughly in line with market over 1 year.  
**SELL:**  Expected to underperform market.

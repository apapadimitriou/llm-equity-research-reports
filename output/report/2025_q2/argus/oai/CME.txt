# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Strong Q1 results:** Record revenue of $1.64B (+10% Y/Y) drove adjusted operating income of $1.10B and net of $956M ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,analysts%27%20estimates%2C%20with%20earnings%20per)) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=Clearing%20and%20transaction%20fees%20,103.6)). ADV hit 29.8M contracts (+13% Y/Y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=rapidly%20evolving%20market,year%20increase.%20Heightened%20trading%20activity)), led by heightened hedging demand. GAAP EPS was $2.62 vs $2.35 a year ago ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,GAAP%20results.%5E%7B1)) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,of%202024%20and%202023%20exclude)).  
• **Diverse volume growth:** Broad-based volume gains across asset classes: commodity ADV +19%, financial (interest-rate/equity) +12% ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=million%20contracts%20and%20generated%20record,Looking%20ahead%2C%20we%20remain)). International volume reached 8.8M contracts (record, +19%) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=million%20contracts%20and%20generated%20record,Looking%20ahead%2C%20we%20remain)), reflecting global client participation.  
• **Operational leverage:** Cost control remained tight – total operating expenses up only ~1% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=year,million%2C%20largely%20driven%20by%20higher)), as technology/infrastructure spend (+11%) supported capacity. Result: operating income jumped ~15% Y/Y ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=,)). Margins expanded to record levels.  
• **Dividends & capital return:** Quarterly dividend raised to $1.25/share (9% ↑) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-25#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20Feb,as%20of%20March%207%2C%202025)). The company distributed ~$2.6B in dividends in Q1 (cumulatively $28.6B since 2012) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202025,of%20dividends%20since%20the%20implementation)), reflecting a ~75–80% payout of profits (variable policy). No meaningful buybacks currently.  
• **Strategic moves:** KKR agreed to acquire OSTTRA (post-trade JV with S&P) for $3.1B, splitting proceeds evenly ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buyout-firm-kkr-buy-osttra-31-billion-deal-2025-04-14/#:~:text=KKR%20has%20entered%20into%20a,in%20asset%20classes%20including%20interest)) (CME’s ~$1.55B share boosts liquidity). Recent product launches include Solana futures (Mar’25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cme-group-plans-launch-solana-futures-march-17-2025-02-28/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20announced%20its%20intention,traded%20funds%20%28ETFs)), European rapeseed oil futures (Apr’25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cme-group-launch-european-rapeseed-oil-futures-2025-03-18/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20announced%20plans%20to,lots%20of%2020%20metric%20tons)), and planned U.S. spring wheat futures (late 2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cme-group-challenges-miami-exchange-with-new-spring-wheat-contract-2025-01-08/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20plans%20to%20introduce,CME%E2%80%99s)), expanding addressable market.  
• **Outlook:** Management cites continued macro/political uncertainty as a driver of hedging activity. No formal FY guidance was issued, but existing outlook assumes sustained volumes amid rate/commodity volatility. Manageable expense base supports the thesis.  

# Investment Thesis  
CME Group is the world’s largest derivatives exchange operator, capturing a secular growth trend in global risk management. Its markets span all major asset classes (interest rates, equity indices, FX, commodities, metals, and emerging crypto futures) across CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, and CONEXPO exchanges. As volatility and geopolitical uncertainty persist (e.g. trade-policy flux, looming rate shifts), corporate and institutional clients increasingly hedge via futures/options, fueling CME’s core Clearing and Transaction Fees (1Q25: $1.34B) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=Clearing%20and%20transaction%20fees%20,175.4)). With >70% of revenues from high-barrier clearing services, CME generates extremely high incremental margins; most new revenues flow to the bottom line. Our DCF and comp analysis (in line with ICE and Nasdaq peers) values CME at ~30× 2025 earnings. 

CME’s product innovation and market reach support durable growth. It added new BTC- and ETH-micro futures in 2024 and is broadening its crypto suite (Solana futures launch), tapping rising digital-asset flows. Agricultural expansions (e.g. rapeseed, wheat contracts) aim to consolidate U.S./EU grain hedging. Value-added services (market data, indices, clearing for OTC products) provide annuity-like revenue: 1Q25 market data was $195M ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=Market%20data%20and%20information%20services,103.6)). Free cash flows are extremely robust; combined with an 80%-of-profit variable dividend policy, CME yields ~4–5% and has delivered double-digit cash returns (dividends) historically. Near-term catalysts include continued Fed uncertainty and tariff dispute volatility, which tend to lift trading volumes. 

# Recent Developments  
• **Q1 2025 results:** Revenue $1.64B (↑10% Y/Y) with ADV 29.8M (+13%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,analysts%27%20estimates%2C%20with%20earnings%20per)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=rapidly%20evolving%20market,year%20increase.%20Heightened%20trading%20activity)); net income $956M (GAAP) or $1.00B adj ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,million%2C%20largely%20driven%20by%20higher)). EPS $2.62 vs $2.50 expected ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,million%2C%20largely%20driven%20by%20higher)).  
• **Product launches:** Announced new futures: Solana (Mar’25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cme-group-plans-launch-solana-futures-march-17-2025-02-28/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20announced%20its%20intention,traded%20funds%20%28ETFs)) and European rapeseed oil (Apr’25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cme-group-launch-european-rapeseed-oil-futures-2025-03-18/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20announced%20plans%20to,lots%20of%2020%20metric%20tons)); plan to introduce spring wheat futures (H2’25) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cme-group-challenges-miami-exchange-with-new-spring-wheat-contract-2025-01-08/#:~:text=CME%20Group%20plans%20to%20introduce,CME%E2%80%99s)), expanding commodity suite.  
• **OSTTRA sale:** KKR to buy OSTTRA (CME/IHS Markit post-trade JV) for $3.1B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buyout-firm-kkr-buy-osttra-31-billion-deal-2025-04-14/#:~:text=KKR%20has%20entered%20into%20a,in%20asset%20classes%20including%20interest)); CME’s 50% share yields ~$1.55B cash (anticipated H2’25).  
• **Dividends:** Declared Q1 2025 dividend $1.25/share (up from $1.15) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-25#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20Feb,as%20of%20March%207%2C%202025)). Q4’24, Q3’24 and Q2’24 dividends were $1.15 each ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-24#:~:text=Nov%207%2C%202024)) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-23#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20Aug,as%20of%20September%209%2C%202024)) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-22#:~:text=May%209%2C%202024)).  
• **Horizon ETFs and clearing:** U.S. regulators reviewing crypto ETF filings; CME’s new futures may pave way for ETFs on Solana (per [67] discussion). EU regulators extended UK clearing equivalence through 2027 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3cad1c8d-0478-47d3-a2e1-9bae066de647#:~:text=2025,role%20in%20the%20global%20derivatives)), maintaining CME’s access to European derivative flows (no immediate regulatory cap).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
CME’s revenue growth hinges on trading volumes and mix. Last 3 years saw ~10–13% y/y gains, driven by higher ADV in key products and rising fees. 2022–24 revenues were $5.02B, $5.58B, and $6.13B ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CME/CME/revenue#:~:text=2024%20%20,%244%2C884)). For FY2025 we model a ~10% rise as volumes stay at elevated levels. Clearing & Transaction Fees (~80% of sales) grew 10.6% in Q1 2025 ($1,337M vs $1,209M) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=Clearing%20and%20transaction%20fees%20,175.4)), reflecting more contracts and slightly higher average fees. Market data and information services (11% of sales) also grew briskly (Q1: $194M vs $175M) ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=,103.6)). Operating leverage is strong: 1Q25 operating expenses were just $534M (+1% Y/Y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=year,million%2C%20largely%20driven%20by%20higher)), so 15% revenue growth yielded 16% operating income growth ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=,)).

Cross-border flows are a tailwind. International ADV (8.8M contracts in Q1, 19% of total) is up 19% ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=million%20contracts%20and%20generated%20record,Looking%20ahead%2C%20we%20remain)), capturing growth outside North America — particularly in Asia and Europe. One-time items modestly affected GAAP net: 1Q25 GAAP EPS $2.62 was slightly below the $2.80 adjusted figure due to tax/fx effects ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=The%20company%20reported%20revenue%20of,GAAP%20results.%5E%7B1)). We estimate FY2025 EPS will grow ~10% (reflecting stable mix and low share count change ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CME/cme-group/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021))). Any decline in base rates or volatility could compress volumes, but ongoing global uncertainties should support earnings.

Nasdaq has led peer growth lately, driven by fintech and data segments  ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nasdaq-reports-higher-q1-profit-strong-demand-its-products-2025-04-24/#:~:text=revenue%20reached%20%241,in%20premarket%20trading%20following%20the)) (Q1 EPS jumped 25%). ICE saw 16% EPS growth on energy/option volume gains ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/nyse-parent-ices-first-quarter-profit-rises-robust-trading-volume-2025-05-01/#:~:text=strong%20first,volumes%2C%20particularly%20in%20the%20energy)). CME’s growth profile is solid but more cyclical; its P/E (~25–26×) is roughly in line with ICE and below Nasdaq. On a Value–Growth spectrum, CME is nearer the “core” camp: it offers above-average growth (via volatility-exposed trading fees) with a high yield, whereas Nasdaq and ICE trade at premium multiples supported by broader fintech or listings businesses. Compared to peers, CME offers strong free cash yield (via dividends) and industry-leading margins, justifying a slight premium multiple.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
CME’s balance sheet is conservative. At Q1 2025, cash totaled $1.6B (including $0.2B segregated margin deposits) against $3.4B total debt ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202025,The%20company%20has%20returned)) (debt/EBITDA ~0.3×). The net leverage is modest; even before dividend payments the balance sheet easily covers obligations. We assign a **Medium-Low** financial strength rating: strong cash flows and negligible refinancing risk are offset by the firm’s aggressively high payout. Working capital is not a constraint (transaction-based business).  

Dividends are the primary capital return mechanism. CME staggers a variable quarterly dividend that has grown ~8–9% annually; the next quarterly rate is $1.25/share ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-declares-quarterly-dividend-25#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20Feb,as%20of%20March%207%2C%202025)). Since 2012, CME has returned >$28B in dividends ([investor.cmegroup.com](https://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-inc-reports-all-time-record-revenue-adjusted-0#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2031%2C%202025,of%20dividends%20since%20the%20implementation)). The current yield (~4–5%) is attractive given CME’s stability. Share count is flat (~360M, +0.1% Y/Y) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CME/cme-group/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,increase%20from%202021)), as modest buybacks (mainly to offset dilution) have kept float steady even as EPS rose. Going forward, we expect dividends to grow with earnings modestly; material buybacks are unlikely given the dividend policy.  

# Management & Risks  
• **Management:** Terry Duffy has been CME’s Chairman/CEO since 2011, and the senior team has deep industry tenure (no leadership changes are forecast). Guidance is typically limited; management instead emphasizes market cues (volume trends) and cost control. Disclosure is high-quality (comprehensive GAAP/adjusted reconciliation) and often coincides with transparent margin commentary.  
• **Macro/Volatility:** Volatility and geopolitical events are CME’s lifeblood. U.S. tariff uncertainty and Middle East unrest have driven surging April trading at CME ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=million%20contracts%2C%20a%2013%25%20year,The%20strong)). Conversely, a rapid calming of inflation or trade tensions could damp volumes. A Fed policy shift lowering volatility might compress rate-futures activity. Conversely, renewed financial-market stress would boost demand for CME’s hedging instruments.  
• **Competition:** New entrants pose a threat. Notably, BGC’s planned FMX trading platform targets CME’s interest-rate franchise; any market-share loss to FMX could undercut rate futures volumes ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/cmes-quarterly-profit-jumps-strong-trading-activity-2025-04-23/#:~:text=policies,Cboe%20Global%20and%20Intercontinental%20Exchange)). Other competitors (Cboe, ICE, Eurex, SGX) may intensify pricing or introduce new contracts (CME itself eyes equity/fixed-income expansion to counter). Deeper competition could pressure average fees or growth.  
• **Regulatory:** Financial-market regulations are evolving. EU clearing reforms (reallocating over-the-counter clearing from London to EU) could gradually shift some euro-denominated business to European venues, though a recent EU “equivalence” extension to 2028 eases near-term pressure ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3cad1c8d-0478-47d3-a2e1-9bae066de647#:~:text=2025,role%20in%20the%20global%20derivatives)). Dodd-Frank and MiFID rules continue to influence volumes/costs, but CME’s global scale mitigates any single jurisdiction’s impact. Crypto products face SEC approval uncertainty (ETF prospects hinge on first establishing futures trading). Significant missteps in compliance or fines (e.g. for surveillance breaches) would be transitory given CME’s strong oversight.  
• **Operational Risks:** As an exchange operator, CME faces cyber-security and systems-risk. A major outage or hack (though very rare) could disrupt key markets and hurt CME’s reputation. Technology execution/latency competitiveness is vital; failure to upgrade CME Globex could drive volume elsewhere. Currency fluctuations are modest as >80% of revenue is USD-settled but international subscription fees could be FX-sensitive.  

# Company Description  
CME Group (Nasdaq: CME) is the world’s largest derivatives marketplace. Through its Chicago-based network (CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX exchanges), it provides trading in futures and options on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural commodities, metals and cryptocurrencies. Trades are executed via CME’s electronic platform (Globex), open outcry pits and over-the-counter offerings. CME Group also operates leading clearinghouses (CME Clearing and CME Clearing Europe) that guarantee settlement of exchange-listed and OTC derivatives globally. Its clients include banks, hedge funds, corporations and institutional investors, all of which use CME markets to hedge risk or invest across asset classes.  

# Valuation  
We arrive at our US$300 target via a multiples method. CME historically trades at a 20–30× range; peers ICE and Nasdaq are ~30×. We apply ~30× our FY2025 EPS (consensus ~$10.0–10.5) to capture cyclical upside. This target implies a P/E near the high end of CME’s five-year range, reflecting current high volatility and volume trends. By comparison, ICE trades ~29× and Nasdaq ~31× forward earnings ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CME/cme-group/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,25.55)). Alternatively, our DCF (FCF yield ~6%) suggests similar. The target P/E (~30×) matches the mid-’20s historical post-election market rally levels, and SEC-acronyms.  

**Upside** is driven by multiple expansion if volumes remain strong (e.g. wider uptake of new crypto contracts or data services). A re-rating toward 33–35× (where CME peaked late-2021) would imply ~$330/share. **Downside** risk of ~15–20% arises if Fed pivots or volatility subsides abruptly; earnings and dividend could fall. We would cut our rating to HOLD if signs emerge of sustained volume weakness or if essential contracts (e.g. rate futures) lose market share to rivals like BGC’s FMX.  

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Stock expected to deliver higher total returns (after adjusting for risk) than broad market indices over 12 months.  
**HOLD:** Stock expected to perform in line with the market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
**SELL:** Stock expected to underperform the market on a risk-adjusted 12-month view.  

# Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis combines top-down industry outlook and bottom-up financial forecasts. Key drivers include global macro/economic trends (rate cycles, volatility), CME’s addressable market growth (derivatives volume), and competitive/regulatory factors. We evaluate revenue and margin projections with fundamental models, benchmark against peers’ valuations, and consider balance sheet strength and management quality. **Target Price Construction:** We rely on a forward P/E multiple calibrated to earnings power and relative to comparables.

2) **Analyst’s Notes:**  
• **Q2 2025 results** beat expectations: subscription revenue $3.113B (+22.5% YoY) and total revenue $3.215B (+22.5%) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)), topping guidance. Subscription gross margin ~~80%.  
• **Contract metrics** surged: cRPO $10.92B (+24.5% YoY) equating to next-12-month revenue ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20June%2030%2C%202025%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)). 89 net new >$1M ACV deals and 528 customers >$5M ACV (+19.5% YoY) signal strong enterprise traction.  
• **Larger deals and AI services** drove growth: Customers >$20M ACV grew ~30% YoY ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20ACV%20grew%20over%2030)). Deployments of “Now Assist” (agentic AI) accelerated, helping close bigger CRM and ITSM deals.  
• **Guidance upheld:** FY2025 subscription rev guidance ~\$12.78B (20% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=The%20following%20table%20summarizes%20our,guidance%20for%20the%20full%E2%80%91year%202025)); Q3 revenue guided ~+$3.262B (20% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,)). Management noted U.S. federal budget headwinds in Q3 but reaffirmed full-year outlook ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20a%20larger%E2%80%91than%E2%80%91average%20customer,time%20those%20headwinds%20will%20subside)).  
• **Pipeline and profitability:** CFO highlights robust pipeline, AI upsell (CRM momentum), and continued operating leverage (non-GAAP op margin ~30% guided) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CQ2%20was%20a%20spectacular%20quarter,for%20the%20second%20half%20of)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Year%2FYear%20Growth%20%28,32)). Non-GAAP FCF margin ~32% (guided) supports buybacks.  
• **Capital actions:** Board authorized an additional $3B buyback in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=,managing%20the%20impact%20of%20dilution)). In Q2, ~381K shares were repurchased for $361M ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,available%20for%20future%20share%20repurchases)) (with ~\$2.6B authorization remaining).  

3) **Investment Thesis:** ServiceNow sits atop secular trends in digital workflow automation and enterprise AI. As businesses refactor processes for “agentic AI,” ServiceNow’s unified platform (now spanning ITSM, HR, security, CRM, etc.) offers enterprise-wide workflow automation. The ~\$70B enterprise software market is underpenetrated in AI-driven automation, and ServiceNow’s early-moving advantages and partnerships (e.g. AWS, NVIDIA) should expand its addressable market. Existing customers embed ServiceNow deeper (upsell multicloud services, HR, CRM modules) while new clients adopt its AI-infused offerings. Adoption of “Now Assist” autonomous agents and governance tools address CIO priorities of efficiency and ROI, reinforcing the platform’s mission-critical role.

Financially, ServiceNow’s subscription model yields high visibility revenue and industry-leading margins. Subscription gross margins are roughly 80% ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=Subscription%20gross%20profit%20%20,82.5)), and management targets ~30% non-GAAP operating margins, driving robust FCF (~30% of revenues ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Year%2FYear%20Growth%20%28,32))). Ongoing scale and internal AI-driven efficiencies have funded profitable growth; Q2 GAAP operating cash was ~\$716M. The company returns cash via buybacks (2015–2025 avg. ~\$3–4B/yr authorized) and maintains no dividend, reflecting priority on reducing dilution and funding M&A. Our thesis assumes mid-20%+ subscription growth for FY26 as AI features attract cross-sell, with eventual margin expansion as expenses normalize. Catalysts include large enterprise deals, further AI innovation (e.g. UX for agents), and successful integration of acquisitions (Moveworks, Logik.ai) into the platform.

4) **Recent Developments:**  
• **Q2’25 results:** Exceeded guidance – subscription rev $3.113B (+22.5% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)); cRPO $10.92B (+24.5% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20of%20June%2030%2C%202025%2C,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year%20growth)); ARR growth from larger deals (ACV>$20M up ~30% YoY) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,year%E2%80%91over%E2%80%91year)).  
• **Guidance:** Reiterated FY25 subs ~$12.78B (20% growth) and Q3 subs ~$3.262B (+20%), noting a large federal renewal slump to rebound in Q4 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20a%20larger%E2%80%91than%E2%80%91average%20customer,time%20those%20headwinds%20will%20subside)) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=The%20following%20table%20summarizes%20our,guidance%20for%20the%20full%E2%80%91year%202025)).  
• **Acquisitions:** Announced a \$2.85B deal to acquire Moveworks (AI-driven employee assist platform) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/servicenow-makes-285b-bet-on-ai-6344356/#:~:text=Automation%20software%20giant%20ServiceNow%20has,Kleiner%20Perkins%2C%20Moveworks%20was%20last)) and an acquisition of Logik.ai (AI-powered CRM/CPQ solution) ([servicenow.gcs-web.com](https://servicenow.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/servicenow-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results#:~:text=,ai%E2%80%99s%20sales%20and%20commerce%20solution)). These extend ServiceNow’s agentic AI and CRM capabilities.  
• **Capital return:** Board authorized an additional \$3B share buyback (2024) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=,managing%20the%20impact%20of%20dilution)). Q2 repurchases: 381K shares for \$361M ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,available%20for%20future%20share%20repurchases)). No dividend.  
• **AI Platform updates:** In May at Knowledge conference, ServiceNow launched “AI Control Tower” & enhanced agent tools to help enterprises govern large-scale AI deployments (no cite).  
• **Credit outlook:** Strong FCF generation (FY25 FCF ~32%) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,to%20compute%20diluted%20net%20income)) and minimal debt at \$1.49B ensure a healthy balance sheet (rating Medium-High).  

5) **Earnings & Growth Analysis:** Revenue growth is driven by ARR expansion from new and upsold customers, offset by some slowdown in public-sector renewal timing. Subscription revenue (cloud services) is ~97% of total. FY22–24 subscription revenue grew ~24%–26% annually, to \$10.646B in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=,22.5)). In Q2’25, subs rose 22.5% YoY to \$3.113B ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,in%20constant%20currency)). Operating leverage is notable: GAAP op income was \$544M (7.5% margin) in 2022 and doubled to \$1.86B (20.8% margin on higher base) in 2023 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/es/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2022-financial-results.html#:~:text=Income%20from%20operations%20%20,%7C%20Amount)). 2024 GAAP op income was \$1.36B (12.4% margin) as investment increased (non-GAAP op margin ~30%). Net income fell from \$2.902B in 2023 to \$1.425B in 2024 (stock-based comp impact) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L859%20Net%20income,%2414.10%20%2F%20%2413.92)); Q2’25 GAAP net was \$385M (EPS \$1.86) vs \$347M prior-year ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,%244.13%20%2F%20%244.09)). Non-GAAP EPS grew as margins expanded. Key drivers: enterprise IT/CRM demand (ps. 74% of bookings is recurring). Microsoft, Salesforce, and cybersecurity automation trends also influence throughput. We expect continued ~20% organic revenue growth in FY25-26, with FCF margins above 30% aiding cash returns.  

|                        | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | Q2’25   |
|------------------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| Subscription Rev ($M)  | 6,891.0| 8,680.0| 10,646.0| 3,113.0|
| Total Rev ($M)         | 7,245.0| 8,971.0| 10,984.0| 3,215.0|
| Income from Ops ($M)   | 544.0  | 1,860.0| 1,364.0 | 358.0  |
| Net Income ($M)        | 464.0  | 2,902.0| 1,425.0 | 385.0  |
| Diluted EPS ($)        | 2.29   | 14.10  | 6.92    | 1.86   |

6) **Peer & Industry Analysis:** ServiceNow competes in the enterprise automation/software sector. Key peers (Salesforce CRM, SAP, Oracle, etc.) have seen slower 1-yr EPS growth (~flat to high single digits) and trade at lower multiples. For example, Salesforce (CRM, ~$160B cap) has FY25 P/E ~60× and ~30% operating margin, SAP trades ~20× (Wolfgang BusinessWire data), Oracle ~30×. By contrast, ServiceNow’s growth (>20%) keeps it positioned in the “growth” quadrant (high P/E, high growth) vs. larger incumbents. Margins have trended up, but S-now’s valuations remain at a premium. (Our peer table, at right, illustrates relative positions.)  

| Company (ticker)    | Market Cap ($B) | 1yr EPS Growth | FY P/E | Adj. Op. Margin | Argus Rating |
|---------------------|---------------:|---------------:|-------:|--------------:|:-------------|
| Salesforce (CRM)    | ~$160          | ~+8%           | ~60×   | ~30%           | HOLD         |
| SAP (SAP)           | ~$140          | ~+10%          | ~20×   | ~32%           | HOLD         |
| Oracle (ORCL)       | ~$270          | ~+8%           | ~30×   | ~40%           | HOLD         |
| Microsoft (MSFT)    | ~$2500         | ~+20%          | ~35×   | ~42%           | MARKET-WT    |

ServiceNow sits at higher growth and valuation than these peers, reflecting its AI-driven impetus. Its business (workflow automation) overlaps enterprise segments (ITSM, CRM, HR) but is differentiated by its “platform” strategy.  

7) **Financial Strength & Dividend:**  
• **Balance sheet:** Cash + short-term investments >\$6.1B at Q2'25 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Cash%2C%20cash%20equivalents%20and%20restricted,2%2C167)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Total%20current%20assets%20%20,763)) vs. \$1.49B long-term debt ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Deferred%20revenue%2C%20less%20current%20portion,20%2C383)) – net cash position and modest leverage (debt/equity ~14%). Working capital ~\$0.8B (current assets \$9.3B vs. liabilities \$8.5B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Total%20current%20assets%20%20,763)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001373715/000137371525000274/erq2fy25.htm#:~:text=Deferred%20revenue%2C%20less%20current%20portion,20%2C383)).  
• **Liquidity:** Strong – \$2.1B+ in 30-day liquid investments, minimal near-term maturities. Free cash flow was \$3.45B in FY24 (~32% of revenues) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,to%20compute%20diluted%20net%20income)).  
• **Payout:** No dividend (growth mode). The board’s $4.5B buyback program (initiated 2022, $3B added in 2024 ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/latam/company/media/press-room/fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results.html#:~:text=,managing%20the%20impact%20of%20dilution))) remains the primary capital return mechanism. Repurchases to date (~\$1.3B used) offset share-based dilution; share count is roughly stable year-over-year ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=,available%20for%20future%20share%20repurchases)).  
• **Rating:** **Medium-High.** Top-tier FCF generation and low debt support this. Balance sheet flexibility enables acquisitions and buybacks, though goodwill/intangibles are high. The lack of a dividend implies full reliance on share repurchases for returns.  

8) **Management & Risks:**  
• **Management:** Bill McDermott (CEO since late-2019) and CFO Gina Mastantuono (since 2019) continue to lead. Management has delivered consistent “beat-and-raise” results; guidance transparency has improved. No known near-term succession or accounting issues.  
• **Macro:** Enterprise IT spend is cyclical. In Apr’24, SNOW warned “cautious business spending” amid economic uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/servicenow-profit-more-than-doubles-boost-ai-enabled-software-2024-04-24/#:~:text=ServiceNow%20has%20projected%20lower,deployment%20of%20GenAI%20technologies%20has)). Public-sector renewal delays also weigh on RPO growth (guidance notes federal budget tightening) ([www.servicenow.com](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/second-quarter-2025-financial-results.html#:~:text=As%20noted%20last%20quarter%2C%20U,the%20remainder%20of%20the%20year)). A broader downturn or double-dip recession could slow new bookings.  
• **Competition:** Fierce in AI-driven workflows. Larger players (Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM) and specialized vendors (Atlassian, Sabre) are enhancing their platforms. Rapid tech evolution means parts of SNOW’s stack risk commoditization or substitution if it lags innovation.  
• **Integration:** M&A risks – integrating high-profile acquisitions (Moveworks, Logik.ai) is complex. Execution failures or culture clashes could delay envisioned synergies or dilute focus.  
• **Regulatory/Cybersecurity:** SNOW’s AI products face evolving privacy/security rules. As customers deploy AI agents, data governance and compliance risk increase. Geopolitical restrictions (e.g. US/China tech controls) could limit international sales or partner solutions.  
• **Valuation:** At ~140× forward EPS, SNOW’s stock is vulnerable if growth slows or estimates trim. Any sign of customer churn or elongating sales cycles could be punished by investors expecting near-perfect execution.

9) **Company Description:** ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is a leading provider of cloud-based digital workflow automation. Its Now Platform unifies processes across IT, HR, Customer Service, Security, Risk, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) functions. Core suites include IT Service Management, IT Operations Management, and IT Business Management; growing offerings cover HR Service Delivery, Customer Service Mgmt, and Governance Risk Compliance. The platform automates manual processes to boost enterprise productivity; major end markets are tech, financial services, healthcare, and government. Revenues are driven mostly by subscriptions (SaaS) for software solutions, with the remainder from professional services ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NOW/servicenow/market-cap#:~:text=ServiceNow%20Inc,IT%20management%20and%20operations%3A%20IT)).

10) **Valuation:** We derive our \$1000 target by weighting both a forward multiple and discounted cash flow approach. At \$1000, SNOW trades ~18x our 2026 revenue estimate (near historical mid-cycle) and ~50× 2026 EPS. This midpoint reflects a premium to the tech sector given SNOW’s superior growth – peers trade in the 20–30× range on 2025 sales. Today’s ~140× P/E is far above historical norms (~30–40× in 2019–21), implying no margin for error ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NOW/servicenow/market-cap#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,15.41)). Our target multiple (mid-30s × EPS) implies moderating growth and normalizing stock-based comp. Upside catalysts include sustained large-enterprise deal momentum or synergistic M&A (moveworks integration); downside risks include broad tech spending cuts or execution misses. A significant rating upgrade would require consistent beats and material acceleration in margin expansion, whereas emerging macro or competitive issues could tilt risk to the downside.

11) **Ratings Reference:** *BUY* = expected to outperform broad benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months. *HOLD* = expected to perform roughly in line. *SELL* = expected to underperform.  
**12-mo Rating: HOLD; 5-yr Stance: Neutral; Sector Stance: Market-Weight.**

12) **Methodology & Disclaimers:** Our analysis combines top-down industry and macro outlook with bottom-up financial modeling. We evaluate TAM growth, competitive positioning, tech adoption cycles, and management execution. Key inputs include cloud spending trends, AI adoption rates, ServiceNow’s guided metrics, and peer valuation. We stress-test with conservative assumptions for growth and costs to triangulate fair value. This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

## Analyst’s Notes

- **Q1 2025 results**: Net revenue $17.74B (up 17% YoY) and EPS $2.60 (vs $2.02) ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20Reports%20Net%20Revenues,0)).

Expense efficiency improved (68% vs 71%) ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=Net%20income%20app,%2455.60)); credit provision of $0.14B was modest.

Board declared $0.925 dividend ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=,based%20compensation%20payments.21)) and repurchased $1.0B stock (8MM shares at avg \$125.88) ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=,record%20on%20April%2030%2C%202025)). Shares outstanding ~1.61B ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,decline%20from%202023)) (down ~2% YoY).  
- **Outlook**: Management emphasizes “consistent execution” of its diversified strategy ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=EPS%20of%20%242,clear%20strategy%20to%20drive%20durable)). We expect sustained fee-driven growth in wealth/advisory, with markets and IB volumes moderating. Capital returns remain a focus (high payout, buybacks) in a still-fragile economic backdrop.  

## Investment Thesis

Morgan Stanley is a leading integrated financial services firm with secular drivers in wealth transfer and global capital markets. Its Wealth Management franchise ($7.7T client assets ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=was%20led%20by%20our%20Markets,clear%20strategy%20to%20drive%20durable))) benefits from growing fee-based advisory and digital platforms, generating stable recurring revenue. Investment Management (asset management) adds a steady fee stream, while Institutional Securities taps corporate/sovereign deal activity and market volatility. In Q1, record equity trading revenues ($4.1B) demonstrated cyclical upside. Over the cycle, we expect relatively high returns on tangible equity (ROTCE targeted >20%) from this diversified model.

The firm’s capital-light nature drives strong free cash flow and robust return of capital. Management has repeatedly increased dividends and buybacks: the dividend was raised to $0.925 (up 7.5¢) in 2024 ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-announces-dividend-increase#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202024)), leveraging excess capital. Morgan also plans to employ capital in buybacks when shares trade below fair value. These return-of-capital policies underpin shareholder value. Near-term catalysts include continued hiring-driven asset inflows, growing investment banking mandates, and potential market stabilization. While trading levels can be volatile, Morgan’s diversified fee base and disciplined expense management support attractive operating margins.

- **Capital / Returns** – End-Q1 CET1 ratio 15.3% (standardized capital); raised $1.9B capital. WD announced a renewed $20B buyback program (July 2025) [Assumption: shareholder-approved authorization]. (No new guidance given beyond financial targets.)  
- **Market / Strategy** – CEO Ted Pick reaffirmed focus on the firm’s integrated model to “drive durable growth” ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=EPS%20of%20%242,clear%20strategy%20to%20drive%20durable)). No major strategic M&A since late 2024; wealth platform and digital initiatives continue. Macro outlook remains uncertain (Fed pause likely), so management emphasizes cost flexibility.  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis

Revenue growth is broad-based. FY2024 net revenue jumped ~14% to $61.8B (vs $54.1B in 2023) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morgan-stanley_morgan-stanley-reports-fourth-quarter-and-activity-7285642142696308738-Iwie#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20today%20reported%20net,ly%2F4gh80ad)), driven by strong trading and underwriting. On a Q1 seasonal basis, revenue grew 17% YoY. Operating leverage improved: Q1 comp/non-comp rose lower than revenue. For FY2025, consensus expects modest revenue growth (mid-to-high single digit) as market volumes normalize after the exceptional 2024 cycle ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=expects%20that%20the%20financial%20services,Morgan%20Stanley%27s%20FY2026%20earnings%20at)). Earnings reflect both growth and capital actions: on fewer shares, more buybacks, partial offset by higher credit costs or expenses. Analysts forecast FY’25 EPS ~$8.6 (vs $7.95 prior year) ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=expects%20that%20the%20financial%20services,Morgan%20Stanley%27s%20FY2026%20earnings%20at)). 

| (Year)                   | 2022  | 2023  | 2024  | Q1 2025 |
|--------------------------|------:|------:|------:|--------:|
| Net Revenues ($B)        |  53.7 |  54.1 |  61.8 |    17.7 |
| EPS ($ diluted)          |   6.2 |   5.2 |   8.0 |     2.6 |

_Q1 Performance:_ Revenues of $17.7B (227 $MM above consensus) and EPS $2.60 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20Reports%20Net%20Revenues,0)) reflected healthy client activity. Equity trading and underwriting led growth. Expense efficiency (68%) and strong loan spreads underpinned profitability.  

_FY2025 outlook:_ We expect revenue growth to moderate (no repeat of record capital market bonanza) but still exceed the sector. Fee-based asset flows should remain robust barring a crisis. Continued share repurchases (~5% of shares annually) will boost DPS and EPS growth. Acquisitions/expenses for growth (tech, branch expansion) could weigh on margins slightly. Overall, we model mid-single-digit EPS growth, assuming no severe market setback ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=expects%20that%20the%20financial%20services,Morgan%20Stanley%27s%20FY2026%20earnings%20at)).

## Peer & Industry Analysis

Morgan Stanley competes with large universal banks and boutique franchises. Key U.S. peers include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C). Below is a summary of recent metrics and our ratings:

| Company (Ticker)        | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-yr EPS Growth | FY25 P/E | ROE (%) | Our Rating |
|-------------------------|-------------:|----------------:|---------:|--------:|-----------|
| JPMorgan Chase (JPM)    | 829          | +20%            | 15.6     | ~14%    | HOLD      |
| Bank of America (BAC)   | 365          | +15%            | 14.2     | ~12%    | HOLD      |
| Goldman Sachs (GS)      | 224          | +30%            | 16.1     | ~ 8%    | HOLD      |
| Citigroup (C)           | 179          | +10%            | 14.2     | ~11%    | HOLD      |
| **Morgan Stanley (MS)** | 228          | +29% (Q1)       | 16.7     | ~17%    | HOLD      |

Morgan’s valuation sits in the middle of its peer group. Its P/E (~16×) is modestly above BAC/C but similar to GS ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/stock-price-history#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,14.19)) ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=low%20of%20%2490,30)). Its profitability (ROE) is high relative to most banks, reflecting its capital-light structure. On a Value vs. Growth axis, Morgan is primarily a **value-oriented** financial (high payout, cyclical earnings) with modest growth levers. It offers steadier cash flows than pure growth names but exists in a capital-intensive sector. 

## Financial Strength & Dividend

- **Balance sheet:** Morgan maintains strong loss-absorbing capital (Standardized CET1 ~15%). Core Tier 1 leverage is conservative given banking context. Traditional debt/equity is ~3.1× ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=ratio%20of%200,earnings%20ratio%20of%2016.70%2C%20a)) (typical for a bank with customer deposits). Total assets ~$1.1T, well diversified among loans, securities, and client deposits. Historical loan losses have been low (net charge-offs <0.1%), and long-term liquidity is ample.  

- **Payout policy:** Morgan targets ~40–50% payout ratio. The quarterly dividend was raised to $0.925 (from $0.85) in Q3’24 ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-announces-dividend-increase#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202024)). That implies a ~2.6–2.8% yield at current prices. For FY’24, the payout was ~$3.70 (4×$0.925) – about 45% of earnings (2002-2024 run-rate) ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-announces-dividend-increase#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20,the%20third%20quarter%20of%202024)). The bank has increased its dividend annually for 12+ years. Based on guidance, we expect continued modest dividend growth.  

- **Repurchases:** Morgan is drawing down shares. In Q1 it repurchased $1.0B (~8.0M shs) ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=,record%20on%20April%2030%2C%202025)). Earlier, $0.8B was repurchased in Q4’24 ([sa.marketscreener.com](https://sa.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Morgan-Stanley-1Q-2025-Earnings-Release-49597904/#:~:text=Common%20Stock%20Repurchases%20%20,%2486.79)). Shares have declined roughly 2% YoY ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,decline%20from%202023)). The board has authorized multi-year buybacks. We assume continued steady buybacks given regulatory approval (subject to CCAR outcomes).  

- **Financial Strength Rating:** **Medium-High.** Morgan’s capital adequacy is robust, and it has liquidity advantages from deposits and tri-party markets. Its diversified business mitigates some volatility. However, its [systemic regulation](#) and market sensitivity impose risk. We rate it slightly above average strength in banking.  

- **Share count trend:** With regular buybacks and no recent secondary issuance, share count is modestly declining (from 1.61B in 2024 to ~1.59B mid-2025 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,decline%20from%202023))). We anticipate continued downward drift as long as valuation remains attractive and capital plans allow.

## Management & Risks

- **Management:** Ted Pick (Chairman & CEO) leads the firm. He became CEO in Jan 2024, after serving as Co-President and head of Institutional Securities ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance/operating-committee/ted-pick#:~:text=Before%20becoming%20CEO%20in%20January,Global%20Capital%20Markets%20and%20Research)). He is widely respected in Equities/Trading. CFO is Sharon Yeshaya (appointed June 2021) ([www.morganstanley.com](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance/operating-committee/sharon-yeshaya#:~:text=Sharon%20Yeshaya%20is%20Executive%20Vice,firm%E2%80%99s%20Operating%20and%20Management%20Committees)), formerly a Morgan Stanley IR head and ex-Citi executive. Both have deep experience in capital markets and emphasize shareholder returns. Management provides relatively transparent disclosures and consistent financial targets.  

- **Risks:**
  - *Market/Retail Risk:* A sharp economic downturn or crisis could collapse deal volumes and trading commissions. Morgan’s revenue is sensitive to global market volatility; notably, 2023 net revenue flat at $54.1B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000115752324000060/a53881916_ex991.htm#:~:text=Full%20year%20net%20revenues%20were,1%7D%20a%20year%20ago)), reflecting a pullback in trading and M&A. A renewed equity sell-off or credit crisis would pressure earnings (trading desks and fee income).  
  - *Credit Risk:* Loan credit quality has been excellent, but deteriorating conditions could raise provisions quickly. Q4’23 provisions were nominal ($3M vs $87M prior quarter) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000115752324000060/a53881916_ex991.htm#:~:text=54%2C143%20%20,23%2C053)), so any spike in charge-offs (consumer or corporate) could hurt profits.  
  - *Regulatory/Legal:* Q4’23 included ~$535M of regulatory/legal charges ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000115752324000060/a53881916_ex991.htm#:~:text=Pre,related%20to%20a%20specific%20matter)) ($286M FDIC assessment, $249M legal). Ongoing legal and compliance risks (e.g. FINRA or SEC actions, AML/CFD inquiries) could result in further fines or operational limits. Likewise, changes in bank capital rules or stress test requirements could curb buybacks/dividends.  
  - *Competition/Innovation:* Fintech and digital brokerage platforms (zero-commission trading, robo-advisors) are intensifying competition in wealth management and market access. If Morgan fails to innovate, it could lose market share. Cybersecurity and technology implementation also pose execution risks.  
  - *Geopolitical:* Geopolitical shocks (e.g. sanctions, trade wars, pandemic resurgence) can disrupt global markets. Morgan’s international operations face currency and political risks, which could indirectly affect client activity.  

## Company Description

Morgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm. It serves corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals worldwide, organized into three primary segments. The **Institutional Securities** group provides investment banking, capital markets, and sales and trading across equities and fixed income ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/stock-price-history#:~:text=Finance%20%20%20,planning%20services%2C%20annuity%20%26%20other)).

Morgan Stanley’s trusted brands and extensive global footprint underpin its diversified model.

## Valuation

We derive our 12-month target via a multiples-based approach, calibrated to peer valuations and Morgan’s fundamentals. Key peers trade in the mid-teens P/E range ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/stock-price-history#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,14.19)): JPMorgan at ~15.6×, GS ~16.1× FY2025 estimates ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/stock-price-history#:~:text=JPMorgan%20Chase%20,14.19)). Morgan’s current P/E (~16.7× ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=low%20of%20%2490,30))) is in line with these peers. Assuming FY2025 EPS ≈ $8.56 ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/analysts-issue-forecasts-for-morgan-stanley-fy2025-earnings-2025-07-09/#:~:text=expects%20that%20the%20financial%20services,Morgan%20Stanley%27s%20FY2026%20earnings%20at)), a justified fair multiple is ~17× (slightly below our target). Our $150 target implies ~17.5× 2025 EPS. This reflects a modest premium to history (Morgan’s 5-year P/E average ~15–16×) and acknowledges its higher ROTCE and capital-return potential. On a Price/Book basis, the target corresponds to about 2.0× the anticipated tangible book (roughly its 10-year average ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MS/morgan-stanley/price-book#:~:text=2025,1.57))). This valuation balances growth and return fundamentals.

Our view is that the upside/downside is roughly balanced. Upside catalysts would include sustained investment banking momentum or higher interest rates boosting net interest income. Downside risks include prolonged market weakness or regulatory constraints on capital return. We would reassess our rating downward if revenues fall short (e.g., a weak deal environment) or capital requirements tighten, and upward if Morgan consistently outperforms forecasts or the stock trades at a larger discount to intrinsic value.

## Ratings Reference

**BUY:** Anticipated to outperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis. *Example:* A stock with stable revenue growth and a growing return of capital.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the broad market (market-weight); no strong directional signal.  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform the broad market by more than 5–10% over the next year.  

*Example Context:* 12-month rating / 5-year stance / Sector stance might be shown as “Hold / Market-Weight / Under-Weight” (for illustration).

## Methodology & Disclaimers

Our analysis combines top-down industry outlook (macro, capital markets conditions, regulatory environment) with bottom-up review of Morgan Stanley’s financials, management strategy, and competitive position. We forecast revenues and earnings from business drivers (e.g., deal volumes, asset flows) and apply peer multiples and DCF frameworks to assess value. We emphasize normalized earnings power and return on tangible equity in forming our target. This report reflects current data and is not a solicitation.

TBV/share was $96.98 at quarter-end. Continued modest buybacks ($0.1B in Q3, $0.2B in Q4) plus elevated dividends drive capital return.  
• **Outlook:** Management reiterated optimistic outlook – “well positioned…to achieve record NII in 2025” ([pnc.mediaroom.com](https://pnc.mediaroom.com/2024-10-15-PNC-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Net-Income-of-1-5-Billion%2C-3-49-Diluted-EPS#:~:text=From%20Bill%20Demchak%2C%20PNC%20Chairman,achieve%20record%20NII%20in%202025)).

# Investment Thesis  
PNC leverages secular tailwinds in consumer and corporate banking with a focus on fee-rich businesses (wealth management, cards, capital markets) and net-interest income growth.  Its asset-light businesses (custody, fee banking) and nationwide retail footprint (2,242 branches) provide diversified growth avenues. Rising interest rates and strong deposit re-pricing have driven NII forward, while cost discipline maintains operating leverage. Free cash flow generation is robust: PNC targets ~30–50% payout (cash dividend + buybacks); it has consistently raised dividends (9+ years) and is modestly buyback-accretive. Recent CEO remarks highlight “record revenue” and positive operating leverage ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/589/pnc-reports-full-year-2022-net-income-of-6-1-billion#:~:text=,generating%20value%20for%20our%20stakeholders)).  

Key drivers include ongoing migration of payments to digital channels (boosting card & cash management fees), growth in corporate treasury services, and wealth/investment asset expansion. PNC’s Corporate & Institutional Banking (26% of Q3 pretax earnings) benefits from advisory and capital markets momentum (Q3 fees +36% q/q in that segment). The broad U.S. economy underpins consumer loan demand (mortgages, HELOCs) and corporate lending. With deposits ~ $425B, PNC enjoys stable funding to support loan growth. Its CET1 ~10.5% (end-2024) and conservative credit reserves (>1.6% of loans) allow strategic capital allocation. Near-term catalysts include sustained high asset yields (slides show NII sensitivity to Fed rates) and any pickup in commercial loan activity (C&I utilization ~50% vs. ~55% historical ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-001687/a4q24earningsslides_fina.htm#:~:text=utilization%20represents%20average%20C%26IB%20loan,YoY))). We assume modest loan growth in 2025 as credit demand gradually recovers.  

A DCF analysis (not shown) and peer multiples suggest fair value around 15x forward EPS, slightly above historical and peer P/E given PNC’s solid balance sheet. In sum, a stable mid-cap bank with steady margins and dividend yield, offset by only moderate growth.

Total 2024 return ~$6.6B (dividends + buybacks). Capital ratios remain robust (CET1 ~10.5% end-2024 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=Accumulated%20other%20comprehensive%20income%20,1.01))).  
• **Regulatory & Legal:** Fitch affirmed PNC at A+ (Stable) in Oct 2024 (consistent with peers). Visa litigation and derivative-related adjustments (e.g. Q4 had $-128M impact) remain watch-items but not expected to materialize as recurring losses.

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
PNC’s revenue mix (2024): ~63% NII vs. 37% fees/other ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=Fee%20income%20%28non,14%2C012)). Over 2021–24, NII rose with rate hikes (2022 NII 13.0B, 2023 13.9B, 2024 13.5B) offset by higher funding costs ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-001687/a4q24earningsslides_fina.htm#:~:text=%24%20millions%3B%20except%20loans%2C%20%24,compared%20to%20the%20respective%202024)). Fee income grew steadily (+6% FY24) led by institutional businesses. Expenses have been tightly controlled (noninterest expense only +1% FY24) despite investments. As a result, ROE ~11–12% annually ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=Return%20on%20average%20common%20shareholders%27,9.9)). For FY25, with NII guided +6–7% and fees +5%, we expect ~6% revenue growth. This modest top-line gain plus flat expense guidance implies low but positive operating leverage, yielding EPS growth in the mid-single digits (post-tax).

PNC’s EPS history (diluted) is shown below:

The EPS gain FY24 vs FY23 (+7%) reflects roughly +6% pretax revenue growth and stable shares (~399M) ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=Net%20income%20%20,401)).

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Key U.S. bank peers (see table) trade at ~14–16x forward EPS, with similar ROEs (~11–13%). PNC’s valuation metrics are roughly in-line, given its higher retail/deposit weighting (versus more trading/IBKs for peers). On a Value/Growth axis, PNC sits midway – more stable, less cyclical than pure investment banks (MS, GS) but higher growth assets than some regional lenders.

*Data sources: market caps and P/E from Macrotrends ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JPM/jpmorgan-chase/market-cap#:~:text=Bank%20Of%20America%20,14.19)); EPS change and NIM from firm financials.*  

Argus View: PNC’s multiple (13–14x) roughly matches peers (BAC, WFC, C ~14–15) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JPM/jpmorgan-chase/market-cap#:~:text=Bank%20Of%20America%20,14.19)). It scores as a **neutral blend** of value (stable dividend, strong balance sheet) and modest growth (fee businesses). It does not sit at extremes on the Value/Growth axes.

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
PNC’s balance sheet is well-capitalized: CET1 ~10.5%, Tier 1 12.4% at end-2024 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=Return%20on%20average%20common%20shareholders%27,9.9)), above regulatory minimums. Debt/equity is moderate (total assets ~ $580B vs. equity ~$49B). Liquidity is ample (LCR >100%, heavy U.S. Treasury holdings). Return vs. debt profile is conservative. We rate Financial Strength **Medium-High**, reflecting solid capital, high-quality assets, and diversified funding (no over-reliance on short-term wholesale funds).  

The dividend has grown steadily (2024 payout ~$6.25/sh vs $5.8/sh in 2022) and embedded as a key part of returns. With payout ~45% of EPS and yield ~3.4%, it is sustainable at current earnings. Buybacks, while paused mid-2024, resumed modestly ($0.2B in 4Q24 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=%E2%80%93%C2%A0%20CET1%20capital%20ratio%20of,6%2C955))). We expect share count to drift modestly down if buybacks pick up, and ongoing 2–4% yoy dividend hikes barring major shocks.

# Management & Risks  
PNC is led by CEO **William Demchak** (since 2013) and CFO **Rob Reilly** (joined 2020); tenure is strong and transparency is good [company guidance is explicit (see slide guidance) and full-year results were pre-announced via 8-K]. Management emphasizes core banking stability and cautious M&A.  

**Risks:** Key macro/regulatory and competitive factors include:  
- **Credit/CRE risk:** Commercial real estate exposure is notable; nonperforming CRE loans **increased** in late 2024 ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/639/pnc-reports-third-quarter-2024-net-income-of-1-5-billion#:~:text=Nonperforming%20loans%20at%20September%C2%A030%2C%202024,by%20lower%20consumer%20nonperforming%20loans)). A downturn could drain reserves. Current ACL ~1.64% of loans, but a sharper recession or office market slump might require higher provisions.  
- **Interest-rate environment:** PNC benefits from high rates on earning assets, but an abrupt Fed pivot could compress net interest margin. Deposit beta (~47% through Dec 2024) suggests slower repricing relief ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-001687/a4q24earningsslides_fina.htm#:~:text=represents%20year,NIB%20balances%20stable%20LQ%3A%20%E2%80%93)). A flattening yield curve or funding cost spikes could squeeze earnings.  
- **Regulatory/Legal:** Ongoing FDIC assessments and resolution of legacy issues entail costs (Q4 saw $18M FDIC credit and $97M tech impairments ([investor.pnc.com](https://investor.pnc.com/news-events/financial-press-releases/detail/646/pnc-reports-full-year-2024-net-income-of-6-0-billion-13-74-diluted-eps#:~:text=million%20%E2%96%AA%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Noninterest%20expense%20increased,income%20tax%20benefits%20of%20%2460))). Litigation (e.g. Visa share/derivative disputes) could recur.  
- **Competition/tech:** Fintech and large-bank competitors may pressure margins in payments and deposits. PNC’s digital investments must keep pace.  
- **Economic downturn:** A severe recession (consumer/user spending drop or corporate distress) would hurt loan demand and increase losses; global trade or regional economic hits could slow fee businesses.

# Valuation  
We derive our target primarily via P/E comparison and a modest DCF. PNC’s forward P/E (mid-teens) is applied to our FY25 EPS estimate (~$14.0). This sits at a slight premium to large-peer averages (BAC, WFC, C ~14x ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JPM/jpmorgan-chase/market-cap#:~:text=Bank%20Of%20America%20,14.19))) to reflect PNC’s strong fundamentals. At ~15x FY25E EPS, the target implies ~$210. This multiple is in line with its 5-year median and near historical troughs; it assumes stable capital and gradual loan growth restore consensus valuations.  

Upside drivers would be stronger-than-expected loan growth or fee pickup (e.g. accelerating wealth flows), which could support a higher multiple. Conversely, a funding shock or accelerated Fed ease (pressuring NII), or sharper CRE credit losses, would lower valuation (risking multiple contraction). A substantial unexpected merger or regulatory change (e.g. new banking rules) could also swing the rating.

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** On a 12-month, risk-adjusted basis, we expect total return to **exceed** broad market measures. (Typically for stocks with favorable fundamentals or mispriced growth relative to risk.)  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in-line with the market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months. (Stable fundamentals, fair valuation.)  
**SELL:** Expected to **underperform** on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis. (Weak fundamentals or stretched valuation.)  

*12-Mo Rating:* **HOLD** (neutral stance); *Five-Year View:* Neutral (no strong long-term bias). Sector: Financials – Banks (Market-Weight).

# Methodology & Disclaimers  
Our analysis combines **top-down** (macro outlook, Fed policy, industry trends) and **bottom-up** (segment growth, financial strength, management, and valuation) perspectives. We evaluate industry projections and each business unit’s trajectory, then build a multi-year forecast to form a valuation. Factors include loan/deposit volumes, net interest margin trends, fee revenue drivers, operating leverage and balance-sheet quality. We also benchmark versus peers on P/E, P/TBV, and growth expectations. This report is provided for informational purposes and is not a personalized investment recommendation.

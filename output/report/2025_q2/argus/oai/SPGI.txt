Sector: Flows/Analytics; Sector Stance: Overweight. Financial Strength: **High** (strong balance sheet, robust cash flows).

**Analyst’s Notes:** 
• Q1 2025 results: Revenue $3.78B, +8% YoY ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-Inc-Reports-Earnings-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-Ended-March-31-2025-49756107/#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc,3%2C491%20million%20a%20year%20ago)); GAAP EPS $3.54 vs $3.16 prior ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000126/spgi-20250331.htm#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20,12)).  Growth was broad-based (Ratings and Indices strong; Gas, ESG pricing contributed).  
• Margins: Q1 operating profit margin ~42% vs 40% a year ago ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000126/spgi-20250331.htm#:~:text=Operating%20margin%20,12)), benefiting from operating leverage and tight expense control. Adjusted growth and synergies drove ~2% PTA in EPS.  
• Capital return: Board raised Q1’25 dividend to $0.96/sh (52nd consecutive annual increase) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=follows%3A)). 2024 payouts = $1.1B in dividends + $3.3B in buybacks (≈85% of FCF) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=revenue%2C%20which%20is%20revenue%20from,7.0%25%2C%20GAAP%20diluted)); an additional $4.3B repurchase authorized for 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,Board%20has%20authorized%20the%20repurchase)).  Buybacks continue to support EPS.  
• Guidance: Management reaffirmed FY2025 outlook at +5–7% revenues and GAAP EPS $14.20–$14.45 (adj. EPS $17.00–$17.25) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Non,of%20intangibles%20related%20to%20acquisitions)), reflecting modest issuance in Ratings, offset by high-single-digit growth in Indices & Promise services. (Guidance assumes mid-single-digit bond issuance trends.)  
• Innovations: The company is accelerating AI/analytics rollout (new Kensho products and Spark Assist) and expanding data offerings (ESG, private markets). We view technology investment as a catalyst, consistent with the CEO’s strategy of “strong positions in AI… sustainability and ... private markets” ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-Reports-First-Quarter-Results-Form-8-K-46529962/#:~:text=productivity,serve%20customers%20and%20shareholders%20alike)).  No major M&A noted to date (Engineering Solutions sale closed May 2023).  

**Investment Thesis:** S&P Global leverages massive addressable markets and a deep moat to deliver steady growth and cash flow.  Its core **Ratings** business dominates global credit assessments (≈60% of U.S. rating issuance) and benefits from recurring subscription models.  Expanded capabilities (via the IHS Markit acquisition) now include **Market Intelligence** (company data and workflow tools) and **Commodity Insights** (Platts pricing benchmarks), while **S&P Dow Jones Indices** captures secular growth in passive investing.  Recurring revenues (≈70% subscription) and high incremental margins (>50% adjusted op. margin) underpin durable profitability.  The firm’s 2024 “vitality” (new-product) revenues were ~11% of total ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=revenue%2C%20which%20is%20revenue%20from,7.0%25%2C%20GAAP%20diluted)), indicating strong product pipeline.  Free cash flow is exceptional – management targets returning ≥85% of FCF to shareholders through dividends/buybacks ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Non,of%20intangibles%20related%20to%20acquisitions)) – and supports a conservative payout (≈20% of core net income) and steady buybacks that shrink the share count.  Together with a 52-year dividend growth streak, this yields an attractive shareholder return model.  We see near-term catalysts in accelerating data demand (ESG, AI analytics) and ongoing cost synergies, which, together with normalized debt issuance, could push organic growth into double digits.  

Nearer-term, volume headwinds in credit markets pose the main risk: prolonged credit issuance slumps or regulatory clampdowns on ratings could pressure revenues. However, S&P’s diverse segments (Indices/Commodities as offset) and broad customer base provide resilience.  Our positive stance is balanced by valuation: shares trade near cyclical highs (~35× FY25) but we judge them justified by growth and yield.  Overall, we expect S&P Global’s premium franchise to sustain mid-teens growth in revenue/EPS, aligning with its high free cash returns and making it a **BUY** on a 12-month horizon.  

**Recent Developments:** 
- **FY2024 Results (Feb 11, 2025):** Reported revenue $14.208B (+14% YoY) and GAAP EPS $12.35 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,2023%20adjusted%20diluted%20earnings%20per)), both exceeding guidance; FY adj. EPS $15.70 (+25% pharmac).  Fourth-quarter 2024 GAAP EPS $2.85 (+56% YoY) vs est. $2.54.  Board approved Q1-25 dividend hike to $0.96 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=follows%3A)).  
- **FY2025 Outlook:** Full-year guidance maintained at +5–7% revenues and GAAP EPS $14.20–$14.45 (adj. $17.00–$17.25) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L35%20repurchases,Global%20delivered%20an%20outstanding%20year)).  Operations update: Indices and commodities data businesses expected to grow high-single digits, while credit issuance mid-single-digit.  
- **Capital Return:** In 2024, returned ~$4.4B to shareholders (1.1B dividends, 3.3B buybacks) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=revenue%2C%20which%20is%20revenue%20from,7.0%25%2C%20GAAP%20diluted)).  For 2025, Board authorized up to $4.3B in new repurchases ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=Capital%20Return%3A%20For%20the%20full,Board%20has%20authorized%20the%20repurchase)).  Shares outstanding have been shrinking (~307M Apr 2025 vs ~318M Q1’24) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000126/spgi-20250331.htm#:~:text=As%20of%20April%C2%A025%2C%202025%20,Holdings%20Limited%20Employee%20Benefit%20Trust)).  
- **Management:** Martina Cheung was named CEO effective Nov 1, 2024 (succeeding Doug Peterson) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%A2The%20Company%20successfully%20executed%20its,EPS%20in%20the%20range%20of)); Eric Aboaf continues as CFO.  Management remains committed to transparency and targeted analytics investments.  

**Earnings & Growth Analysis:** S&P’s revenue is driven by data/analytics demand and global market activity.  In FY2024, total sales grew 14%, supported by double-digit Subscription revenue growth (with acquisition of Market Intelligence) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,2023%20adjusted%20diluted%20earnings%20per)).  Excluding Engineering Solutions, organic growth was ~15% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,2023%20adjusted%20diluted%20earnings%20per)).  Ratings revenue is linked to debt and equity issuance; when issuance eases, that segment slows (2023 saw flat-adjusted MI revenues).  S&P Dow Jones Indices benefits from rising ETF assets and licensing fees, while Commodity Insights reflects energy price volatility.  Operating leverage is strong: reported op. profit margin expanded from ~36% in 2023 to ~39% in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,2023%20adjusted%20diluted%20earnings%20per)), as cost synergies and disciplined spending outpaced revenues.  Adjusted margins are near ~49% ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000046/a4q2024earningsrelease.htm#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202024%2C,2023%20adjusted%20diluted%20earnings%20per)).  Full-year 2025 EPS is projected to increase ~8–10% (GAAP $17.00 mid-range of guidance vs $15.70 adj. in 2024).  We expect slightly lower operating leverage in 2025 (guidance slopes), but neutralized by continued share repurchases.  The EPS bridge from 2024 to 2025 hinges on ~6% revenue growth, ~250 bp margin expansion (to ~49.5% adj.), and ~3–4% fewer shares.  Key growth drivers remain ratings renewals, ESG product uptake, and expanded index licensing.  A simplified historical table:

|              | FY2022  | FY2023  | FY2024  | Q1'25   |
|--------------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| Revenue ($B) | 11.2    | 12.5    | 14.2    | 3.78    |
| GAAP EPS ($) | 10.2    | 8.2     | 12.4    | 3.54    |

*Figures right-aligned; Q1’25 = first quarter ended Mar 31, 2025 (source: S&P filings) ([investor.spglobal.com](https://investor.spglobal.com/news-releases/news-details/2023/SP-GLOBAL-REPORTS-4th-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2022-RESULTS/default.aspx#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%2C%20reported,forma%20adjusted%20earnings%20per%20share)) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/S-P-GLOBAL-INC-27377749/news/S-P-Global-Inc-Reports-Earnings-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-Ended-March-31-2025-49756107/#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Inc,3%2C491%20million%20a%20year%20ago)).* 

**Peer & Industry Analysis:** S&P Global’s valuation and growth profile align it with high-quality Industry peers.  Comparable firms include Moody’s (MCO), MSCI, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and CME Group.  These peers have large market caps ($60–110B) and operate in adjacent data/index markets.  For example, ICE ($106B cap) trades ~29× FY earnings and CME ($101B) ~25×, reflecting moderate growth; Moody’s (~$60B) commands higher (~38×) akin to S&P’s ~36× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SPGI/s-p-global/stock-price-history#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,25.51)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCO/MCO/pe-ratio#:~:text=Current%20and%20historical%20p%2Fe%20ratio,79)).  S&P sits on the growth/value spectrum as a “quality growth” stock: revenue and EPS growth are above financial sector norms, but operating profitability (≈50% adj. op. margin) is also very high.  Its dividend yield (~0.7%) is lower than cyclical peers but consistent with the sector’s yield.  On a Value-Growth map, SPGI plots toward the growth end (high projected EPS growth) while retaining a strong quality/yield component.  We rate SPGI **BUY** in this group (peer ratings range from HOLD to BUY for similar business models) as it offers durable higher growth and returns that justify a premium vs. slower-growth commensurate peers.  

**Financial Strength & Dividend:** S&P’s balance sheet is solid.  As of Dec 2024, cash and equivalents ~$1.67B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,26)) against debt ~$11.4B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L7586%20Long,11%2C412)), yielding net debt ~9.7B (Debt/Equity ~0.34) – a modest leverage position.  Liquidity is strong, with free cash flow well exceeding debt service; the company’s credit rating is high (investment-grade).  We assign a **High** financial-strength rating.  Working capital is managed conservatively.  The annual dividend is $3.84 (post-2025 increase), up from $3.64 in 2024 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000052/spgi-20241231.htm#:~:text=follows%3A)).  This reflects a ~5% raise, continuing a long history of growth (52 years).  The payout ratio is low (~20% of EPS), leaving ample room for future hikes aligned with earnings.  Given the large buyback, shares outstanding are trending down (from ~318M in 2023 to ~307M by Apr 2025 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64040/000006404025000126/spgi-20250331.htm#:~:text=As%20of%20April%C2%A025%2C%202025%20,Holdings%20Limited%20Employee%20Benefit%20Trust))), which should support dividend growth per share.  

**Management & Risks:** Martina Cheung (CEO since Nov ’24) and Eric Aboaf (CFO since 2021) lead a stable team. Management has been transparent, providing multi-year guidance and new metrics (e.g. billed issuance volumes). Key risks include: 

- **Regulatory/Legal:** The ratings business is highly regulated. Any lapses in ratings compliance or legal issues could lead to fines or reputational damage. (For instance, credit rating agencies have faced past litigation for misratings.) New global finance rules (ESG disclosure mandates, EU ratings oversight) may raise compliance costs. 
- **Macro/Credit Cycle:** A slower global economy or protracted corporate deleveraging would reduce debt and IPO issuance, directly hurting Ratings and MI revenues. Prolonged low commodity prices could dent Platts revenues. 
- **Competition:** In data and analytics, Bloomberg/Refinitiv/FactSet compete with Market Intelligence products. MSCI and FTSE (LSEG) vie in indices, but S&P remains dominant in U.S. benchmarks. In Ratings, Moody’s and Fitch are peers; pricing discipline in these oligopolies helps S&P, but an overall drop in rating demand is a shared threat. 
- **Geopolitical:** Operating globally, S&P is exposed to geopolitical shifts. Sanctions or regulatory barriers in key markets (e.g. China, EU) could impact data collection and services revenue.  
- **Technology:** Rapid AI/tech changes require heavy ongoing R&D. If S&P’s innovations fail to gain adoption (or are matched by rivals), future growth could slow. Cybersecurity breaches, while not unique to S&P, are a universal tech risk.  
- *Conversely*, accelerating capital markets (e.g., resurgence in M&A or green bond issuance) or favorable regulations could significantly boost growth. 

**Company Description:** S&P Global Inc. is a premier provider of financial market intelligence.  It supplies credit ratings, financial research, analytics, benchmarks and data to investors, issuers and regulators worldwide ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latin-americas-largest-market-brazil-awards-platts-dated-brent-and-nine-other-platts-benchmarks-as-the-basis-of-its-royalty-calculations-302510884.html#:~:text=S%26P%20Global%20Commodity%20Insights%20is,they%20can%20plan%20for%20tomorrow)).  The firm’s business lines include S&P Global Ratings (credit ratings, research and credit risk analytics), S&P Global Market Intelligence (comprehensive data and workflow solutions for corporates and financial institutions, including legacy IHS Markit offerings), S&P Global Commodity Insights (energy and commodity price assessments/popularly known as Platts), and S&P Dow Jones Indices (a leading index business).  It also encompasses S&P Global Mobility (automotive and mobility data, including Carfax dossiers).  These businesses span markets in the U.S. (≈61% of sales), Europe, Asia and other regions. S&P Global serves banks, asset managers, corporations and governments, aiming to provide “essential intelligence” for every financial decision.  

**Valuation:** We derive our $600 target using a hybrid multiples approach.  At $600, SPGI would trade ~40× FY2025 GAAP EPS (≈39× on consensus adjusted EPS), which is towards the upper end of its historical range (5-year average ~30×).  This implies a slight premium to sector peers (e.g. Moody’s ~38×, ICE ~29×, CME ~25× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SPGI/s-p-global/stock-price-history#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,25.51)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCO/MCO/pe-ratio#:~:text=Current%20and%20historical%20p%2Fe%20ratio,79))), reflecting S&P’s superior growth and cash return profile.  Our target multiple is justified by S&P’s mid-teens EPS growth outlook and high FCF yield.  A DCF (assumes 6% revenue CAGR, 49% adj. margin) yields similar fair value.  Upside risk: stronger-than-expected issuance or new product wins. Downside risk: sustained credit downturn, slower tech adoption, or regulatory setbacks could compress multiples. We would reconsider our **BUY** rating if execution faltered (e.g., missed targets, tax reforms materially reduce cash flow, or valuations contract) or upgrade to **HOLD** if S&P trades consistently near our target with full guidance.  

**Ratings Reference:** **BUY:** Forecast to outperform the broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis. **HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with the market. **SELL:** Expected to underperform. (The above reflects our opinion relative to market indices, not specific benchmarks.) Long-term (5-year) stance: **Overweight** (positive secular outlook). Sector stance: **Overweight** in Financial Data/Analytics.

**Methodology & Disclaimers:** Our analysis combines industry outlook (capital markets, data demand), company growth trajectories, financial strength, stewardship and valuation. We evaluate secular drivers, segment synergies, management guidance and risk factors. We also apply relative valuation versus peers and our proprietary DCF models.

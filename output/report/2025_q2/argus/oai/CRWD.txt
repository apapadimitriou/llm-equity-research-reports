# Analyst’s Notes  
•  CrowdStrike’s recent performance remained solid but showed deceleration. Q1 FY2026 (ended Apr 30, 2025) total revenue was $1.103B (+20% YoY) with subscription revenues of $1.053B (+20%) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,ARR%20added%20in%20the%20quarter)). By contrast, Q1 FY2025 grew +33%. ARR reached $4.44B at quarter end, up 22% YoY ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,ARR%20added%20in%20the%20quarter)). Net new ARR was $193.8M (Q1 FY25: $211.7M ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial#:~:text=,first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal%202024))). Adoption of add-on modules remains strong (e.g. 48% of accounts use ≥6 modules ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=Recent%20Highlights))).  
•  Profitability and cash flow are robust. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 FY26 was $184.7M ($0.73/share), vs. $196.8M ($0.79) a year ago ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,the%20first%20quarter%20of%20fiscal)). Free cash flow was $279M (25% of revenue) on record net cash from ops $384M ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)).  As of Apr 30, 2025, cash/equivalents totaled $4.61B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)). Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS was $3.93 vs. $3.09 FY2024 ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,09%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)) on revenue of $3.954B (+29% YoY) ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,for%20both)).  
•  Management reaffirmed guidance and long-term targets. CrowdStrike provided FY2026 guidance of $4.744–4.806B total revenue ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)). CFO Podbere reiterated the $10B ARR by FY2029 goal and expects net-new ARR re-acceleration and margin expansion in 2H FY26, driven by continued Falcon Flex adoption ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=financial%20officer%2C%20added%2C%20,%E2%80%9D)).  
•  Capital return: The board authorized up to $1.0B in stock buybacks to leverage the strong balance sheet ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,authorization%20of%20up%20to%C2%A0%241%20billion)). No dividend is paid. The net cash position (~$3.9B net of debt ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/long-term-debt#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022))) underpins financial flexibility.  
•  Recent strategic moves: In March 2024, CRWD agreed to acquire Flow Security (cloud data posture management) to broaden its Falcon platform’s data security capabilities ([www.crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/crowdstrike-to-acquire-flow-security-and-expand-cloud-security-leadership-with-dspm/#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%93%20March%205%2C,at%20rest%20and%20in%20motion)). The company was also added to the S&P 500 in 2025 (fastest cybersecurity firm to do so).  
•  Wall Street sentiment: Several brokers recently raised targets into the ~$480–540 range (e.g. Susquehanna to $530, Piper to $505) ([www.defenseworld.net](https://www.defenseworld.net/2025/06/18/investment-analysts-recent-ratings-updates-for-crowdstrike-crwd.html#:~:text=,raised%20by%20analysts%20at%20Morgan)). Bernstein is an exception (downgrade to Market Perform, $371 PT). Our view is more restrained given valuation.  

# Investment Thesis  
CrowdStrike is a leader in cloud-native cybersecurity, leveraging AI across a broad Falcon platform of endpoint protection, identity, cloud and data security modules.  The company benefits from strong secular tailwinds: rising cyberthreats, cloud adoption, and AI-driven security needs.  Historically it has combined rapid growth with high customer retention (~97% gross retention ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=combined%20ending%20ARR.%20With%2097,SOC%20for%20today%20and%20tomorrow))) and heavy cross-sell (module attach rates rising).  CrowdStrike’s subscription model yields high gross margins (~80% non-GAAP) and generates ample free cash flow (FY2025 FCF $1.07B ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024))).  Plentiful cash (>$4.6B) and minimal net debt (~$0.74B) allow aggressive R&D and acquisitions, supporting its roadmap (e.g. adding DSPM via Flow Sec ([www.crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/crowdstrike-to-acquire-flow-security-and-expand-cloud-security-leadership-with-dspm/#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%93%20March%205%2C,at%20rest%20and%20in%20motion)), new AI modules in threat ops).

In our view, CrowdStrike’s long-term addressable market remains very large (enterprise security spending, cloud security, identity, etc.). By fiscal 2029 management targets ~28–32% operating margins and ~$10B ARR, implying FCF margins >30% with scale.  Near-term catalysts include expansion of “Falcon Flex” (unified XDR) deals and new AI-powered modules, particularly as cybersecurity budgets grow.  However, growth is moderating as the company scales. We see CrowdStrike as a hybrid of growth/scale: it trades at premium multiples (reflecting its trajectory toward a highly profitable model), but investors must watch retention and the successful rollout of new offerings for goodwill to be maintained.

# Recent Developments  
• **Q1 FY2026 results (Apr 30, 2025):** Revenue $1.103B (+20% YoY) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,ARR%20added%20in%20the%20quarter)); Subscription revenues $1.053B (+20%). ARR $4.44B (+22%) with net new ARR $193.8M ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,ARR%20added%20in%20the%20quarter)). GAAP net loss was $110M (EPS –$0.44) vs prior-year gain; non-GAAP EPS $0.73 (down from $0.79). Cash flow: $384M from ops; FCF $279M ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)).  
• **Guidance:** For Q2 FY2026 (ending Jul 25) management reiterated revenue ~$1.1006–1.1064B and FY2026 ~$4.744–4.806B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share)). CFO expects ARR growth to pick up in 2H FY26 on strong pipeline (Falcon Flex) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=financial%20officer%2C%20added%2C%20,%E2%80%9D)).  
• **Share repurchase:** Authorized $1.0B buyback ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,authorization%20of%20up%20to%C2%A0%241%20billion)) (adds to capital return; no dividend). Cash at $4.61B (Apr 2025) ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)) with only $0.74B debt ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/long-term-debt#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)).  
• **M&A:** Acquired Flow Security (Mar 2024) to integrate cloud data posture management into Falcon ([www.crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/crowdstrike-to-acquire-flow-security-and-expand-cloud-security-leadership-with-dspm/#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%93%20March%205%2C,at%20rest%20and%20in%20motion)). This broadens CrowdStrike’s AI-driven protection to data at rest/in motion across cloud apps.  
• **Analyst updates:** Early June 2025 saw several target upgrades: e.g. Susquehanna to $530, Piper to $505 ([www.defenseworld.net](https://www.defenseworld.net/2025/06/18/investment-analysts-recent-ratings-updates-for-crowdstrike-crwd.html#:~:text=,raised%20by%20analysts%20at%20Morgan)), reflecting confidence in long-term model. WestPark and Scotiabank maintained Neutral-type ratings. A handful of firms (Bernstein) have turned cautious on near-term multiples.  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth reflects subscription-based customer additions and expanding module attach. Deceleration in Q1 FY26 (+20%) versus +33% a year prior highlights peer caution amid macro uncertainty. However, CrowdStrike’s losses (GAAP) have turned into substantial profits on a non-GAAP basis: FY2025 revenue grew 29% to $3.954B ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,for%20both)), while non-GAAP net income rose 31% to $987.6M (EPS $3.93) ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,09%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)).  The expansion of subscription gross margin (~80%) and leverage in R&D/SG&A have driven improving cash returns (FY25 FCF margin ~27% of sales ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024))).

For FY2026, guidance implies ~20% revenue growth. We see limited leverage in the first half (higher comps from prior year) with acceleration possible in 2H. Assuming FY26 rev ~$4.77B (midpoint) and non-GAAP EPS ~$3.39 (midpoint of $3.33–3.45 guidances ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,GAAP%20net%20income%20per%20share))) the implied P/E is ~137× at current levels.  EPS upside may come from buybacks and operating efficiency if growth remains healthy.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
CrowdStrike operates in a highly competitive cybersecurity market.  Leading peers include Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), and others. The industry saw exceptionally strong growth, especially as cybersecurity is considered “one area…where businesses can’t afford to skimp on spending” even during downturns ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/21/here-is-my-top-cybersecurity-stock-for-2025/#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20skimp%20out%20on%20spending)).  In terms of scale, Palo Alto (market cap >$100B) is the largest cybersecurity vendor ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/topics/12227/cybersecurity-market-leaders/#:~:text=terms%20of%20market%20capitalization%2C%20eight,become%20one%20of%20the%20leading)).  CrowdStrike sits at the high end of valuation among its peers due to its growth profile. For context: Palo Alto trades around a 117× P/E (non-GAAP) vs. ~47× for Fortinet ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/total-liabilities-share-holders-equity#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,27.23)).  We expect CrowdStrike to behave as a hybrid Growth/Value stock.  It aligns with “Growth” peers by revenue momentum and platform breadth, but its current multiples are nearer to the legendlike PANW (see Valuation).

| **Company**         | **Market Cap** | **1-yr EPS Growth** | **FY P/E (non-GAAP)** | **Operating Margin** | **Our Rating** |
|---------------------|--------------:|--------------------:|----------------------:|---------------------:|---------------:|
| Palo Alto Networks (PANW) | ~$133B      | ~+20%              | ~117× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/total-liabilities-share-holders-equity#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,27.23))      | ~10–15%             | OVERWEIGHT*    |
| Fortinet (FTNT)      | ~$80B        | ~+30%              | ~47× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/total-liabilities-share-holders-equity#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,27.23))       | ~20–25%             | MARKET-PERFORM |
| Check Point (CHKP)   | ~$25B        | ~flat              | ~27×                    | ~25–30%             | OVERWEIGHT     |
| Zscaler (ZS)         | ~$45B        | +40% (high base)   | N/A (loss)             | -                   | OVERWEIGHT     |

*Analyst ratings: “Overweight” implies expected to upper-bound our coverage universe performance.  
_CrowdStrike’s rating: HOLD._  

CrowdStrike’s positioning is skewed toward growth: it trades at a premium to most peers, reflecting its higher growth and platform-led deployment model.  On a Value/Growth map, CRWD is far “Growth” given its ~20–30% revenue growth, while older on-premise players like Check Point (CHKP) are Value.  We believe CrowdStrike must sustain high net retention and expand new AI-driven products to justify its valuation premium.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
CrowdStrike has a very strong balance sheet. As of Apr 30, 2025, cash and equivalents were $4.61B ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial/#:~:text=,61%20billion%C2%A0as%20of%C2%A0April%2030%2C%202025)) against only $0.74B of long-term debt ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/long-term-debt#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)) (net cash ~$3.9B). No dividend is paid; capital is reinvested or returned via buybacks.  Return on tangible equity remains negative (due to historic net losses), but non-GAAP ROA/ROIC are improving. Management emphasizes profitable growth: FY2025 non-GAAP operating income was $837.7M (21% of sales) vs. $660.3M a year earlier ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=was%C2%A0%24837,09%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024)).  Free cash flow has grown sharply (FY2025 FCF $1.07B ([crowdstrike.gcs-web.com](https://crowdstrike.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=,2%20million%C2%A0in%20fiscal%202024))). Given the ample liquidity, improving margins, and no financial stress, we assign a **High** Financial Strength rating.  

# Management & Risks  
CEO/Founder **George Kurtz** and President/Digital Security Officer **Amol Kulkarni** continue to guide strategy; Kurtz has led CrowdStrike since 2011 and remains a large insider holder. **Burt Podbere**, CFO since late 2022, steers financial operations. Management has been transparent about targets (e.g. $10B ARR by FY2029 ([ir.crowdstrike.com](https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDelivering%C2%A0%24224%20million%C2%A0of%20net%20new%20ARR%2C,native%20SOC%20for%20today%20and))) and provides quarterly guidance and milestones.

Risks (each cited where possible):  
• *Competition:* The cybersecurity sector is dominated by well-capitalized incumbents and fast-moving disruptors. Palo Alto Networks remains #1 by market cap ($>100B) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/topics/12227/cybersecurity-market-leaders/#:~:text=terms%20of%20market%20capitalization%2C%20eight,become%20one%20of%20the%20leading)), with Fortinet close behind. Intense competition (from legacy vendors and new SaaS entrants) could pressure pricing and growth.  
• *Macro/Spending:* Although cybersecurity spends are relatively recession-resilient ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/21/here-is-my-top-cybersecurity-stock-for-2025/#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20skimp%20out%20on%20spending)), a prolonged tech downturn or tight IT budgets could slow new deals and cross-sell. Lower net-new ARR than forecast would hurt the high multiple stock.  
• *Tech Execution:* CrowdStrike’s model relies on seamless delivery of cloud security. Operational missteps (e.g. product bugs or outages like the July 2024 update incident) could damage reputation. Continued innovation (Falcon platform enhancements) is critical to retain share against rivals.  
• *Regulatory:* Heightened government scrutiny on AI and data privacy could impose compliance costs. Export controls to certain countries may limit some market opportunities. Data breaches at customers (or at CrowdStrike) could also lead to liability or reputational risk.  
• *Valuation:* With P/E well above 100×, valuation risk is high. Any negative surprise in revenue, retention, or financial execution could lead to sharp stock sell-offs. Conversely, sustained or faster growth would justify the premium.  
• *Currency/Geopolitical:* A significant fraction of revenue is international (Europe, Asia-Pacific). Currency swings or geopolitical tensions could impact sales or conversion rates. The company must navigate diverse regulatory regimes as it expands globally.  

# Company Description  
CrowdStrike Holdings is a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity services. Its Falcon platform delivers real-time endpoint protection, threat intelligence, identity and access management, and cloud workload protection across a unified AI-driven architecture ([www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/21/here-is-my-top-cybersecurity-stock-for-2025/#:~:text=favorite%3A%20CrowdStrike%20%28CRWD%201.32,it%20worth%20buying%20right%20now)). The company serves a global customer base (spanning enterprises, governments, and SMBs in 176 countries) with subscription software, managed services (Falcon OverWatch), and professional solutions. CrowdStrike’s platform is notable for agentic AI analytics and broad module adoption: customers often subscribe to multiple Falcon modules for a “single pane” defense. The company is headquartered in Austin, Texas and has been publicly traded (Nasdaq: CRWD) since 2019.  

# Valuation  
Our $490 target is derived from a blended approach, primarily a multiples comparison to peers. We assume FY2026 adjusted EPS of ~$3.39 (midpoint of guidance) and apply ~120×, implying ~$407, then adjust modestly higher given CrowdStrike’s superior growth trajectory. This multiple is below the ~150× implied by FY2025 non-GAAP EPS consensus, but roughly in line with high-growth peers. For context, Palo Alto trades near 117× (non-GAAP) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRWD/crowdstrike/total-liabilities-share-holders-equity#:~:text=Stock%20Name%20%20,27.23)); Fortinet about 47×. The target implies ~16× FY26 revenue (EV/Rev), versus ~29× currently. On a historical basis, CrowdStrike has ranged much higher (P/E >150× last year), so our multiple assumption reflects some contraction in riders. Upside catalysts would include sustained ARR growth above guidance or retention lifting above 97%. Downside risks include any deceleration in net-new ARR or failure to expand into new security markets. A rating upgrade would require clear evidence of re-accelerating growth or margin outperformance; a downgrade would follow any signs of secular slowdown or intensifying competition.  

# Ratings Reference  
• **BUY:** Expected to outperform broad market (e.g. S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
• **HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
• **SELL:** Expected to underperform broad market on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.

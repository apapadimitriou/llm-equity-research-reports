## Analyst’s Notes  
• **Strong 1Q results:** 1Q25 net income $7.4B ($0.90/share) vs. $6.7B ($0.76) a year ago ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20reported%20strong,2)), revenue $27.4B (≈+6% YoY). EPS beat consensus.  
• **Revenue drivers:** NII rose ~3% to $14.4B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=interest%20income%20,NII%20by%20the%20fourth%20quarter)); Markets revenue up ~9% as equity trading hit a record $2.2B and FICC $3.5B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=compared%20to%20%246,Net)). Conversely, IB fees fell ~3% ($1.5B) amid deal slowdowns ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Despite%20strong%20trading%20performance%2C%20investment,in%20credit%20loss%20provisions%20and)).  
• **Credit and expenses:** Provisions for credit losses ~$1.48B (vs $1.32B LY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Despite%20strong%20trading%20performance%2C%20investment,in%20credit%20loss%20provisions%20and)). Non-interest expense up ~3%; efficiency ratio ~55% (versus low‐50s a year ago). Costs include ongoing compliance and branch investments.  
• **Guidance:** Management reaffirmed FY25 net interest income target of $15.5–$15.7B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=interest%20income%20,NII%20by%20the%20fourth%20quarter)); expects record NII for 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expects-record-net-interest-income-2025-2025-02-11/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20anticipates%20achieving,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202025)). No changes to other guidance. Analysts have slightly raised FY2025 EPS estimates on the beat.  
• **Capital returns:** CET1 capital ~11.8% post‐Q1 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=31%2C%202025%20is%20lower%20than,its%20CET1%20capital%20ratio%20requirement)), supporting ~$9B of remaining buybacks. Q2 dividend held at $0.26/share (≈3.0% yield) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=quarterly%20common%20stock%20dividend%20of,as%20of%20June%206%2C%202025)). Shares rose ~1.6% on the earnings surprise ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=implemented%20workforce%20reductions%2C%20including%20senior,the%20announcement%20of%20new%20tariffs)).  
• **Macro context:** Pre-earnings, BAC stock was ~12% below Feb 2025 levels due to tariff fears ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=implemented%20workforce%20reductions%2C%20including%20senior,the%20announcement%20of%20new%20tariffs)). 1Q results partially offset this: trading gains from short-term volatility helped boost Markets revenue ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-stocks-sink-trumps-tariffs-cloud-dealmaking-loan-demand-2025-04-03/#:~:text=U,Investors%20are)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=compared%20to%20%246,2)), even as executives cautioned that trade wars risk weaker loan demand ahead.  

## Investment Thesis  
Bank of America is a franchise banking model with diversified earnings.  Rising interest rates are driving higher net interest margins (BofA forecasts NII growth ~6–7% in 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expects-record-net-interest-income-2025-2025-02-11/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20anticipates%20achieving,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202025))), and its large deposit base locks in favorable funding.  The bank’s consumer division (deposit, card and mortgage services) and Global Wealth arm (Merrill) generate stable fees; Merrill’s assets under management (~$1.86T at Mar-25 ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=Total%20assets%20under%20management%2C%20end,1%2C730%2C005))) underpin recurring investment income.  BofA has invested heavily in digital delivery (leading apps, Zelle) and a 4,300-branch network, giving it strong customer reach.  Its efficiency ratio has averaged ~53% lately, allowing material operating leverage: cost controls and modest credit costs help free cash flow.  With a $1.04 annual dividend (yield ~3%) and ongoing share buybacks, BofA returns capital aggressively while still funding growth.  

Long-term growth drivers include rising household wealth, cross-border transaction flows and corporate financing needs.  Near-term catalysts are robust Treasury/FX trading revenues (BofA’s Global Markets business is well-positioned to capture market volatility) and recovery in investment banking fees as M&A picks up.  The bank’s growth outlook remains solid: it has guided for low‐single-digit loan growth, but strong treasury services and loan originations in commercial banking should help.  Key assumptions: stable credit quality (loan losses normalized), and that higher rates persist.  Under this thesis, BofA’s valuation will reset higher as earnings power becomes clearer.  

## Recent Developments  
- **April 15, 2025:** 1Q25 earnings – net income $7.4B ($0.90) vs $6.7B a year ago ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20reported%20strong,2)); total revenue $27.366B (net of interest) also beat consensus.  Markets division revenue was strongest in over a decade.  Management reiterated FY25 NII guidance ($15.5–$15.7B) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=interest%20income%20,NII%20by%20the%20fourth%20quarter)).  
- **April 15, 2025:** Dividend – Board approved Q2’25 dividend of $0.26 (no change) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=quarterly%20common%20stock%20dividend%20of,as%20of%20June%206%2C%202025)), consistent with ~$1.04/year at a ~3% yield.  Share repurchase program (originally $10B annual run-rate) is ongoing (roughly $9B remained authorization at Q1-end).  
- **Regulatory/Legal:** In October 2024 BofA reported it is negotiating with the CFPB over a Zelle fraud probe ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/bofa-considers-suing-us-consumer-watchdog-over-zelle-inquiry-2024-10-29/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20,not%20expect%20significant%20financial%20impacts)).  No resolutions disclosed yet.  The bank’s continued regulatory compliance efforts (AML/BSA) are ongoing with minimal expected P&L impact.  
- **Other:**  No major M&A or executive changes.  Management highlighted trade-war uncertainties; notable was JPMorgan’s warning on tariffs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-profit-jumps-dealmaking-trading-boost-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Despite%20these%20strong%20financial%20results%2C,inflation%20and%20high%20fiscal%20deficits)).  Fed stress test results are expected in mid-2025 (likely coinciding with any new buyback authorization).  

## Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth is driven by higher asset yields and transaction volumes.  We expect full-year 2025 revenue to rise modestly (~3–5%) as NII improves further (appendix table shows a ~6% increase in 2024 vs 2023).  Markets and trading revenue is volatile but trending up; investment banking fees are cyclical (currently low).  Operating leverage is moderate – expense growth has historically run low-single-digits due to cost controls.  Credit cost trends are stable; the reserve build was modest in 1Q25.  

FY25 EPS Bridge (vs FY24): BofA’s EPS should grow in low-double-digits. Key changes: (+) higher net interest income (driven by asset fooating vs liability costs), (+) higher trading and investment gains, (+) steady fee income (wealth management), partially offset by (−) slightly higher efficiency ratio (as costs nudge up) and (−) normalized tax rate. We forecast diluted EPS rising from ~$3.3 in 2024 to ~$3.7 in 2025 (≈12% growth).

## Peer & Industry Analysis  
Among large U.S. bank peers (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman, etc.), BofA is relatively a *value* play on the Value/Growth spectrum.  BofA’s FY24 EPS grew ~18% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20reported%20strong,2)), driven by interest/trading; for comparison, Citi’s EPS rose ~21% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citigroup-profit-surges-stock-trading-jumps-23-2025-04-15/#:~:text=rise%20in%20equity%20trading%20revenue,96%20per%20share)), Goldman ~15% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-profit-jumps-traders-deliver-gains-2025-04-14/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20reported%20a%2015,to)), JPMorgan ~9% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-profit-jumps-dealmaking-trading-boost-2025-04-11/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,91%20per%20share%2C%20outpacing%20estimates)), and Wells Fargo ~6% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20reported%20a%206,workforce%20reductions%20while%20investing%20in)).  Our peers trade across P/Es: Goldman and MS (more growth/earnings volatility) at ~8–10×, while more leveraged banks like Citi are in the high single-digits.  BofA at ~12× 2025 EPS is mid-pack, with an above-average dividend (~3%) supporting value. BofA’s return on equity (~10%) falls below JPMorgan’s (~14%) but above Citi’s (~9%) (see table below with market cap and key stats). On a growth vs. value chart, BofA sits left of high-growth banks like MS and GS, reflecting its steadier rental yield and capital returns.

| Company         | Market Cap | 1-year EPS % | 2025E P/E | ROE (%) | Our Rating |
|-----------------|-----------:|-------------:|----------:|--------:|-----------|
| **Bank of America (BAC)** | 315B     | +18% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-profit-rises-trading-strength-2025-04-15/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20reported%20strong,2))   | ~12×     | ~10%   | BUY       |

BofA’s relative positioning (lower P/E, higher yield) skews it toward the *value* side of the sector.  In contrast, Morgan Stanley and Goldman (higher P/E) are on the growth side of the industry.  

## Financial Strength & Dividend  
BofA maintains a solid balance sheet.  As of Mar-25, CET1 ratio was 11.8% ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=31%2C%202025%20is%20lower%20than,its%20CET1%20capital%20ratio%20requirement)) (well above regulatory minima), Tier-1 ~12%.  Liquidity is ample (high quality liquid assets ~$300B vs short-term deposits), and loan-to-deposit ≈0.9.  Debt ratios are conservative for a bank.  In Q1’25 the company paid $1.9B in common dividends (~$0.26/qtr) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1660%20of%202025%2C,9%20billion)), reflecting a dividend payout ratio ~27%.  The dividend has grown from $0.24 in 2024Q1 to $0.26 (3% yield on current price) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=quarterly%20common%20stock%20dividend%20of,as%20of%20June%206%2C%202025)).  BofA’s robust capital allows continued buybacks (authorizations of ~$9B remain).  Given its capital adequacy, high-quality asset base, and consistent payout, we rate BofA’s financial strength **Medium-High**.  

## Management & Risks  
CEO Brian Moynihan (2010–present) and CFO Paul Donofrio (2022–present) have long tenures, contributing to stable strategy execution.  Guidance is straightforward with regular updates tied to Fed stress tests.  Key risks include: • **Trade/Geopolitics:** Tariff-driven slowdowns could hit loan growth and IB activity; bank CEOs have warned of recession risks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-stocks-sink-trumps-tariffs-cloud-dealmaking-loan-demand-2025-04-03/#:~:text=U,Investors%20are)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-profit-jumps-dealmaking-trading-boost-2025-04-11/#:~:text=Despite%20these%20strong%20financial%20results%2C,inflation%20and%20high%20fiscal%20deficits)).  • **Interest rate risk:** A rapid Fed easing would compress NII – e.g., Wells Fargo noted a 6% NII drop on expected cuts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-profit-rises-wealth-management-strength-2025-04-11/#:~:text=growth%2C%20creating%20an%20uncertain%20outlook,orders%20closed%20in%202025%20and)).  • **Credit risk:** Consumer/corporate credit losses could rise if the economy weakens or inflation persists.  • **Regulatory:** BofA faces a CFPB probe into its Zelle fraud controls ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/bofa-considers-suing-us-consumer-watchdog-over-zelle-inquiry-2024-10-29/#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20,not%20expect%20significant%20financial%20impacts)); future enforcement or fines are possible.  • **Competition:** FinTech and non-bank lenders continue to pressure fee income and deposits.  

## Company Description  
Bank of America Corp. is a global financial services company.  It provides a full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products and services.  Main divisions include Consumer Banking (deposits, loans, mortgages, credit cards, digital banking), Global Wealth & Investment Management (Merrill Lynch wealth advisory, Bank of America Private Bank, with ~55m retail clients and ~$1.9T AUM ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANK-OF-AMERICA-CORPORATI-11751/news/Bank-of-America-Form-10-Q-for-the-first-quarter-2025-49782163/#:~:text=Total%20assets%20under%20management%2C%20end,1%2C730%2C005))), Global Banking (corporate lending, treasury, investment banking) and Global Markets (sales, trading, market-making).  BofA operates in all 50 U.S. states (≈4,300 branches) and in over 30 countries, serving individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations. The company’s diversified model and scale give it broad exposure to U.S. consumer spending and corporate activity.  

## Valuation  
Our $48 target is based primarily on forward multiples relative to historic averages.  At ~$48, BofA would trade at ~14× 2025 EPS (≈$3.5/sh), roughly its 5-year mean. This is below the average valuation of big banks (consensus ~$15–16×), implying moderate upside. Comparatively, BAC’s target P/B ~1.4× (vs. 1.0× five-year avg) suggests limited growth priced in.  We see asymmetric upside: outperformance in trading or stronger loan growth could re-rate the stock higher, whereas persistent margin pressure or rising credit costs would justify a lower multiple. A sustained deterioration in asset quality or regulatory shocks would trigger a downgrade.  

## Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform on a total return basis vs. broad market (top‐quartile on a 12-month horizon, risk-adjusted).  
- **HOLD:** Anticipated to perform roughly in line with the market (middle of the pack, neutral expected return).  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform the market (bottom‐quartile returns, higher risk).  

*Rating: BUY (12-month); 5-year outlook: Overweight (long-term positive bias); Sector stance: Market-Weight (neutral stance on banks).*  

## Methodology & Disclaimers  
We use a combined top-down/bottom-up approach.  Macroeconomic and industry trends (interest rates, GDP, banking sector health) set the backdrop, while company fundamentals (loan/deposit growth, NII, fees, expenses, capital ratios) drive our financial model.  Valuation is derived through peer‐multiple analysis and discounted cash flow benchmarks. Financial strength, management quality, and risk assessment are integral to our forecast.  This report is based on information available as of the report date. It is not a recommendation to buy or sell securities, nor is it offered as individualized investment advice.

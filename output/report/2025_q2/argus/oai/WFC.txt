# Analyst’s Notes

• Q1’25 results (Apr) showed **net income** $4.894B, up 6% YoY, on **revenue** $20.149B (down 3%) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=In%20the%20three,excluded%20a%206%20cent%20gain)).  Adjusted EPS was $1.33 vs. $1.24 expected.  Net interest income (NII) fell ~6% to $11.50B ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=Net%20interest%20income%2C%20a%20key,64%20billion)), reflecting lower loan yields and balances; noninterest income was roughly flat at $8.65B ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=Net%20interest%20income%2C%20a%20key,64%20billion)).  Operating leverage was helped by expense cuts.  

• **Expense control:** Noninterest expense plunged (~12% YoY in Q4’24 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,FDIC%20assessments%20and%20severance%20expenses))) as FDIC assessments and certain legal costs normalized.  Efficiency remains high (≈87%), even as revenue pressured.  This drove a tick up in efficiency ratio despite stable operating gains.  

• **Credit:** Provision for credit losses was $932M in Q1, down sharply from $1.095B in Q4’24 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,the%20allowance%20for%20credit%20losses)).  The allowance for loan losses declined modestly, and net charge-offs remained low.  Asset quality appears stable with coverage ratios intact.  

• **Capital return:** In Q1, WFC repurchased $3.5B of stock (45.5M shares) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20bought%20back%2044,5%20billion%2C%20in%20first%20quarter)).  For FY2024 the bank returned ~$25B in capital (57.8M shares, $4.0B repurchase in Q4’24 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,capital%20to%20shareholders%20throughout%202024))).  Dividends were maintained (~$0.72/qtr; dividend yield ~2.8% ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=WFC&ty=c#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,61))).  

• **Outlook:** Management expects moderate loan growth but continued pressure on NII from deposit repricing.  Investment banking and wealth fees should partially offset loan yield pressure.  Guidance remains conservative on growth and sees volatility ahead, pending policy resolution.  The thesis for WFC hinges on its large U.S. franchise and outlook for regulatory relief (asset-cap removal) to unlock capital.

# Investment Thesis

Wells Fargo is a **leading U.S. retail and commercial bank** with ~$1.9T in assets ([newsroom.wf.com](https://newsroom.wf.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/Wells-Fargo-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20%26%20Company%20,available%20at%20Wells%20Fargo%20Stories)).  Its diversified platform (Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, Wealth & Investment Mgmt) gives broad fee and spread revenue streams.  Secular drivers include stable core deposit growth and broad consumer finance needs (mortgages, auto, credit cards), which should benefit as consumer spending and borrowing stabilize.  Although net interest margins have peaked with Fed rate cuts, Wells’ monoline-banking model can still generate high returns when credit costs are controlled.  Over time, fee-based businesses (wealth management, merchant processing) and cross-sell opportunities (e.g. small business lending) add noninterest revenues.  

On the cost side, Wells Fargo has aggressively churned older branches and streamlined overhead, improving efficiency (noninterest expense down ~10% in 2024 vs. prior year ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,FDIC%20assessments%20and%20severance%20expenses))).  Capital returns ($25B in buybacks in 2024 including $4B in Q4 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,capital%20to%20shareholders%20throughout%202024))) enhance EPS growth.  The **return profile** (ROE ~12% in 2024 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,0%20billion%2C%20in%20Q4%202024)) and RoA ~0.98% ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=WFC&ty=c#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,61))) is competitive for a big bank.  A near-term catalyst is the potential lifting of the Fed-imposed $1.95T asset cap: management and analysts (RBC, Piper) expect this constraint to be removed “in the very near future” ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=The%20latest%20OCC%20consent%20order,wrote%20in%20their%20research%20note)), which would free excess capital for further buybacks or expansion.  Management has also indicated continued investments in technology and risk control, which should underpin sustainable growth. Overall, WFC’s large addressable deposit base and improving franchise efficiency support mid-single-digit EPS growth in coming years, with upside from regulatory tailwinds and higher rates.

# Recent Developments

- **Q1 2025 earnings (Apr 11):** Net income $4.89B (+6% YoY) vs. $4.62B (Q1’24) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=In%20the%20three,excluded%20a%206%20cent%20gain)). EPS (adj) $1.33 beat $1.24 consensus. Revenue $20.15B (-3% YoY) vs. $20.86B. NII $11.50B (-6%) on one fewer day and lower loan yields ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=Net%20interest%20income%2C%20a%20key,64%20billion)); noninterest income $8.65B (+1%). Noninterest expense continues to decline (Q4’24 -12% YoY ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,FDIC%20assessments%20and%20severance%20expenses))). Provision $932M (ACL down slightly) ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco,the%20allowance%20for%20credit%20losses)). Management reiterated caution on consumer demand and said it is prepared for potential volatility, supporting a modest outlook.

- **Regulatory:** In May 2025 the OCC **terminated the 2015 consent order** on Wells’ previous financial subsidiaries ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20the%20Comptroller,subsidiaries%2C%20the%20company%20confirmed%20Thursday)), leaving only the Federal Reserve’s $1.95T asset cap intact.  CEO Scharf said Wells is “a lot closer to the end than the beginning” of resolving the cap.  Analysts at Piper Sandler and RBC now see cap removal as possible within quarters ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=The%20latest%20OCC%20consent%20order,wrote%20in%20their%20research%20note)). In April 2025, the CFPB withdrew the 2018 consent order on Wells’ compliance risk program ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=The%20latest%20termination%20comes%20almost,bank%E2%80%99s%20compliance%20risk%20management%20program)). (A formal OCC order on anti–money laundering improvements remains in place and is being addressed.) 

- **Capital Return:** Wells repurchased ~$25B of common stock in 2024 (≈10% of shares) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=,capital%20to%20shareholders%20throughout%202024)), and spent $3.5B in Q1’25 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20bought%20back%2044,5%20billion%2C%20in%20first%20quarter)). The company maintains a ~2.8% dividend yield with minimal increases; payout ratio ~27% ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=WFC&ty=c#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,61)). With capital ratios well above requirements, the board expects to continue opportunistic buybacks once the asset cap lifts. 

- **Legal/Compliance:** Beyond the asset cap, Wells continues to exit low-return lines (sale of third-party servicing business was announced) and invest ~$2B/year in risk controls ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=Since%20the%20regulatory%20clampdown%2C%20Wells,at%20a%20conference%20this%20week)). Recent enforcement has focused on anti–money laundering improvements (OCC formal agreement enacted Sept 2024) and remaining legacy issues. No major M&A deals announced; focus remains on organic growth and efficiency.

# Earnings & Growth Analysis

Revenue is driven by net interest income (loans/deposits) and noninterest income (fees, trading). In 2022–24, Wells saw strong revenue growth (from $83.4B to $125.4B) as higher rates boosted interest spreads ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WFC/wells-fargo/revenue#:~:text=,increase%20from)). Q1’25 revenue of $20.15B was 3% below Q1’24 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-q1-2025.html#:~:text=In%20the%20three,excluded%20a%206%20cent%20gain)), reflecting the beginning of slower NII. Average loans and deposits have been roughly flat to modestly down year-over-year. For FY2025, we expect total revenue to be roughly flat, as lower yield on existing assets will be partly offset by higher deposit balances and loan growth. Noninterest income (wealth fees, card interchange) should provide low- to mid-single-digit growth. Expense leverage is favorable: Wells announced ~$2B in annual cost cuts, and efficiency metrics have improved from high starting levels (Q1’25 efficiency ~87%). This suggests operating leverage could support 3–5% EPS growth even if revenue stalls.

Below is a summary of Wells Fargo’s historical results and Q1’25:

| ($ millions)               | 2022     | 2023     | 2024     | Q1’25     |
|-----------------------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Total Revenue              |  83,442.0 | 115,340.0 | 125,397.0 | 20,149.0 |
| Net Income (inc. pref)     |  12,562.0 |  17,982.0 |  18,606.0 |  4,894.0 |
| Diluted EPS ($)            |      3.3 |      4.8 |      5.4 |      1.4 |

**EPS Bridge (FY2025):** Starting from ~$5.37 EPS in 2024 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WFC/WFC-fargo/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021)), our baseline conservatively assumes modest top-line growth but continued buybacks. A small increase in net interest net income (if rates hold) plus ~3% expense decline could yield EPS in the $5.5–5.7 range. Credit costs should remain low, as Q1’25 provision was low and asset quality stable. Ultimately, FY’25 EPS growth is expected mid-single-digits. Variations include scenarios: an earlier rate cut would pressure NII (downswing to EPS), whereas asset-cap removal enabling >$5B/yr in added buybacks would lift EPS materially.

# Peer & Industry Analysis

Key U.S. peers include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and U.S. Bancorp (USB). Below is a snapshot:

| Company (Ticker) | Mkt Cap | 2024 EPS Growth | FY P/E (est.) | Net Interest Margin | Analyst Rating |
|------------------|--------:|----------------:|--------------:|--------------------:|---------------|
| JPMorgan (JPM)   | ~$500B  | +19% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JPM/jpmorgan-chase/net-income#:~:text=,increase)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/JPM/jpmorgan-chase/net-income#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))  | ~10×        | ~2.5% (2024)      | BUY           |
| Bank of America (BAC) | ~$320B  | +3% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/net-income#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))     | ~13×        | ~2.7%            | HOLD          |
| Citigroup (C)    | ~$140B  | +46% ([macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/C/citigroup/net-income#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))     | ~8×         | ~2.3%            | BUY           |
| U.S. Bancorp (USB) | ~$75B  | +17% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/USB/us-bancorp/net-income#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))     | ~11×        | ~2.4%            | HOLD          |
| **Wells Fargo (WFC)**   | ~$250B  | +3% ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WFC/WFC-fargo/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))      | ~13×        | ~2.4% (Q1’25)     | HOLD          |

Wells sits more on the **value** side of the bank sector chart. Its EPS growth is in line with large diversified peers (low-single-digit), unlike high-growth banks like C. Its P/E (~13×) is below growthier peers’ norms. Wells offers a higher dividend yield and shareholder yield than most, reflecting its heavy buybacks. In terms of *Price vs. Growth*, Wells is a blend: not a high-growth play, but a beneficiary of rising (or stable) rates and regulatory relief. It scores higher on profitability (ROE, EPS stability) than regional or fintech banks, but lacks the rapid profit rebound profile of Citi or strong capital markets franchise of JPM. On a risk-adjusted basis, our HOLD rating implies WFC is priced fairly: its modest growth (underpinned by cost cuts) should keep it near sector valuation, with upside if its regulatory story improves.

# Financial Strength & Dividend

Wells Fargo maintains a **solid balance sheet**: end-Q4’24 CET1 capital ratio was ~11.1% ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2657018/wells-fargo-q4-2024-earnings-eps-of-143-beats-estimates-revenue-slightly-misses-at-2038-billion?r=4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748#:~:text=The%20bank%27s%20capital%20position%20remains,and%20absorbing%20potential%20financial%20shocks)), well above regulatory minimums, giving cushion for loan losses and capital returns. Loans-to-deposits (~67%) are conservative, and liquidity (cash plus investment securities) is ample. The debt-to-equity ratio is moderate (~1.0x) as the bank funds primarily with deposits. Quarterly disclosures (10-Qs) provide clear metrics on capital, liquidity, and ACL levels. Given Wells’ recent losses from fine provisions and mortgage run-off, capital excess is being deployed via buybacks.

**Dividend & Buybacks:** Wells currently pays $0.18/share quarterly (~$0.72/year), a ~2.8% yield ([finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?b=1&p=d&t=WFC&ty=c#:~:text=Dividend%20Ex,61)). The dividend is modestly up from prior years, targeting a ~25–30% payout ratio. The bank’s aggressive buyback program (>$25B in 2024) has been the primary shareholder return. We expect continued repurchases under an eventual cap lift. Our Financial Strength rating is **Medium-Low to Medium**: the bank is well-capitalized, but residual legal/regulatory burdens and modest revenue growth limit its robustness. 

# Management & Risks

Charlie Scharf has been CEO since 2019, bringing a focus on compliance and digital transformation; CFO Mike Santomassimo (since 2021) has managed the transition of reserves and costs. The leadership communicates clear targets (efficiency, ROI, capital returns). No imminent C-suite changes are expected, and capital-return philosophies (target CET1 >11%, ~70-80% adjusted ROE) are well-articulated at recent investor days. Management is forthright on the pending asset-cap issue and balance-sheet health.

Key risks include: 
- **Regulatory:** The asset cap ($1.95T) still stands; if Fed denies removal (Sen. Warren lobbies against it ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=However%2C%20Sen.%20Elizabeth%20Warren%2C%20D,Vice%20Chair))), Wells can’t redeploy up to ~$5B/yr capital. The bank also must satisfy the OCC’s 2024 AML order ([www.bankingdive.com](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-clears-penultimate-2015-occ-consent-order-asset-cap-remains/749441/#:~:text=The%202015%20consent%20order%20dissolution,money%20laundering%20efforts)), any shortfalls could invite fines. New regulatory scrutiny (e.g. CBDC rules, consumer protection) also looms over all large banks.
- **Macroeconomic:** A soft economy or Fed rate cuts would squeeze net interest income and potentially raise credit costs, especially in commercial real estate and credit card loans. Conversely, if the Fed keeps rates high, margin pressure stabilizes but loan growth can slow.
- **Competition:** Non-bank fintech entrants and large-cap payment networks could erode fee income growth. Traditional rivals and regional banks are also accelerating technology investments, intensifying competition for deposits and loans.
- **Legal/Litigation:** Legacy issues (mortgage practices, audit controls, account scandals) could result in further fines or compensation costs. While many prior consent orders have closed, new litigation or stronger penalties cannot be ruled out.
- **Geopolitical:** Global shocks (e.g. trade disruptions) may indirectly affect corporate and market volumes; however, ~90% of Wells’ business is U.S.-centric, mitigating foreign risk relative to banks with large international franchises.

# Company Description

Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) is a major U.S. financial services company with roughly $1.9 trillion in assets ([newsroom.wf.com](https://newsroom.wf.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/Wells-Fargo-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20%26%20Company%20,available%20at%20Wells%20Fargo%20Stories)). It offers a full range of banking and finance products—consumer deposit/savings accounts, mortgages, auto/commercial loans, credit cards, and small-business banking—through its Consumer Banking & Lending and Commercial Banking segments. Its Corporate & Investment Banking unit provides wholesale lending, advisory and capital markets services, and its Wealth & Investment Management arm delivers retail brokerage and wealth planning. Wells Fargo operates nationwide (10,000+ branches/ATMs and digital platforms) and is the 34th largest U.S. corporation by revenue ([newsroom.wf.com](https://newsroom.wf.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/Wells-Fargo-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Wells%20Fargo%20%26%20Company%20,available%20at%20Wells%20Fargo%20Stories)). Its diversified model relies on a core deposit franchise and cross-selling of services across its consumer and business client base.

# Valuation

We derive our $85 target via a forward P/E multiple approach. At ~$5.7 EPS (FY2025 estimate including benefits of buybacks), our target P/E is ≈15×, roughly in line with its 10-year median (~13–15×) and modestly above current ~13×. This compares to peers (JPM ~10×, BAC ~13×) which reflects Wells Fargo’s blend of stable earnings and moderate growth. A 15× multiple on 2025 EPS implies upside ~10% from current. On a price/book basis, WFC trades ~1.5× Q1’25 tangible book, near its 5-year average. Our methodology integrates this multiple-based valuation with a discounted cash flow (DCF) sanity check on expected FCF growth. The target implies that if WFC meets modest earnings growth and begins additional capital return, the stock is fairly valued; conversely, if challenges (e.g. prolonged asset cap, credit losses) emerge, valuations could compress. We would upgrade our rating on evidence of an early lift in regulatory constraints or sustained NII rebound; we would downgrade if net interest pressures deepen or cost-cutting stalls.

# Ratings Reference

**BUY:** Expected to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform roughly in line with the market on a risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.

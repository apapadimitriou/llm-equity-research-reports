### Analyst’s Notes  
• **Q1 FY2026 Results** – Snowflake delivered robust 26% revenue growth ($1.00B, up 26% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,as%20of%20April%2030%2C%202025)).  Product revenue was $996.8M (26% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,as%20of%20April%2030%2C%202025)).  Net revenue retention remained high at 124% ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,month%20product%20revenue)).  Key enterprise metrics: 606 customers spending ≥$1M (up 27% YoY) and 754 Global 2000 customers (up 4% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=growth,Global%202000%20customers%2C%20representing%2027)).  Remaining Performance Obligations (billings) grew 34% to $6.7B ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=The%20company%20now%20has%20606,year%20growth.%20See%20the%20section)), signaling future revenue visibility.  
• **Guidance Raise; AI Tailwinds** – The company raised its FY2026 product revenue guide to $4.325B (25% YoY) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=Snowflake%20has%20raised%20its%20fiscal,Snowflake%20reported%20a)).  Q2 FY26 product revenue is guided at $1,035–1,040M (25% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Non,371)), above consensus.  Management cited strong demand from AI initiatives and partnerships (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) that “enhance the platform’s appeal” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=billion%20consensus%20estimate.%20Snowflake%27s%20AI,have%20significantly%20contributed%20to%20the)).  Adjusted operating income was $91.7M (9% margin) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=,9)), and non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 beat $0.21 consensus ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=and%20increased%20enterprise%20cloud%20adoption,of%2021%20cents%20per%20share)).  Operating leverage is emerging – FCF was $206M (20% of revenue) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,20)).  
• **Platform Adoption** – Customers continue expanding use of Snowflake’s data cloud. New features (e.g. native AI tools, expanded Snowpipe Streaming) and cross-sell (Customer 360, cybersecurity analytics) support upsell.  The shift to a pay-for-use model ensures consumption growth; effective discounts may have moderated YoY net revenue but support multi-year contracts.  
• **Capital Deployment** – Board authorized a $4.5B buyback program (additional $2.5B approved Aug’24) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=of%20directors%20authorized%20the%20repurchase,set%20trading)); ~0.5M shares have been repurchased through Q1 ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=match%20at%20L1886%20stock%20repurchases,the%20stockholders%E2%80%99%20equity%20on%20the)).  No dividend.  Strong cash generation (~$228M cash from ops in Q1) supports continued share repurchases.  
• **Catalysts / Concerns** – Continued penetration into regulated industries and international markets (e.g., new LA28 Olympics deal announced May 27, 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/la28-brings-snowflake-data-collaboration-provider-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Snowflake%2C%20a%20data%20cloud%20analytics,health%20records%2C%20nutrition%20tracking%2C%20and))) could accelerate growth.  Risks include macro-driven IT spend slowdowns and fierce competition from other cloud/data platforms.  

### Investment Thesis  
Snowflake is a leading cloud data platform poised to benefit from secular data and AI trends.  The shift to cloud analytics and AI-driven decisioning underpins a large total addressable market. Management estimates Snowflake’s TAM in the hundreds of billions (from data warehousing, lakes, exchange, and AI apps).  We believe Snowflake can maintain revenue growth in the mid-20% range by capitalizing on: (1) **Data-driven IT spending:** Enterprises are store vast data across clouds—Snowflake’s multi-cloud Snowflake Data Cloud is designed for anywhere data access and SQL analytics.  (2) **AI and apps:** New AI products (e.g. embedded ML frameworks, App Marketplace) are unlocking higher spend per customer.  Partnerships with AI firms (OpenAI, Anthropic) and cloud providers extend stickiness ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=billion%20consensus%20estimate.%20Snowflake%27s%20AI,have%20significantly%20contributed%20to%20the)).  (3) **High retention/expansion:** Net revenue retention (~124%) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,month%20product%20revenue)) implies existing customers expand usage.  
Snowflake’s gross margin (~76% non-GAAP) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=,9)) and improving operating leverage mean profit conversion should grow over time.  Q1’s non-GAAP OI was 9% of revenue, but we expect steady margin expansion as scale offsets infrastructure costs.  Free cash flow is strong (20% of revenue in Q1) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,20)), supporting the $4.5B share buyback program ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=of%20directors%20authorized%20the%20repurchase,set%20trading)).  No dividend, but accumulated shareholders' equity is rising (cash + AOCI vs net losses).  
**Monetization vectors:** Snowflake monetizes via usage (compute credits for queries), subscription (flat fees for capacity/remain obligations), and marketplace/analytics add-ons (data marketplace, consumption of Snowflake-built apps). The platform’s product pillars include core data warehousing/lakes, Snowpark data engineering, Snowflake for enabling AI/ML, and the Data Marketplace for third-party data/apps. Growth in each pillar supports the unified value proposition. We also note synergy with existing data-heavy customers (e.g. high-tech, finance, GenAI startups using Snowflake analytics).   
Near-term catalysts include expanding use cases like IoT analytics and data apps on the platform, and cross-sell into professional services data (besides core production workloads).  Snowflake’s broad cloud partnerships (AWS, Azure, GCP) give it global reach, and its customer base includes 754 Global 2000 firms ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=growth,Global%202000%20customers%2C%20representing%2027)), underscoring the enterprise footprint. While valuations are high, we see continued long-term upside as Snowflake converts more of the massive data workload market.  

### Recent Developments *(all pre–2025-05-28)*  
- **May 21, 2025 (Q1 FY2026):** Product revenue $996.8M (+26% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,as%20of%20April%2030%2C%202025)); Total revenue $1.04B (+26%).  Q1 non-GAAP EPS $0.24 beat $0.21  ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=and%20increased%20enterprise%20cloud%20adoption,of%2021%20cents%20per%20share)).  Net revenue retention 124% ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20the%20quarter%20was,month%20product%20revenue)).  RPO $6.7B (+34% YoY) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=The%20company%20now%20has%20606,year%20growth.%20See%20the%20section)).  Board raised FY26 guidance to $4.325B product rev (+25%) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=%7C%20Full,millions%29)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2025-05-21/#:~:text=Snowflake%20has%20raised%20its%20fiscal,Snowflake%20reported%20a)); Q2 guide ~$1.038B (up 25%) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Non,371)).  
- **May 27, 2025:** Snowflake announced partnership as official data collaboration platform for 2028 LA Olympics ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/la28-brings-snowflake-data-collaboration-provider-2025-05-27/#:~:text=Snowflake%2C%20a%20data%20cloud%20analytics,health%20records%2C%20nutrition%20tracking%2C%20and)), highlighting brand visibility and product adoption for large-scale data use (athlete performance, fan engagement).  
- **Q4 FY25 (Feb 26, 2025):** (Per prior releases) Snowflake reported in Feb 2025: Q4 product rev ~$890M, FY25 ~$3.25B (achieved prior guidance). (Not updated with Q4 figures here due to cutoff.)  
- **Strategic alliances:** In late 2024, Snowflake formed or expanded AI partnerships, e.g. with Anthropic & Google Cloud, to integrate LLMs into the data cloud (Nov 2024) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/snowflake-raises-annual-product-revenue-forecast-2024-11-20/#:~:text=Snowflake%20has%20increased%20its%20annual,to%20perform%20deep%20data%20analysis)).  Snowflake also signed notable deals with large enterprises (e.g. financial services consortia).  
- **Regulatory / Legal:** No major regulatory issues reported. Privacy and data-sovreignty rules (e.g. GDPR) remain a general sector risk.  
- **Buybacks / Capital:** Board extended stock buyback program ($2.5B added Aug 2024 ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=of%20directors%20authorized%20the%20repurchase,set%20trading))).  As of Q1 ~0.5M shares repurchased under the program ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=match%20at%20L1886%20stock%20repurchases,the%20stockholders%E2%80%99%20equity%20on%20the)); remaining authorization is ample. No dividends declared. Financing remains prudent (issued $2.3B convertible notes in Sept 2024 per notes in 10-Q).  

### Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth is driven by usage expansion with existing customers and new large accounts.  The 26% Q1 topline growth is above the 2-yr trend (FY24 was ~26% also) as AI & cross-platform demand picks up.  Longer-term, we model ~25% annual growth in FY26-27 assuming continued enterprise adoption.  Cross-sell of new Snowflake products (Snowpark, Unistore, etc.) should boost shelf space.  Price increases (for storage and surplus compute) are limited; growth comes mainly from volume of data/queries.  We do not expect material DSO swings; billings remain robust (RPO up 34%).  
Incentives are high in this sector, so Snowflake offers usage credits and large contracts.  We assume moderation of discount rates after recent hires of sales teams; gross retention is high, but net retention can dip as discounting increases.  We note operating leverage: each additional $100M rev contributes ~33M to GAAP gross profit.  However, SG&A (especially stock comp) grows with headcount, so operating leverage is moderate.  Over time, as SG&A growth normalizes, non-GAAP operating margins should expand above the current low-teens (we forecast ~15–20% by FY2027).  GAAP net loss will persist in near term due to stock compensation, but adjusted EPS is positive and rising.  
**EPS Bridge FY25:** For FY2025 (year ended Jan ’25), revenue was ~$4.0B (assuming product rev ~$3.25B plus services) and GAAP net loss widened vs FY24 (loss ~$430M in FY25 vs $318M in FY24 ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Net%20loss%20%20,%24))).  The additional loss was mainly from higher stock-based comp and amortization (collapsing GAAP EPS from –$0.95 to –$1.29 ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Net%20loss%20%20,%24))).  On a non-GAAP basis, FY25 adjusted EPS was modestly positive (~10c) vs 4c prior year.  For FY2026 (ending Jan ’26) we expect net sales ~25% higher (~$4.9B), partial GAAP leverage, and non-GAAP EPS growing ~30–40% to $0.35–0.40, driven by similar margin gains as in Q1.  Headcount and R&D invest will keep GAAP losses, but with break-even in sight by FY27 under our forecast.  

| **Company** | **Mkt Cap ($B)** | **1-Yr EPS Δ** | **FY P/E** | **Operating Margin** | **Analyst Rating** |
|------------|------------------:|---------------:|-----------:|--------------------:|-------------------|
| Snowflake (SNOW) | 73.0 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SNOW/snowflake/price-book#:~:text=Sector%20%20,The%20Company%20develops%20database)) | NM (loss) | NM | ~9% (non-GAAP) ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=,9)) | BUY (Argus) |
| Datadog (DDOG) | 51.7 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DDOG/datadog/price-book#:~:text=Sector%20%20,analytics%20platform%20for%20developers%2C%20IT)) | ~+25% | ~75× | ~20% (non-GAAP) | HOLD |
| Palantir (PLTR) | 260.0 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/dd4e334a-adf3-4626-9397-91832affd13a#:~:text=En%202025%2C%20Palantir%20ha%20tomado,Aunque%20su%20misi%C3%B3n)) | ~+150% | ~1,300× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PLTR/palantir-tech/pe-ratio#:~:text=ratio%20is%20a%20simple%20way,00)) | ~3% | HOLD |

*Snowflake’s valuation is high but reflects its premium growth.  It sits in the “high-growth, high-valuation” corner (long right axis, high price multiples).  Datadog has similar pull from growth but slightly lower valuation (av. P/S ~18–19×, table above).  Palantir currently trades at extreme multiple on speculative hopes (mostly due to 2025 stock surge ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/dd4e334a-adf3-4626-9397-91832affd13a#:~:text=En%202025%2C%20Palantir%20ha%20tomado,Aunque%20su%20misi%C3%B3n))) but its fundamentals (20–30% rev growth, mostly services) lag Snowflake.  On value vs. growth axes, Snowflake ranks as high-growth/important data platform, while peers like Datadog lean growth with narrower scope (IT monitoring) and Palantir is seen as more value/cyclical (huge valuation on modest profits).  The BUY rating reflects our view that Snowflake’s growth justifies its premium; the HOLD ratings on Datadog/Palantir reflect mixed near-term outlook and valuation concerns.*  

### Financial Strength & Dividend  
Snowflake’s balance sheet is solid.  **Cash & Inv.:** ~$3.9B (cash $2.24B + short-term invest $1.67B as of 4/30/25 ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,97%2C662))).  **Debt:** ~$2.3B zero-coupon convertible notes (net) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Common%20stock%3B%20%24%200,34)) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Convertible%20senior%20notes%2C%20net%20,61%2C264)); no other significant borrowings.  **Working Capital:** +$1.76B (current assets $4.786B vs current lib $3.031B ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Total%20current%20assets%20%20,359%2C439)) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Total%20current%20liabilities%20%20,15%2C501))), reflecting large unbilled contracts (deferred rev).  Net debt is modest (~$1.6B) relative to cash, implying net cash position.  Interest coverage is moot (0% coupons), but liquidity is ample (current ratio ~1.6).  **Payout:** Snowflake has never paid a cash dividend.  Any capital returned is via buyback: ~$0.5M shares bought in Q1 (trivial vs 333M float) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=match%20at%20L1886%20stock%20repurchases,the%20stockholders%E2%80%99%20equity%20on%20the)), with $4.0B+ remaining authorization ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=of%20directors%20authorized%20the%20repurchase,set%20trading)).  **Div. Growth:** N/A (no pays).  **Share Count:** Flat to down slightly (333.6M from ~334.3M year ago ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=Common%20stock%3B%20%24%200,34))) due to buybacks and withholding on equity settlements.  We expect modest share count reduction as the buyback program continues.  
**Rating Rationale:** We assign a *Medium-High* financial strength rating.  Large cash reserves and strong free cash flow (Q1 adj. FCF margin ~20% of rev ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=Free%20cash%20flow%20%20,20))) underpin liquidity, but the convertible notes (though zero-interest) add leverage and dilution risk.  The company’s cash/run-rate is sufficient to fund operations and buybacks.  Ongoing losses keep debt focus, but we view the balance sheet as conservative for this stage of growth.  

### Management & Risks  
• **Management:** Sridhar Ramaswamy (ex-Google Ads SVP) became CEO in early 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/snowflake-shares-sink-weak-forecast-surprise-ceo-retirement-2024-02-29/#:~:text=company%27s%20revenue%20projection%20conservative%20given,Despite%20the%20optimistic%20product)).  He succeeded Frank Slootman, aiming to leverage his AI and engineering background.  This is a recent regime change; investors will gauge his execution on longer sales cycles and product innovation.  The CFO role has also seen turnover (Julie Strauss ended 2024), now JV (justified by AI pay? but minor).  Transparency has improved: management now highlights product revenue and margins in each earnings release.  Snowflake has introduced policy climate guides (Non-GAAP reconciliation, etc) to align expectations.  We rate the team as competent and well-resourced, but relatively untested under this CEO.  
• **Risks:**  
  - **Competitive:** Snowflake faces intense competition from cloud incumbents (AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse, Google BigQuery), data-platforms (Databricks, Oracle), and emerging AI-data frameworks.  For example, a new startup Chalk touts real-time AI data computes versus Snowflake’s batch focus ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/databricks-competitor-chalk-raises-50-million-series-2025-05-28/#:~:text=placement,of%20the%20broader%20AI%20boom)).  Aggressive spending by hyperscalers on integrated analytics is a threat.  
  - **Macro:** Slowing IT budgets (tied to economy) could delay large deployments.  Valuation-driven market swings may impact growth stocks like Snowflake – a broad tech selloff could compress multiples even if fundamentals hold.  
  - **Regulatory/Data Privacy:** Snowflake must comply with evolving privacy laws (GDPR, EU AI Act, etc.) ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=%E2%80%A2new%2C%20evolving%2C%20and%20more%20stringent,use%20of%2C%20or%20access%20to)).  Any failure to secure customer data or adjust to localization could deter clients.  Heavy dependency on third-party cloud providers also exposes Snowflake to service availability and regulatory constraints.  
  - **Execution:** Rapid growth requires scaling sales/admin.  Staffing and integration of recent acquisitions (e.g. Streamlit, Mobius Data) pose execution risk.  If promotions or integrations falter, retention or usage could suffer.  
  - **Geopolitical:** Snowflake has limited direct footprint in China; expanding into China or other restricted markets could face regulatory hurdles or require foreign partners.  New Chinese cybersecurity regulations could hinder business ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-snowflake-inc-1640147-10q-2025-may-30-20238-8689#:~:text=match%20at%20L5432%20in%20China%2C,federal%20government)).  General US-China tensions and tech export rules could limit global expansion.  
  - **Financial:** As a growth company, Snowflake’s stock price is sensitive to any guidance cuts or above-guidance spending.  Share buyback plans could incur excise tax (per IRS rules), possibly altering capital allocation.  

### Company Description  
Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) is a cloud data platform provider.  Its flagship “Snowflake Data Cloud” (branded the AI Data Cloud) is a fully managed multi-cloud service for data warehousing, data lakes, data sharing, and real-time analytics ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=No,2026%2C%20ended%20April%2030%2C%202025)).  Snowflake’s platform runs on major public clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and enables customers to store and analyze large datasets with SQL and emerging AI tools.  Snowflake supports thousands of customers worldwide – including 754 of the Global 2000 ([www.snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2026/#:~:text=growth,Global%202000%20customers%2C%20representing%2027)) – across industries.  Products include core Snowflake (data storage/compute), Snowpark (developer platform), Marketplace (data/app exchange), and integrated AI/ML services.  The company is headquartered in Bozeman, Montana.  

### Valuation  
Our $230 target is based on a forward multiple framework.  We apply a ~16–17× multiple to our FY2026 product revenue forecast, slightly above Snowflake’s recent average (~14× ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SNOW/snowflake/price-sales#:~:text=2025,13.47))) to reflect improving growth and AI tailwinds.  This implies ~15× on total revenue vs. current ~14×.  By comparison, Datadog recently trades near 19× P/S ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DDOG/datadog/price-sales#:~:text=2025,12.82)), and older Snowflake troughs were in the mid-teens.  Our multiple matches Snowflake’s own long-term average and peer valuations given sustained 25%+ growth.  The target implies a premium to Snowflake’s past P/S (13.8× on Q1’26 data ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SNOW/snowflake/price-sales#:~:text=2025,13.47))) but is justified by catch-up to higher growth.  Downside risk on valuation is mitigated by our view that Snowflake still leads the underpenetrated cloud analytics market.  
**Rating Outlook:** Share price could overshoot our target if (positive skew) growth accelerates or margins expand faster than expected; conversely, a sustained growth slowdown or tech valuation contraction would test our BUY call.  We would review the rating if SNOW’s 2026 guidance is materially revised or if longer-term AI market adoption diverges from current trends.  

### Ratings Reference  
- **BUY:** Expected to outperform the broad market on a 12-month, risk-adjusted basis.  Typically implies >15% total return outlook vs. benchmark.  
- **HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with the market; risk/return neutral.  
- **SELL:** Expected to underperform; significant downside relative to market.  

**(Also indicated: 12-month rating / 5-year outlook; e.g., Buy / Positive; Sector Overweight.)**

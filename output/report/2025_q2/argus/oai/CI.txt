# Analyst’s Notes  
• **Steady Growth, Mixed Margin:** Q2’25 revenues rose ~11% Y/Y to $67.18B (reflecting broad-based billing growth) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=Shareholders%27%20net%20income%20for%20second,share%2C%20for%20second%20quarter%202024)), driving a ~7% increase in adjusted income from operations (ADOP) per share ($7.20 vs $6.72) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%247,1%2C2%7D%20of%20at%20least)). Traditional health plan insurance growth and specialty pharmacy strength (Evernorth) underpinned **revenue expansion**, though higher medical claims ratios (stop-loss, utilization) eroded some profit margins (Cigna Healthcare MCR ~83.2% in Q2’25 vs 82.3% a year ago ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=,49%20billion%20at%20June%2030))). Overall net income was flat at $5.71/share versus $5.45 (Q2’24) as rate increases roughly offset higher costs.  
• **Member Trends & Prior Sale:** Total customer relationships were ~182.2M at mid-2025, down from ~186.2M a year earlier ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=Total%20Customer%20Relationships,182%2C212)), largely due to closing the Medicare business sale (HCSC) in Mar ’25 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-2025-outlook-302444661.html#:~:text=The%20Cigna%20Group%20completed%20the,3)). Excluding that transaction, core membership held steady. Cigna’s risk-adjusted premiums benefited from pricing actions noted in Q1 (premiums +14% in Q1’25 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-2025-outlook-302444661.html#:~:text=,60%20per))) to cover expected medical cost inflation. First-half ADOP was $13.94/sh (vs $13.19) as improved cost controls (lower SG&A ratio 5.1% vs 6.1% ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=loss%20medical%20costs%20in%20Cigna,business%20mix%20shift%20and%20strong))) partly offset the costs.  
• **Business Unit Performance:** Evernorth Health Services (PBM & pharmacy) saw strong growth – Q2’25 adjusted revenues +17% Y/Y and pre-tax income +5% ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=,relative%20to%20second%20quarter%202024)) – driven by specialty drug volume and new client wins. Cigna Healthcare (insurance) saw shorter-term earnings pressure from stop-loss claims and residual MA business costs, but core segments (commercial and government plans excluding divested Medicare) are growing premiums.  
• **Capital Returns & Guidance:** Management reaffirmed 2025 ADOP outlook at ≥$29.60/share ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%247,1%2C2%7D%20of%20at%20least)) (vs prior $27.33 for FY24 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=,33%20per%20share))), which implies modest EPS growth. The Board increased the quarterly dividend 8% (to $1.51) and approved an extra $6.0B share buyback (total $10.3B authorization) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=,3%20billion)), reflecting strong cash flow. No further guidance changes.  
• **Ongoing Thesis:** We maintain that Cigna’s **diversified health portfolio** (insurance + services) should provide stable cash flow growth over time, but near-term earnings remain tied to volatile medical cost trends. The recent Medicare divestiture and favorable specialty pharmacy adoption are positives, while cost and regulatory uncertainties create offsetting risks. The stock is fairly valued; upside catalysts include stronger-than-expected margin improvement or new specialty wins, whereas a string of higher medical losses or adverse policy shifts could be headwinds.  

# Investment Thesis  
Cigna operates in secularly growing healthcare markets. U.S. national health expenditures continue to expand (~7% annual growth in 2025 ([www.fiercehealthcare.com](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/cms-study-healthcare-spending-likely-grow-71-2025#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20from%20federal,gross%20domestic%20product))), driven by aging demographics and higher drug/technology costs, which in turn support demand for insurance and care-management services. Cigna’s core franchise – private health insurance (Cigna Healthcare) – benefits from this trend via pricing power and an expanding client base of employers and governments. Its Evernorth services division (PBM, pharmacy distribution, care-services) capitalizes on the growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and integrated care solutions, where Cigna has won large contracts. The combined platform enables economies of scale and cross-sell (e.g. offering Cigna Healthcare plans alongside PBM).  

Profitability is moderate but cash-rich. The health insurance segment runs low single-digit operating margins (while generating float finance so-called “medical cost payable”), offset by higher-margin Evernorth services. Cigna historically converts earnings into free cash flow and returns capital aggressively to shareholders (as evidenced by recent ~$10B buyback authorization and rising dividend). 2020s healthcare reform seems to favor value-based care, and Cigna has invested in analytics and care management tools (via Evernorth and joint ventures) to improve its medical cost ratio (MCR). The risk-adjusted return profile is bolstered by a strong balance sheet (regulatory capital ratios well above requirements).  

Near-term catalysts: Consolidation in healthcare (if antitrust regimes loosen) could fuel deals; similarly, favorable PBM contracts or biosimilar drug adoption could boost Evernorth’s volume and margin. In addition, Cigna has lagged peers on cost trends, so any reversal of medical cost pressure (or successful price resets) should further expand adjusted margins.   

# Recent Developments  
• **Q1 2025 Results (Apr ’25):** Revenues +14% to $65.5B; shareholders’ net income $1.3B ($4.85/sh, vs $(0.97) loss a year ago) and ADOP $1.8B ($6.74/sh) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-2025-outlook-302444661.html#:~:text=,60%20per)). Guidance raised to ≥$29.60 ADOP/sh (from previous $27.50). IFRS divestiture of Medicare business to HCSC closed March 19, 2025 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-2025-outlook-302444661.html#:~:text=The%20Cigna%20Group%20completed%20the,3)).  
• **Q2 2025 Results (Jul ’25):** Revenues +11% Y/Y to $67.18B; shareholders’ net income ~$1.5B ($5.71/sh, 5% above prior year); ADOP $1.9B ($7.20/sh) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=Shareholders%27%20net%20income%20for%20second,share%2C%20for%20second%20quarter%202024)). Management reaffirmed 2025 ADOP outlook at ≥$29.60/sh (incorporating recent share repurchases) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%247,1%2C2%7D%20of%20at%20least)). Evernorth continued robust expansion, while Cigna Healthcare MCR rose ~90bps.  
• **Capital Actions:** At Feb ’25 board meeting (2024 results), dividend was increased 8% to $1.51/qtr and $6.0B added to buyback capacity (total $10.3B) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-establishes-2025-outlook-and-increases-dividend-302364341.html#:~:text=,3%20billion)). Q1 cash flow remained healthy to fund these returns.  
• **Regulatory/Competitive:** In Nov ’24, Fitch affirmed Cigna’s insurer IFS at A+ (subsidiaries) and holding co. IDR at BBB+ (stable outlook). (NAIC RBC ~264% at YE’23 ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Strong%20Risk,Fitch%20believes%20the)).) No material legal or antitrust developments; earlier industry M&A talk (e.g. with Humana) abated and Cigna is focused on organic growth.  
• **COVID/Pandemic Impact:** As of mid-2025, deferred-care cycles have largely normalized, but prior-year suppressed utilization has been a headwind on cost ratios through 2024 and early ’25 (stop-loss claims, etc.) ([www.fiercehealthcare.com](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/elevated-medical-costs-continued-drag-insurers-q1-2025-heres-look-how-major-payers-fared#:~:text=Cigna%20lands%20at%20No,sale%20of%20its%20MA%20plans)).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Cigna’s revenue growth is driven by insurance premium rate increases and membership gains in the U.S. healthcare segment, plus volume growth in Evernorth’s PBM and services. Health insurance revenue grows roughly with inflation plus membership changes: recent ~6–7% healthcare premium growth was reported, partly to offset medical cost inflation ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-first-quarter-2025-results-raises-2025-outlook-302444661.html#:~:text=quarter%202024%2C%20primarily%20reflecting%20premium,5)). Evernorth revenue can be more volatile, as it depends on drug price trends, formulary shifts and new client launches (Evernorth revenues grew ~17% in Q2’25 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=,relative%20to%20second%20quarter%202024))). High-margin specialty care and pharmacy services historically lift overall profit growth.  

Operating leverage is limited: higher utilization (medical claims) or stop-loss payouts can compress underwriting margins (MCR). Cigna has mitigated this via price management and digital health investments. SG&A is a smaller portion of revenues (~5–6%). EPS is impacted by investment income swings, tax rate (~13–15%), and foreign currency (modest). Share count is declining (~273M Q1’25 vs 283M in ’24 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CI/cigna-group/shares-outstanding#:~:text=,decline%20from%202021))) due to buybacks, boosting per-share metrics.  

**FY’25 Outlook:** The consensus ADOP ~\$29.6/sh (in line with company guidance). Our bridge expects revenue up mid-teens% (insurance premium growth +7%, Evernorth +12%), offset by stable-to-higher MCR (~~84% range) and SG&A ~5% of revenue. Tax rate ~13%. Assuming these, EPS (ADOP basis) flattens mid-single digits.

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Key peers (market cap, 1-yr EPS growth, FY P/E, operating margin, rating):  

| Company (Ticker) | Market Cap | 1-Yr EPS Growth | FY P/E | EBITDA Margin | Rating ) |
|------------------|-----------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|---------|
| UnitedHealth (UNH) | $236B    | ~+5% (’24E)      | ~11×  | ~8%            | BUY (AW) |
| Elevance Health (ELV, ex-ANTM) | $108B   | ~+4%           | ~10×  | ~5%          | HOLD    |
| Humana (HUM)     | $28B      | ~–5% (’24E)      | ~10×  | ~6%            | HOLD    |
| CVS Health (CVS, filtered PBM/insurance) | $150B | ~+5%            | ~11×  | ~6%   | HOLD    |

Cigna sits near the lower end of the valuation range, trading around 10× FY earnings (just below peers’ 10–12×) with comparatively lower profitability. On a growth/value axis, Cigna is more ‘value’ oriented (lower EPS growth, modest multiples) compared to UNH (higher multiple) and HUM (higher risk/regulatory exposure). Our HOLD rating reflects Cigna’s conservative positioning between growth and value: peers with stronger growth prospects trade at similar or higher multiples.  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Balance sheet is **strong** by insurance standards. Cigna held ~$7.5B cash and equivalents (end-2024) vs ~$37.8B long-term debt (mostly at the parent) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739940/000173994025000009/ci-20241231.htm#:~:text=Total%20revenues%20%20,)), for a net debt/EBITDA of roughly 1.5×. Regulatory capital (RBC) is high (est. ~264% at YE’23 ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Strong%20Risk,Fitch%20believes%20the))), and Fitch affirms Subsidiary IFS at A+ ([tools.morningstar.co.uk](https://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/stockreport/newsItem.aspx?id=TDJNDN_202411278908#:~:text=Fitch%20Ratings%20has%20affirmed%20the,IFS%29%20ratings)). Working capital swings are typical for insurers (reserves and receivables). The company targets “IG” credit metrics (currently BBB+ IDR).  

Dividend: current $6.04 holdup (=$1.51/qtr) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CI/cigna-group/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=Historical%20dividend%20payout%20and%20yield,07)), up 8% from 2023. Cigna plans gradual dividend growth, supported by ~20–40% payout ratio on adjusted EPS. Buybacks have been a larger capital return – $8B+ repurchased in 2023–24. Given cash flow (~$7–8B/yr) and large buyback authorization ($10.3B), share count should continue declining. Financial Strength Rating: **Medium** (ample capital but material debt and insurance liabilities).  

# Management & Risks  
CEO David Cordani (in role since 2008) and CFO Ann Dennison (joined early 2024 from Nasdaq) have deep industry and financial expertise ([www.thecignagroup.com](https://www.thecignagroup.com/our-leaders/leadership-team/ann-dennison#:~:text=Ann%20Dennison%20serves%20as%20Executive,led%20the%20corporate%20finance%20functions)). The company emphasizes disciplined underwriting and transparent guidance. Cigna has provided detailed outlook metrics (ADOP, MCR ranges, share count assumptions) and revised guidance promptly with results.  

Key risks include:  
- **Medical-cost inflation:** Sustained elevation in healthcare utilization and drug costs can raise Cigna’s loss ratio. Q1–Q2’25 saw higher MCR due to stop-loss claims and lagging MA funding ([www.fiercehealthcare.com](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/elevated-medical-costs-continued-drag-insurers-q1-2025-heres-look-how-major-payers-fared#:~:text=Cigna%20lands%20at%20No,sale%20of%20its%20MA%20plans)). Further spikes (e.g. due to epidemic or utilization swings) would pressure earnings.  
- **Regulatory:** Potential changes in US healthcare policy (drug pricing reforms, PBM regulations, Medicare rate cuts or expansion of coverage) could compress margins (especially in Evernorth’s PBM franchise) or increase compliance costs.  
- **Competition:** Major payers (UNH, Elevance, CVS/Aetna) and tech entrants intensify price competition. Consolidation (M&A) among smaller insurers could shift market share.  
- **Macroeconomic:** Economic downturns may not reduce enrollments (insurance is defensive), but could stress Medicaid funding or employer coverage trends. Interest-rate volatility affects returns on Cigna’s investment portfolio and financing costs (some debt is fixed).  
- **Legal & Compliance:** As a large insurer, Cigna faces litigation/regulatory scrutiny (trade practices, network adequacy, privacy) in multiple jurisdictions. Adverse rulings or fines (e.g. related to ERISA or out-of-network claims) could be a challenge.  

# Company Description  
The Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) is a global health services company offering insurance and health-related products. Through its **Cigna Healthcare** segment, it provides medical, dental, disability and life insurance and related services to individuals and employers across the U.S. and internationally. Its **Evernorth Health Services** segment (including PBM, care management and specialty pharmacy) delivers care delivery and cost-management services. Cigna maintains distribution in 30+ countries and serves roughly 180 million customer relationships worldwide ([newsroom.thecignagroup.com](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/2025-06-25-The-Cigna-Groups-Second-Quarter-2025-Earnings-Release-Details#:~:text=The%20Cigna%20Group%20,com)). Major products include commercial health plans, government-sponsored plans, pharmacy benefits (Express Scripts), and specialized care management services. The company’s focus is on integrated health solutions and cost-effective care delivery across its diversified portfolio.  

# Valuation  
Our target price is derived from a multiples-based approach. We apply ~12× our FY2025 ADOP/share estimate (~$29.6) to arrive at ~$355–360, roughly in line with Cigna’s historical P/E and modestly above its current multiple. This compares to peer multiples: UNH/Elevance trade around 10–12×, while Humana is ~10× ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cigna-group-reports-strong-second-quarter-2025-results-reaffirms-2025-adjusted-eps-outlook-302517853.html#:~:text=billion%2C%20or%20%247,1%2C2%7D%20of%20at%20least)) (FY24 figures). If Cigna’s normalized earnings growth (from rate actions and specialty trends) modestly outpaces consensus, a premium multiple is justified; conversely, any deterioration in loss trends or regulatory pressures would argue for a valuation nearer the low end of its trading range. We see roughly equal upside/downside risk relative to our $360 target. Outperformance would require (for example) sustained MCR improvement or unexpected large wins in Evernorth, whereas a downgrade would be triggered by persistent medical-cost overruns or adverse regulatory changes.  

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** We strongly believe the stock will outperform relevant market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months.  
**HOLD:** We expect roughly in-line performance with market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted 12-month view.  
**SELL:** We believe the stock will underperform relative to market benchmarks over the next 12 months.

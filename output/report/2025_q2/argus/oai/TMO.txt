Organic growth in R&D & bioprocess offset by lower services/test sales. Adjusted EPS $5.15 (+1%) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,to%20%245.15)); GAAP EPS $3.98 (+15%). Adjusted operating margin ~21.9% (down 10bp).  Free cash flow remained robust (~$2B qtr).  
• **Growth drivers:** Life-science consumables and lab services remain steady cotracting with a pause in vaccine research. Instrument sales (particularly MS/SEM) and diagnostics saw modest growth. Government/academic spending weighed on demand.  
• **Guidance raise:** FY2025 outlook updated: revenue $43.3–44.2B (+1–3% organic) and adj. EPS $21.76–22.84 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=of%20the%20impact%20of%20the,While%20the)). Guidance reflects ~$1.0 EPS drag from new U.S. tariffs and policy (∼$0.70 + $0.30) ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=Adjusted%20EPS%20is%20%241%20lower,our%20mitigation%20actions%20are%20realized)), offset by cost actions. Implied operating margin ~22.3%.  
• **Capital deployment:** Announced $4.1B deal for Solventum purification/filtration unit ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)). Q1 buybacks $2.0B; raised quarterly dividend 10% ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)).  Balance sheet remains strong (cash ~$4B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,5%2C088)), debt ~$48B; net debt ~46B).  
• **Outlook:** Management cites leverage of its PPI operating system and broad pipeline.  Near‐term catalysts include integrations (Olink proteomics, Sorbentum filtration) and easing of funding headwinds. Prospects hinge on macro resilience; downside limited by robust base business and cash returns.  

# Investment Thesis  
Thermo Fisher commands a leadership position at the nexus of life-science research, diagnostics and biomanufacturing (FY2024 revenue ~$42.9B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,to%20%2421.86))).  Its end markets – broad R&D, biotech/pharma, environmental/industrial testing, and clinical diagnostics – are large and growing. For example, the global bioprocessing market (critical to biologic drug production) is projected to roughly double to ~$53B by 2030 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/bioprocess-technology-market-size-to-hit-usd-53-30-bn-by-2030#:~:text=According%20to%20Nova%20one%20advisor%2C,from%202022%20to%202030)).  Thermo Fisher’s diversified segments (Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, Lab Products & Biopharma Services ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Life%20Sciences%20Solutions%20%20,))) capture this secular growth.  The consumables and lab products businesses (~55% of sales) generate recurring revenue; higher-margin segments (e.g. protein analysis and diagnostics) contribute outsized profits. The firm’s *PPI* continuous-improvement system supports operating margins (adj. op margin ~22% ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Adjusted%20EPS%20in%20the%20first,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202024))) and yields strong free cash flow (~17% of sales guidance for FY25 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=match%20at%20L524%20prior%20guide,of%20capital%20deployment%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20assuming))).  

Thermo Fisher is a cash-rich, free-cash-flow machine. It generated ~$7–7.4B FCF in 2025 guidance ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=match%20at%20L524%20prior%20guide,of%20capital%20deployment%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20assuming)), funding a shareholder-friendly policy: in 2024–25 it deployed ~$5B to buybacks including $2B in Q1 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)) ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Completes-1B-Share-Repurchase/default.aspx#:~:text=WALTHAM%2C%20Mass.,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20share%20repurchase%20authorization)), while raising the dividend ~10%/yr ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=repurchased%20%242,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)). The balance sheet is solid (debt/equity ~1.0 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TMO/thermo-fisher-scientific/debt-equity-ratio#:~:text=Date%20%20,1.11))), and the upcoming Sorbentum and Olink deals target high-value niches (filtration and proteomics). Catalysts include post-covid normalization of research spending, ramp-up of new products (e.g. next-gen centrifuges and instruments) and cost synergies from acquisitions. The stock offers a growth profile midway between high-PE lab peers and more mature healthcare stocks.

Signed a bioimaging R&D alliance with Chan Zuckerberg Institute (Mid-May).  

# Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue growth is driven by diversified end markets. In FY2024 sales (≈$42.9B) were flat ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,to%20%2421.86)) (–1% organic) as strong industrial/diagnostic demand offset softer academic/government budgets. In FY2023 revenue was $42.9B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results/#:~:text=,55)) (–5% YoY, organic +1%), and FY2022 was $44.9B ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230131005797/en/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022-Results#:~:text=,24)) (+15%). We forecast low-single-digit top-line growth in 2025 (midpoint of guidance). Key drivers: stable growth in bioprocess and consumables, moderate growth in analytical instruments; legacy COVID-related testing has nearly vanished (only ~$50M in Q4’23 ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results/#:~:text=,55))). Pricing and volume both contribute, with occasional FX drags.  

Operating leverage is substantial but partly offset by cost pressures. Adjusted operating margin was ~23–24% in 2024 ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,to%20%2421.86)), but guidance for 2025 implies ~22.3%. Q1’25 adj. op margin dipped to 21.9% ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=Non)) on mix and investments. Assuming mid-point growth, our FY2025 adj. EPS estimate is ~$22.3. This is only ~2% above FY2024 ($21.86 ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,to%20%2421.86))) due to the ~$1.0 tariff/policy drag and modest leverage. The EPS bridge from FY2024 to FY2025 is as follows: ~$+0.9 from organic growth and cost actions, ~$–1.0 from macro headwinds ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=Adjusted%20EPS%20is%20%241%20lower,our%20mitigation%20actions%20are%20realized)), yielding net ~$+0.4 (≈+2%).

# Peer & Industry Analysis  
Peers include instrumentation and lab-service firms. Danaher (DHR) leads industrial/life-science tools; Agilent (A) focuses on analytical instruments; Becton Dickinson (BDX) on medical/diagnostic tools. Danaher (Mkt Cap ≈$200B) delivered ~10% EPS growth last year; trades ~30–35× 2025E EPS ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DHR/danaher/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,35.94)). Agilent (≈$45B) has ~5–10% growth, trading ~26× (Apr ’25) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/A/agilent-technologies/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,29.30)). BDX (~$60B) has ~flat EPS growth, ~40× P/E ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BDX/becton-dickinson/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,46.27)). Thermo Fisher’s 12-mo forward P/E (~25×) sits between Agilent and Danaher. Its adjusted EBIT margin (~22%) is roughly in line with peers. We assign all a neutral/HOLD rating. In a Growth vs. Value framework, Thermo Fisher leans toward growth (higher R&D/Rx exposure) but at a valuation below Danaher’s premium multiple ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DHR/danaher/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,35.94)) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TMO/TMO/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,37.13)).

*Thermo Fisher trades at a moderate premium to Agilent (flat-growth instrumentation co.) yet a discount to higher-growth diversified peers (Danaher) while delivering more predictable cash flow. Compared with peers, TMO is in the mid-quadrant of Growth vs. Value.*  

# Financial Strength & Dividend  
Thermo Fisher’s balance sheet is healthy. As of Q4’24, cash + short‐term investments totaled ~$5.6B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=Cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents%20,5%2C088)) against long-term debt ~$48B (net debt ~$42B); equity ~$50B, implying Debt/Equity ~0.96 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TMO/thermo-fisher-scientific/debt-equity-ratio#:~:text=2025,1.11)). Working capital is solid (positive current assets ~22.1B vs. liabilities ~14B). The company targets strong liquidity to fund acquisitions and buybacks, and FCF provides ample cover. We rate the balance sheet Medium-High given the manageable leverage and stable liquidity.  

The dividend has grown steadily (~10% raises per year ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010))) – Q1’25 DPS $0.106 (annualized ~$0.425) up from $0.085 in Q1’24 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=repurchased%20%242,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010)). The current payout ratio is moderate (<15% on adjusted EPS). Coupled with heavy buybacks (~$3.5B in 2024  and $2.0B Q1’25 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-reports-first-quarter-2025-results#:~:text=,increased%20our%20dividend%20by%2010))), the share count is trending down. We expect continued share repurchases given the corporate commitment; dividend yield remains low (~0.4%) but growing.  

# Management & Risks  
CEO **Marc Casper** (Chairman, CEO since 2009) provides long-tenured stability. CFO **Steve Williamson** (onboard since 2011) announced a 2026 retirement (succession planned) ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientifics-Chief-Financial-Officer-Stephen-Williamson-to-Retire-in-Early-2026/default.aspx#:~:text=Thermo%20Fisher%20Scientific%E2%80%99s%20Chief%20Financial,to%20Retire%20in%20Early%202026)). Senior management is experienced and the PPI framework is well-entrenched; guidance is relatively transparent.  

**Key Risks:**  
• **Macroeconomic & Policy:** Slowing research and healthcare budgets (academic, government, vaccine trials) can blunt demand ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=Rafael%20Tejada%2C%20Vice%20President%2C%20Investor,cover%20our%20Safe%20Harbor%20statement)). Recent U.S.-China tariff increases and domestic funding policies are expected to cut ~$1.00 EPS in FY25 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=Adjusted%20EPS%20is%20%241%20lower,our%20mitigation%20actions%20are%20realized)); further escalations would pose upside cost.  
• **Competitive Pressure:** Intense competition in life-science tools and outsourcing services could lead to pricing pressure. Disruption in bioprocess supply chains or faster tech transitions (e.g. new sequencing methods) may affect market share.  
• **M&A/Integration:** Large acquisitions carry execution risk. The pending $4.1B filtration business deal and other tuck-ins (e.g. last year’s Olink proteomics) are not included in guidance ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-thermo-fisher-q1-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3669848#:~:text=match%20at%20L533%20And%20our,Q1%20and%20adjusted%20EPS%20in)); any delays or integration costs could impact financials.  
• **Regulatory/Litigation:** As a global supplier, Thermo Fisher faces complex regulatory compliance (e.g. export controls, clinical trial regulations). Material litigation—while historically limited—could emerge.  
• **Currency & Inflation:** Though partially hedged, adverse FX moves (strong USD) and rising input costs could erode margins.

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is the world’s leading life-sciences tools and lab solutions company (FY2024 sales ~$42.9B ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/#:~:text=,to%20%2421.86))).  Headquartered in Waltham, MA, it serves biotech, pharma, institutions, hospitals and industry. Its major business lines are **Life Sciences Solutions** (reagents, consumables and instruments for R&D), **Analytical Instruments** (mass spectrometers, chromatography and environmental analysis systems), **Specialty Diagnostics** (diagnostic test kits and instruments), and **Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services** (bioproduction ingredients, lab consumables and custom drug development/clinical labs) ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2025/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Life%20Sciences%20Solutions%20%20,)). Thermo Fisher’s mission is to enable customers “to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer,” leveraged through a broad technology portfolio and 40,000+ global employees ([ir.thermofisher.com](https://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-events/news/news-details/2024/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Completes-1B-Share-Repurchase/default.aspx#:~:text=annual%20revenue%20of%20approximately%20%2440,laboratories%2C%20improving%20patient%20health%20through)).  

# Valuation  
We derive our 12-month target via a P/E multiple approach.  Thermo Fisher’s 2025E EPS (~$22.3) using mid-point guidance and adjusting for buybacks implies a target around $600 (≈27× EPS).  This multiple is in line with peer averages ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/company-news/thermo-fisher-stock-remains-a-buy-as-analyst-adjusts-2025-eps-estimates-raises-price-target-93CH-1538872#:~:text=The%20new%20price%20target%20is,during%20the%20upcoming%20Investor%20Day)) (Danaher/Agilent medians) and slightly below Thermo Fisher’s own historical trading range (~30–35× prior years ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TMO/TMO/pe-ratio#:~:text=2025,37.13))).  The target ~27× represents ~10% below peak post-COVID valuations.  Our target assumes sustained organic growth (~2% in 2025) and operating leverage improvements; it implies modest appreciation from current levels.  If Thermo Fisher can >+5% grow EPS (e.g. via cost cuts or stronger end-markets), a higher multiple (~30×) would be justified. Conversely, a persistent downturn or higher costs could force a valuation re-rate lower.  

*Rating Upside/Downside:* Upside catalysts include better-than-expected recovery in R&D spending, faster integration of acquisitions (boosting medium-term growth), and continued margin expansion. Conversely, further macro weakness (slower biopharma/cancer drug investment, new tariff costs) or valuation compression (if industry multiples contract) would pressure the stock. A move well above 30× 2025 EPS (~$680+) would require exceptionally strong outperformance, while a drop below 20× (~$360) would justify a downgrade.     

# Ratings Reference  
**BUY:** Expected to outperform the broad market (e.g. S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
**HOLD:** Expected to deliver roughly in line with the broad market (±10%) over 12 months.  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform the broad market significantly over the next 12 months.  

*Long-Term View:* BUY suggests superior 5-year growth relative to peers; SELL suggests material deterioration. Our Sector stance is market-weight in Life Sciences (Neutral relative to general Healthcare).

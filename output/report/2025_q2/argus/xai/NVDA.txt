### Analyst’s Notes
• Nvidia reported record Q1 FY2026 revenue of $44.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and 69% year-over-year, driven primarily by data center segment strength amid surging AI compute demand [1].  
• Data center revenue reached $39.1 billion, reflecting 73% year-over-year growth, with contributions from Hopper GPUs and emerging Blackwell platform ramp-up [6].  
• Adjusted EPS came in at $0.81, exceeding estimates of $0.76, supported by gross margins of 61% despite supply chain pressures [7].  
• Gaming revenue hit $3.8 billion, up 48% year-over-year, bolstered by AI-enhanced graphics and professional visualization tools [6].  
• Company announced $14 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, underscoring strong free cash flow generation and commitment to capital returns [6].  
• Guidance for Q2 FY2026 projects revenue around $47 billion, implying continued acceleration in AI infrastructure spending, though cross-border trade risks persist [1].

### Investment Thesis
Nvidia maintains leadership in accelerated computing, capitalizing on secular AI adoption across data centers, cloud providers, and enterprise. The addressable market for AI chips is projected to exceed $100 billion annually by 2025, with Nvidia capturing over 80% share in high-performance GPUs via its CUDA ecosystem and full-stack offerings [8]. Key product pillars include data center platforms like Hopper and Blackwell, which enable efficient training and inference for large language models, alongside growth in automotive (e.g., DRIVE platform) and gaming (RTX series).

Margin expansion remains robust, with operating leverage from scale yielding adjusted gross margins above 60%, supporting free cash flow conversion over 90% of net income [1]. Nvidia's capital allocation prioritizes buybacks ($14 billion in Q1 FY2026) and modest dividends, enhancing EPS growth [6]. Near-term catalysts include Blackwell production ramp and partnerships with hyperscalers, potentially driving 50%+ revenue growth in FY2026, though moderated by macroeconomic headwinds.

### Recent Developments
• On May 28, 2025, Nvidia released Q1 FY2026 earnings, reporting $44.1 billion in revenue (up 69% YoY) and $0.81 adjusted EPS, with data center contributing 89% of total [1].  
• Guidance for Q2 FY2026 revenue was set at approximately $47 billion, reflecting optimism on AI demand but noting potential supply constraints [1].  
• The company authorized an additional $50 billion for share repurchases, following $14 billion executed in Q1, signaling confidence in cash flow outlook [6].  
• No major M&A announced in the period, though ongoing investments in AI startups and ecosystem partners were highlighted in the earnings call [1].  
• Regulatory scrutiny on AI chip exports to certain markets continued, with no material changes reported [9].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue growth is propelled by data center volume, where processed transactions for AI workloads have surged, offset partially by customer incentives. Cross-border revenue contributes ~20% of total, vulnerable to trade policies. Operating leverage is evident in margin expansion, with Q1 FY2026 opex growth at 15% versus 69% revenue growth, driving EPS upside [1]. For FY2025, EPS growth bridged from volume (+60 points), mix (+10 points), net of incentives (-5 points).

| Fiscal Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Data Center ($B) | Adjusted EPS ($) |
|----------------|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|
| Q1 FY2025     | 26.0        | 262             | 22.6            | 6.12             |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include AMD (market cap ~$250B, 1-yr EPS growth 40%, current FY P/E 45x, op. margin 25%, rating: BUY), Intel (market cap ~$100B, 1-yr EPS growth -10%, current FY P/E 30x, op. margin 10%, rating: HOLD), and TSMC (market cap ~$800B, 1-yr EPS growth 20%, current FY P/E 25x, op. margin 40%, rating: BUY). Nvidia leads on growth metrics, trading at a premium due to AI dominance.

| Company | Market Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E | Op. Margin (%) |
|---------|----------------:|---------------------:|:--------------:|---------------:|
| NVDA   | Assumption: 2,700 | 50                   | 55.0          | 60             |
| AMD    | 250             | 40                   | 45.0          | 25             |
| INTC   | 100             | -10                  | 30.0          | 10             |
| TSM    | 800             | 20                   | 25.0          | 40             |

Nvidia sits firmly on the growth axis, with valuations reflecting superior revenue acceleration versus value-oriented peers like Intel, amid industry shift to AI semiconductors.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Nvidia holds substantial cash reserves exceeding $30 billion and positive working capital, with debt-to-equity below 0.3x, enabling flexibility for investments and returns [1]. Payout policy focuses on buybacks over dividends, with $14 billion repurchased in Q1 FY2026, reducing shares by ~2% [6]. Dividend remains modest at $0.01 per share post-split, with no significant growth signaled [10]. Share count is expected to trend lower via ongoing repurchases. Financial Strength Rating: High, justified by strong liquidity and low leverage supporting AI capex.

### Management & Risks
CEO Jensen Huang (tenure since 1993) and CFO Colette Kress (since 2013) provide consistent transparency through detailed guidance on platform ramps and market demand.  
• Regulatory risks from U.S. export controls on AI chips to China, potentially impacting 10-15% of data center revenue [9].  
• Macroeconomic slowdown could reduce enterprise IT spending, pressuring growth rates [11].  
• Competitive threats from AMD and custom ASICs by hyperscalers, eroding market share in inference workloads [8].  
• Geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, affecting supply chain for key foundry partner TSMC [12].  
• Supply constraints on advanced nodes may delay Blackwell rollout, as noted in earnings [1].

### Company Description
Nvidia Corporation designs and markets graphics processing units (GPUs) and system-on-chip units for computing, gaming, data centers, professional visualization, and automotive applications. Its global footprint spans over 50 countries, with key brands including GeForce for gaming, Quadro for visualization, and A100/H100 for data centers. The company emphasizes AI and machine learning through its CUDA software platform, serving cloud providers, enterprises, and autonomous vehicle developers.

### Valuation
Target price of $140 derived from 50x multiple on FY2026 EPS estimate of $2.80, a premium to historical 40x average but aligned with peer AMD at 45x amid AI growth [13]. This implies 27% upside from assumed current price, with downside skew limited by recurring software/services revenue. Rating would shift to HOLD if data center growth decelerates below 50% YoY.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-Month Rating: BUY; Five-Year Stance: Positive; Sector Stance: Over-Weight.

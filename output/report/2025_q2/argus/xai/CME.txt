### Analyst’s Notes  
• CME Group's Q1 2025 revenue reached a record $1.6B, up 10% YoY, driven by broad-based average daily volume (ADV) of 29.8M contracts across asset classes [2].  
• Interest rate products saw 15% ADV growth to 15.2M contracts, fueled by U.S. Treasury and SOFR futures amid rate uncertainty [2].  
• Equity index volumes rose 8% to 7.1M contracts, with energy and metals up 12% combined, reflecting hedging demand [2].  
• Adjusted operating income hit $1.0B, up 12% YoY, with margins expanding to 65% on cost discipline and scale [2].  
• Guidance for FY25 expense growth at 5-7% reaffirmed, supporting EPS growth projections of 8-10% [2].  
• Thesis update: Reinforcing BUY on secular tailwinds in derivatives trading; monitoring cross-border volume trends for Q2 catalysts [3].  

### Investment Thesis  
CME Group benefits from secular drivers including rising market volatility, institutional demand for risk management, and global expansion of derivatives usage. The company's addressable market exceeds $10T in notional value across interest rates, equities, FX, commodities, and emerging crypto products, with product pillars like SOFR and E-mini futures capturing over 50% of volumes [2][5]. Monetization vectors include transaction fees (70% of revenue), clearing services, and value-added data/analytics, supporting consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth.  

Margins remain robust at 60%+, generating strong free cash flow (FCF) of ~$3B annually for dividends and buybacks; the firm returned $1.6B to shareholders in 2024 via dividends [5]. Near-term catalysts include potential Fed rate cuts boosting volumes and expansion into new flows like spot crypto benchmarks, enhancing network effects [3]. Overall, CME's oligopolistic position in cleared derivatives positions it for 8-10% EPS CAGR through 2027, justifying premium valuation.  

### Recent Developments  
• On April 23, 2025, CME reported Q1 2025 results with record revenue of $1.6B (up 10% YoY) and ADV of 29.8M contracts (up 11%), led by interest rates and commodities [2].  
• Management reaffirmed FY25 expense guidance of $1.65B-$1.70B, implying 5-7% growth, with no changes to capital return plans [2].  
• In February 2025, CEO Terry Duffy outlined 2025 goals focusing on record 2024 growth continuation, including tech investments and product launches [3].  
• No major M&A announced; ongoing integration of prior acquisitions like NEX Group continues to drive clearing efficiencies [5].  
• Regulatory updates: Continued compliance with CFTC rules on derivatives clearing; no new material legal items reported [0].  
• Capital returns: Quarterly dividend maintained at $1.15 per share for Q1 2025, with annual variable dividend policy intact [2].  

### Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue drivers include transaction volumes (ADV), cross-border activity (20% of volumes), and processed transactions via clearing (up 10% YoY in Q1 2025) [2]. Client incentives average 15% of revenues but support volume retention; operating leverage from fixed costs yields margin expansion on 10%+ volume growth. For FY25, EPS bridge assumes 8% revenue growth, 200bps margin uplift, and $0.50/share from buybacks, targeting $9.80-$10.00 EPS.  

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | ADV (M) | Op. Margin (%) | EPS ($) |  
|-------------|--------------|---------|----------------|---------|  
| 2022       | 5.0         | 23.5   | 62.0          | 7.40   |  
| 2023       | 5.6         | 25.3   | 63.5          | 8.90   |  
| 2024       | 5.8         | 27.0   | 64.0          | 9.50   |  
| Q1 2025    | 1.6         | 29.8   | 65.0          | 2.50   |  

### Peer & Industry Analysis  
Peers include Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, $140B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 12%, FY P/E 24x, op. margin 55%, Rating: BUY), Nasdaq (NDAQ, $35B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 5%, FY P/E 20x, op. margin 30%, Rating: HOLD), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE, $20B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 10%, FY P/E 22x, op. margin 40%, Rating: BUY), and Deutsche Boerse (DB1 GY, $40B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 8%, FY P/E 18x, op. margin 50%, Rating: HOLD). CME sits in the growth quadrant with superior margins and EPS momentum versus value-oriented peers like Nasdaq, benefiting from diversified volumes.  

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr. (%) | FY P/E (x) | Op. Margin (%) |  
|------|--------------|------------------|------------|----------------|  
| ICE | 140.0       | 12.0            | 24.0      | 55.0          |  
| NDAQ| 35.0        | 5.0             | 20.0      | 30.0          |  
| CBOE| 20.0        | 10.0            | 22.0      | 40.0          |

### Financial Strength & Dividend  
Balance sheet shows $3.0B cash, positive working capital of $2.5B, and low debt/equity of 0.1x as of Q1 2025 [2]. Payout policy targets 50% of earnings via regular dividends plus annual variable based on FCF; buybacks averaged $500M annually. Dividend grew 10% YoY in 2024 to $4.60 ttm [5]. Share count flat at 360M, with modest dilution risk. Financial Strength Rating High due to investment-grade credit, recurring revenues, and minimal leverage.  

### Management & Risks  
CEO Terry Duffy (tenure since 2016) and CFO Julie Holzrichter provide consistent transparency via quarterly calls and guidance [2][3].  
• Regulatory: Potential CFTC rule changes on clearing could increase costs (5-10% expense impact) [0].  
• Macro: Economic slowdown may reduce trading volumes by 10-15% [5].  
• Competitive: Rivals like ICE eroding share in rates/equities; crypto entrants challenging new flows [3].  
• Geopolitical: Trade tensions affecting commodity/FX volumes, as seen in 2024 cross-border dips [2].  
• Cyber: Data breach risks in high-volume exchange operations [0].  

### Company Description  
CME Group operates the world's largest derivatives exchanges, offering futures, options, and clearing services across interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural products, metals, and select crypto benchmarks. With a global footprint spanning the U.S., Europe, and Asia, its brands include CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX, processing over 20B contracts annually for institutional and retail clients [0][1].  

### Valuation  
Target price of $240 derived from 24x FY26 EPS of $10.00, a 10% premium to 5-year average P/E of 22x, reflecting peer multiples (ICE at 24x) and growth outlook [4][5]. Implies 17% upside from current levels; DCF sensitivity yields similar $235-$245 range assuming 8% perpetual growth. Upside skew positive on volume beats; downgrade to HOLD if margins contract below 60%.  

### Ratings Reference  
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (+/-10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive; Sector stance: Market-Weight.

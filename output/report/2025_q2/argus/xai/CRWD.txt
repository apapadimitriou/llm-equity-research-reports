### Analyst’s Notes
• CrowdStrike reported Q1 FY26 revenue of $1.1B, up 25% YoY, driven by 23% ARR growth to $4.4B and $194M in net new ARR [2]. 
• Non-GAAP EPS reached $0.73, beating estimates by $0.07, with operating margin expanding to 28% on disciplined cost control [2].
• Falcon Flex deals surged, with total deal value exceeding $3.2B, up over 6x YoY, highlighting multi-module adoption [2].
• Guidance for Q2 FY26 includes revenue of $1.15B and EPS of $0.83, both above consensus, while FY26 revenue guide of $4.78B implies 21% growth [2,5].
• Cross-module penetration remains strong, with 64% of customers using 5+ modules, supporting durable revenue streams amid macro headwinds [2].
• Free cash flow hit a record $279M, up 39% YoY, underscoring cash generation strength despite competitive pressures [2].

### Investment Thesis
CrowdStrike benefits from secular tailwinds in cybersecurity, including escalating threats from nation-state actors and AI-driven attacks, with the global market projected to grow at 12-15% annually through 2030 [7]. The company's Falcon platform, leveraging AI and cloud-native architecture, addresses endpoint, cloud, and identity protection, capturing share in a $100B+ addressable market [2]. Monetization vectors include subscription-based new flows, value-added services like threat intelligence, and partnerships expanding into SIEM and ITDR, driving high-teen revenue CAGR.

Margin profile is robust, with non-GAAP gross margins at 80% and operating leverage from scale, targeting 30%+ FCF margins long-term [2,6]. Capital returns focus on share buybacks, with $300M repurchased in FY25, reducing shares by ~2% annually, though no dividend is paid [6]. Near-term catalysts include Falcon Flex momentum and acquisitions like Flow Security, enhancing data protection amid regulatory scrutiny [4].

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-06-03, CrowdStrike released Q1 FY26 results: revenue $1.1B (+25% YoY), ARR $4.4B (+23% YoY), net new ARR $194M, and record FCF $279M; guidance slightly missed FY26 revenue estimates but beat on EPS [2].
• In Q4 FY25 (reported 2025-03-04), revenue reached $1.1B (+25% YoY), ARR $4.24B (+23% YoY), non-GAAP EPS $1.03; announced acquisition of Flow Security to bolster cloud data security [1,6].
• No major regulatory or legal updates pre-cutoff; ongoing antitrust scrutiny in tech sector noted, but no CrowdStrike-specific actions [Assumption: Based on general industry trends].
• Capital returns: Authorized $500M buyback program extension in FY25, with $224M net new ARR addition signaling growth continuity [6].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue growth is propelled by subscription volume (up 25% YoY in Q1 FY26), multi-module adoption, and cross-border expansion, with incentives stable at 12-15% of revenue to drive retention [2]. Operating leverage stems from 80% gross margins and controlled opex growth (up 18% YoY), yielding EPS upside via scale [2,6]. For FY25, EPS bridged from $3.20 prior to $4.10 on revenue beats and margin gains [6].

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | YoY % | ARR ($B) | Net New ARR ($M) | Non-GAAP EPS | FCF ($M) |
|-------------|--------------|-------|----------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| FY23       |    2.2      |  54.0|    2.6  |              760|         1.50|      941|
| FY24       |    3.1      |  36.0|    3.4  |              850|         2.50|     1160|
| FY25       |    3.8      |  25.0|    4.2  |              900|         4.10|     1300|
| Q1 FY26    |    1.1      |  25.0|    4.4  |              194|         0.73|      279|

(Data from company filings; FY25 includes Q4 results [6]; Q1 FY26 [2].)

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Palo Alto Networks (PANW, $145B mkt cap, 15% 1-yr EPS growth, 45x FY P/E, 25% op. margin, BUY), Fortinet (FTNT, $45B mkt cap, 12% growth, 32x P/E, 28% margin, HOLD), Zscaler (ZS, $30B mkt cap, 30% growth, 120x P/E, 18% margin, BUY), Check Point (CHKP, $20B mkt cap, 5% growth, 22x P/E, 35% margin, HOLD). CrowdStrike positions as a growth leader with superior ARR expansion, trading at a premium on P/E but justified by 20%+ margins and AI differentiation versus value-oriented peers like CHKP.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr% | FY P/E | Op Margin % | Rating |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| PANW|        145.0|         15.0|   45.0|        25.0|    BUY|
| FTNT|         45.0|         12.0|   32.0|        28.0|   HOLD|
| ZS  |         30.0|         30.0|  120.0|        18.0|    BUY|
| CHKP|         20.0|          5.0|   22.0|        35.0|   HOLD|
| CRWD|         85.0|         25.0|   89.0|        28.0|    BUY|

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows $3.8B cash, positive working capital of $1.2B, and low debt/equity of 0.4x, supporting acquisitions and buybacks [2,6]. No dividend paid, with focus on growth reinvestment; buyback cadence averaged $250M/quarter in FY25 [6]. Share count trended down 1.5% YoY [6]. Financial Strength Rating: Medium-High, due to strong cash flow ($1.3B FCF FY25) and liquidity offsetting high R&D spend [6].

### Management & Risks
CEO George Kurtz (tenure since 2011) and CFO Burt Podbere provide consistent guidance, with high transparency on ARR metrics [2,6]. No recent tenure changes pre-cutoff.

• Regulatory risks: Potential antitrust probes in cybersecurity consolidation, as seen in broader tech sector [Assumption: Industry-wide].
• Macro risks: Economic slowdown could pressure IT budgets, impacting net new ARR (e.g., +6% Q/Q in Q4 FY25) [6].
• Competitive risks: Intensifying rivalry from PANW and MSFT, potentially eroding market share in endpoint security [7].
• Geopolitical risks: Cyber threats from state actors may boost demand but disrupt operations in key regions [7].
• Incident risks: Software update issues could lead to customer churn, though none material pre-cutoff [4].

### Company Description
CrowdStrike Holdings provides cloud-delivered cybersecurity solutions via its Falcon platform, encompassing endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cloud workload security. Operating globally with a presence in over 170 countries, the company serves enterprises through subscription models, leveraging AI for real-time threat detection across its network of brands and partnerships.

### Valuation
Target price of $420 derived from 85x FY26 non-GAAP EPS of $4.90 (implying 20% growth), a premium to 5-year historical average of 70x but aligned with peers like ZS at 120x on superior ARR momentum [2,5]. Compares to PANW at 45x, reflecting CrowdStrike's growth tilt. Upside skew positive on beat-and-raise potential; downgrade to HOLD if ARR growth dips below 20%.

### Ratings Reference
**BUY**: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
**HOLD**: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
**SELL**: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-Month Rating: BUY. Five-Year Stance: Positive (long-term growth bias). Sector Stance: Over-Weight.

### Analyst’s Notes
• BlackRock reported Q1 2025 EPS of $10.78, missing consensus expectations of $12.05, driven by lower-than-anticipated performance fees amid market volatility [1].  
• Assets under management (AUM) reached $10.5 trillion as of Q1 end, up 12% YoY, supported by equity market gains and net inflows of $76 billion, particularly in ETFs [1].  
• Revenue grew 8% YoY to $4.7 billion in Q1, with investment advisory fees contributing 80% of total, though cross-border flows slowed due to geopolitical tensions [1].  
• Operating margin expanded to 36.5% in Q1 from 35.2% prior year, reflecting cost discipline and scale benefits from Aladdin platform enhancements [3].  
• Management reiterated FY2025 guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth, but flagged potential headwinds from interest rate uncertainty; no changes to dividend or buyback plans [1].  
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on resilient fee-based model and private markets expansion, despite near-term EPS miss; expect Q2 inflows to accelerate with stabilizing markets [3].

### Investment Thesis
BlackRock benefits from secular tailwinds in passive investing and alternatives, with its iShares ETF franchise capturing 40% of global ETF market share, driving consistent fee revenue [4]. The company's diversification into private markets, including infrastructure via recent acquisitions, positions it to tap a $15 trillion addressable market by 2030, enhancing margin profiles through higher-fee products [6]. Strong free cash flow generation, averaging $4.5 billion annually over the past three years, supports robust capital returns, including a 2.5% dividend yield and $1.5 billion in annual buybacks, reducing shares outstanding by 1-2% per year [4].

Near-term catalysts include potential Fed rate cuts boosting equity inflows and Aladdin platform growth, which serves over 200 clients and generates recurring tech revenue [3]. Monetization vectors span consumer wealth (via model portfolios), institutional flows (pensions and sovereigns), and value-added services like risk analytics, with cross-selling opportunities amplifying organic growth to 5-7% annually [6]. Overall, BLK's scale and tech edge warrant a premium to peers, with upside from market recovery outweighing macro risks.

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-04-11, BlackRock released Q1 2025 earnings, reporting revenue of $4.7 billion (up 8% YoY) and EPS of $10.78 (below $12.05 consensus), with AUM at $10.5 trillion [1].  
• Management provided FY2025 guidance for revenue growth of 6-8% and EPS of $40-42, citing strong ETF inflows but cautioning on performance fee volatility [1].  
• In Q4 2024, BlackRock completed acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding $100 billion in AUM and bolstering private markets capabilities [6].  
• No major regulatory updates; ongoing SEC scrutiny of ESG disclosures noted in 2024 filings, with no material impact [4].  
• Capital returns: Declared quarterly dividend of $5.10 per share in Q1 2025, up 2% YoY; repurchased $375 million in shares during the quarter [1].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
BlackRock's revenue is driven by AUM levels (80% from advisory fees), with YoY growth tied to market appreciation, net inflows, and transaction volumes. Incentives, including client rebates, averaged 15% of fees in recent years, pressuring margins but offset by operating leverage from fixed costs. Cross-border AUM contributes 25% of total, sensitive to FX and trade dynamics. For FY2025, EPS bridge assumes 7% revenue growth, 100bps margin expansion, and $1.5 billion buybacks, yielding ~10% EPS increase despite Q1 miss.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | EPS ($) | AUM ($T) | Op. Margin (%) |
|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| 2022       | 17.9        | 30.2   | 8.6     | 35.8          |
| 2023       | 17.9        | 36.5   | 10.0    | 36.2          |
| 2024       | 18.7        | 39.8   | 10.0    | 36.0          |
| Q1 2025    | 4.7         | 10.8   | 10.5    | 36.5          |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include State Street (STT, $30B mkt cap, 8% 1-yr EPS growth, 15.2x P/E, 28% op. margin, HOLD), T. Rowe Price (TROW, $25B mkt cap, 5% growth, 14.5x P/E, 32% margin, HOLD), Invesco (IVZ, $10B mkt cap, 3% growth, 12.8x P/E, 25% margin, SELL), and Vanguard (private, est. $8T AUM). BlackRock leads on scale and growth, positioned as a growth-oriented player with superior margins versus value peers like IVZ.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | Curr FY P/E | Op. Margin (%) | Rating |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| BLK  | 120.5       | 9.0           | 20.5       | 36.5          | BUY   |
| STT  | 30.0        | 8.0           | 15.2       | 28.0          | HOLD  |
| TROW | 25.0        | 5.0           | 14.5       | 32.0          | HOLD  |
| IVZ  | 10.0        | 3.0           | 12.8       | 25.0          | SELL  |

BLK sits on the growth axis with higher multiples reflecting ETF dominance, contrasting value peers' lower growth but cheaper valuations.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
BlackRock holds $9.8 billion in cash and equivalents, with working capital of $5.2 billion and debt/equity of 0.25x as of Q1 2025 end, supporting a High Financial Strength Rating due to low leverage and strong liquidity [1,4]. Payout policy targets 75% of earnings via dividends (yield 2.5%) and buybacks, with dividends growing 10% CAGR over five years [4]. Buyback cadence averaged $1.5 billion annually; expect 1% share reduction in FY2025 based on guidance [1]. No material debt maturities until 2027.

### Management & Risks
CEO Laurence Fink (tenure since 1988) and CFO Martin Small (since 2023) maintain transparent guidance, with quarterly calls emphasizing AUM trends and tech investments [1,4].  
• Regulatory: Increased SEC oversight on crypto and ESG products could raise compliance costs [4].  
• Macro: Interest rate hikes may reduce equity AUM and inflows, as seen in 2022 downturn [6].  
• Competitive: Rivalry from low-cost providers like Vanguard pressures fee rates [3].  
• Geopolitical: Trade tensions impact cross-border AUM, contributing 25% of total [1].  
• Cybersecurity: Dependence on Aladdin exposes risks to data breaches [4].

### Company Description
BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, operating a global network with $10.5 trillion in AUM across equities, fixed income, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies [1]. Its core brands include iShares ETFs and the Aladdin technology platform, serving institutional and retail clients in over 30 countries with products spanning index funds, active management, and wealth advisory services [4].

### Valuation
Target price of $950 derived from 22x forward P/E multiple applied to FY2026 EPS estimate of $43.20, a premium to historical 18-20x average and peer group (15-18x for STT/TROW), justified by 10% AUM growth and alternatives expansion [3]. Compares to current 20.5x; implies 17% upside from last close. Upside skew from market rally; downgrade to HOLD if AUM growth falls below 5%. (Assumption: FY2026 EPS based on trend extrapolation, as post-cutoff forecasts unavailable.)

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive (long-term growth bias); Sector stance: Market-Weight.

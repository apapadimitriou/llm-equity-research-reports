### Analyst’s Notes  
• AMD reported Q1 2025 revenue of $7.44B, up 36% YoY, beating estimates of $7.11B, driven by data center segment growth of 57% YoY to $3.7B from EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs [1][2].  
• Non-GAAP EPS for Q1 2025 reached $0.96, exceeding expectations of $0.95, with gross margin expanding to 54% from 52% YoY, reflecting improved operating leverage [1][3].  
• Q2 2025 guidance issued in May projects revenue of approximately $7.4B, implying flat sequential performance but above consensus of $7.2B, with continued AI accelerator momentum cited by management [2][4].  
• Data center revenue is expected to remain a key driver in Q2, supported by hyperscaler demand for MI300 series GPUs, though client and gaming segments face mixed headwinds from inventory normalization [1][5].  
• Operating expenses rose 10% YoY in Q1 to $1.8B, but efficiency gains supported a 10-point operating margin expansion to 11%, positioning for potential EPS upside if Q2 volumes align with guidance [3].  
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on secular AI tailwinds, though near-term volatility possible pending Q2 results (not yet released as of report date); monitor cross-segment processed transactions and cross-border chip flows amid regulatory scrutiny [5].  

### Investment Thesis  
Advanced Micro Devices benefits from secular drivers in AI and high-performance computing, with its data center segment poised for sustained growth amid expanding demand for accelerators and processors. The company's Instinct MI300 GPUs and EPYC CPUs address a total addressable market projected to exceed $400B by 2027 in AI infrastructure, supported by partnerships with major cloud providers [5]. Margin profiles are improving, with non-GAAP gross margins above 50% enabling stronger free cash flow generation, projected at $2.5B for FY25 based on guidance, facilitating potential buybacks and R&D investments [1].  

Key product pillars include consumer payments via embedded solutions, new flows in edge computing, and value-added services like software ecosystems, monetized through volume-based pricing and subscription models. Near-term catalysts include Q2 earnings validation of AI ramp-up and potential M&A in silicon design, though execution risks remain in competitive GPU landscapes [4]. Overall, AMD's positioning supports 20-25% annual revenue growth through 2026, with dividends absent but share repurchases averaging $1B quarterly in recent periods [3].  

### Recent Developments  
• On May 6, 2025, AMD released Q1 2025 earnings, reporting revenue of $7.44B (up 36% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, with data center revenue surging 57% to $3.7B [1].  
• Management provided Q2 2025 revenue guidance of $7.4B, citing strong AI business acceleration and positioning for second-half growth, though no changes to full-year outlook were specified [2].  
• No major M&A announced in Q1 2025, but ongoing integration of prior acquisitions like Xilinx continues to bolster embedded and adaptive computing revenues [3].  
• Regulatory items include U.S. export controls on advanced chips to certain regions, with no material Q1 impact reported, though cross-border volumes monitored [5].  
• Capital returns: AMD repurchased $500M in shares during Q1 2025, consistent with its policy of returning excess cash; no dividends paid [1].  

### Earnings & Growth Analysis  
Revenue drivers for AMD include processed transaction volumes in data center (up 57% YoY in Q1 2025), cross-border shipments of GPUs, and incentives from volume rebates to partners. Operating leverage is evident in margin expansion, with Q1 gross margin at 54% benefiting from mix shift to high-margin AI products. For FY25, EPS growth is bridged by 30%+ revenue increase, offset by 10% expense growth, yielding projected non-GAAP EPS of $4.00 (assumption based on guidance trends). Cross-border dynamics remain positive but sensitive to trade policies.  

| Fiscal Period | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Non-GAAP EPS ($) | Gross Margin (%) |  
|---------------|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|  
| FY22         |         23.6 |            21.0 |             3.50 |             45.0 |  
| FY23         |         22.7 |            -4.0 |             2.90 |             46.0 |  
| FY24         |         22.7 |             0.0 |             2.65 |             47.0 |  
| Q1 FY25      |          7.4 |            36.0 |             0.96 |             54.0 |

### Peer & Industry Analysis  
Peers include NVIDIA (NVDA, market cap $2.5T, 1-yr EPS growth 150%, current FY P/E 60x, gross margin 75%, rating BUY), Intel (INTC, market cap $100B, 1-yr EPS growth -10%, current FY P/E 25x, gross margin 40%, rating HOLD), and Qualcomm (QCOM, market cap $200B, 1-yr EPS growth 15%, current FY P/E 20x, gross margin 55%, rating BUY). AMD sits in the growth quadrant, with higher P/E reflecting AI upside versus value-oriented peers like INTC, though its margins lag NVDA due to scale differences. Industry tailwinds from semiconductors favor over-weight stance.  

| Peer | Market Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E (x) | Gross Margin (%) |  
|------|----------------:|---------------------:|-------------------:|-----------------:|  
| NVDA |          2500.0 |               150.0 |               60.0 |             75.0 |  
| INTC |           100.0 |               -10.0 |               25.0 |             40.0 |  
| QCOM |           200.0 |                15.0 |               20.0 |             55.0 |  
| AMD  |           260.0 |                40.0 |               45.0 |             54.0 |  

Valuations as of pre-2025-07-07 data [3][4].  

### Financial Strength & Dividend  
AMD maintains a strong balance sheet with $6.0B in cash and equivalents, positive working capital of $10B, and debt-to-equity ratio of 0.1x as of Q1 2025 [3]. No dividend is paid, focusing instead on buybacks, with $500M repurchased in Q1 and average quarterly cadence of $400-600M. Financial Strength Rating of High is justified by low leverage, consistent FCF (Q1 at $1.2B), and liquidity supporting R&D in AI. Share count has trended flat, with buybacks offsetting dilution; no dividend growth applicable [1].  

### Management & Risks  
CEO Dr. Lisa Su has led since 2014, with CFO Jean Hu in role since 2023; transparency is high via detailed guidance and quarterly calls.  
• Regulatory risks: U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors could impact 10-15% of cross-border revenue [5].  
• Macro risks: Economic slowdowns may reduce enterprise spending, pressuring client segment volumes (down 5% QoQ in Q1) [1].  
• Competitive risks: Intensified rivalry from NVDA in GPUs could erode market share, with AMD's Instinct line holding ~10% of AI accelerator market [4].  
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions in Asia, where 80% of manufacturing occurs, pose volatility to processed transactions [3].  
• Execution risks: Delays in MI300X ramp-up might miss Q2 guidance, affecting EPS by 5-10% [2].  

### Company Description  
Advanced Micro Devices designs and manufactures high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies, operating a global network with brands like Ryzen, Radeon, and EPYC. Its footprint spans over 50 countries, with products encompassing CPUs, GPUs, and embedded solutions for data centers, PCs, gaming, and automotive applications.  

### Valuation  
Target price of $200 derived from P/E multiple of 50x applied to FY26 EPS estimate of $4.00 (DCF cross-check yields similar), comparing to peer average of 35x and AMD's 5-year historical median of 40x [4][5]. This implies 25% upside from assumed last close, with positive skew from AI catalysts; downside limited to 10% on margin compression. Rating would shift to HOLD if Q2 revenue misses guidance by >5%.  

### Ratings Reference  
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive long-term bias; Sector stance: Over-Weight.

### Analyst’s Notes
• Adobe reported Q2 FY25 revenue of $5.87B, up 11% y/y, driven by Digital Media segment growth of 12% to $4.31B, with Creative Cloud ARR increasing 10% to $13.8B[1].  
• Total RPO rose 10% y/y to $19.7B, indicating solid bookings pipeline, while Digital Media ARR reached $18.1B, up 12% y/y[2].  
• Non-GAAP EPS hit $5.06, beating expectations by $0.09, supported by operating margin expansion to 47.2% from cost efficiencies in AI tools[1].  
• Company raised FY25 revenue guidance to ~$23.55B (up $100M) and EPS to ~$20.00, reflecting confidence in AI monetization across Firefly and Acrobat[1].  
• Document Cloud revenue grew 19% y/y to $825M, fueled by AI features in PDF processing, with cross-sell contributing 15% of segment growth[1].  
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on accelerating AI adoption; near-term catalysts include Express mobile app traction and enterprise AI deals.

### Investment Thesis
Adobe benefits from secular tailwinds in digital content creation and marketing automation, with AI integrations like Firefly enhancing product stickiness. The addressable market for creative software is projected at $205B by 2025, where Adobe holds ~60% share in professional tools[3]. Key pillars include Creative Cloud (60% of revenue), Document Cloud (15%), and Experience Cloud (25%), monetized via subscriptions yielding 90% recurring revenue. Margin profile remains strong at 45% non-GAAP operating, with FCF generation of $7.2B in FY24 supporting $5B in buybacks[4].

Near-term catalysts include AI-driven upsell in enterprise segments, targeting 15% y/y Digital Media growth. Capital returns focus on share repurchases, reducing outstanding shares by 2% annually, enhancing EPS. Risks are mitigated by diversified revenue, but thesis hinges on sustained 10-12% top-line growth amid economic stability.

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-06-12, Adobe released Q2 FY25 earnings with revenue of $5.87B (up 11% y/y) and non-GAAP EPS of $5.06 (up 13% y/y), exceeding consensus; raised FY25 revenue outlook to $23.50-23.60B[1].  
• Guidance update: Q3 FY25 revenue projected at $5.90-5.95B, with non-GAAP EPS $4.90-4.95, reflecting AI momentum[1].  
• In Q1 FY25 (reported 2025-03-12), revenue grew 10% to $5.7B, with Digital Media ARR up 13%[5].  
• No major M&A announced; prior Figma deal termination in 2023 avoided regulatory hurdles, freeing $1B termination fee for reinvestment[6].  
• Regulatory: EU scrutiny on AI data practices ongoing, but no material impacts as of Q2 reporting[7].  
• Capital returns: Repurchased 4.6M shares in Q2 FY25 for $2.5B, with $25B authorization remaining[1].

• Macro: Economic slowdown may reduce enterprise spend, impacting 25% of revenue[1].  
• Competitive: Rise of open-source AI tools like Stable Diffusion erodes Creative Cloud share[10].  
• Geopolitical: Supply chain disruptions in Asia affect hardware partnerships, though minimal direct exposure[4].  
• Currency: 40% international revenue exposes to FX volatility, with 2% Q2 headwind[1].

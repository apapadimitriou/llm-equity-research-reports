### Analyst’s Notes
• UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2025 revenues reached $99.8B, up 8.6% YoY, driven by Optum segment growth of 11.9% to $59.3B, though UnitedHealthcare revenues grew only 6.4% to $75.4B amid Medicare Advantage pressures [1].
• Adjusted EPS for Q1 2025 was $6.91, missing consensus estimates of $7.05, marking the first miss since 2008, attributed to elevated medical loss ratio of 84.3%, up 310 bps YoY due to cyberattack impacts and utilization trends [2].
• Cross-border and value-added services showed resilience, with Optum Health serving 103M consumers, up 1M YoY, and Optum Rx scripts processed at 380M, up 7% YoY [1].
• Full-year 2025 guidance revised downward, with adjusted EPS now $27.50–$28.00 from prior $27.50–$28.15, reflecting ongoing medical cost headwinds and a $0.85–$0.95 EPS impact from a February 2025 cyberattack on Change Healthcare [1].
• Operating margins compressed to 8.1% in Q1, down from 8.7% YoY, but cash flows from operations were strong at $6.8B, 1.1x net income, supporting capital deployment [1].
• Thesis update: Maintain HOLD as near-term catalysts like Optum's tech-enabled services offset risks, but monitor Q2 utilization for potential rebound; assumption of mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q2 based on Q1 trends.

### Investment Thesis
UnitedHealth Group benefits from secular drivers in U.S. healthcare, including aging populations and rising demand for managed care, with an addressable market exceeding $4T in health expenditures [3]. The company's dual-platform model—UnitedHealthcare for insurance and Optum for health services—positions it to capture growth in consumer payments, new care flows, and value-added services like data analytics and pharmacy benefits. Monetization vectors include expanding Optum's tech platforms, which processed over 1.5T transactions annually as of 2024, driving cross-sell opportunities and margin expansion through operating leverage [4].

Margin profile remains robust with 2024 adjusted operating margin of 8.5%, supported by scale efficiencies, though near-term pressures from medical costs could limit FCF conversion to 90–95% of earnings [4]. Capital returns are strong, with $8B in 2024 share buybacks and a 15% dividend increase to $8.36 annually, yielding 2.2% at current levels [4]. Near-term catalysts include recovery from the Change Healthcare cyberattack and potential M&A in value-based care, potentially adding 2–3% to EPS growth.

Overall, UNH's diversified revenues (55% from Optum in Q1 2025) provide resilience against regulatory headwinds in Medicare Advantage, supporting mid-teens EPS growth over the long term despite current valuation compression [1].

### Recent Developments
• On April 17, 2025, UnitedHealth Group reported Q1 2025 earnings with revenues of $99.8B (+8.6% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $6.91, missing estimates due to higher medical costs; full-year adjusted EPS guidance lowered to $27.50–$28.00 [1].
• The company revised 2025 outlook to account for a $0.85–$0.95 EPS hit from a February 2025 cyberattack on its Change Healthcare unit, disrupting claims processing [1].
• In January 2025, UnitedHealth announced 2024 full-year results with revenues of $371.6B (+14.6% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $25.12, reflecting strong growth across segments [4].
• No major M&A announced pre-May 2025 cutoff; ongoing integration of prior acquisitions like LHC Group continues to bolster home health services [4].
• Regulatory scrutiny on Medicare Advantage persists, with CMS finalizing 2025 payment rates implying a 0.16% effective cut, impacting UNH's premium growth [5].
• Capital returns updated in Q1 2025 with $2.1B in share repurchases and dividends paid, maintaining a $25B buyback authorization [1].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include premium growth in UnitedHealthcare (80% of 2024 revenues) tied to membership volume, up 2% YoY to 29M in Medicare in Q1 2025, and transaction-based fees in Optum, bolstered by cross-border services and processed claims [1]. Incentives like rebates reduced net revenues by 1–2% historically, but operating leverage from scale supports margin recovery. EPS bridge for FY25 assumes 10% revenue growth offset by 2–3% margin compression from medical costs, yielding mid-single-digit EPS expansion [Assumption: Based on revised guidance trends].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Adj. EPS ($) | Operating Margin (%) | Medical Loss Ratio (%) |
|--------------|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------------:|------------------------:|
| FY2022      |        324.2 |            12.7 |        22.19 |                   8.4 |                    82.2 |
| FY2023      |        324.1 |            -0.0 |        21.86 |                   8.2 |                    83.2 |
| FY2024      |        371.6 |            14.6 |        25.12 |                   8.5 |                    83.4 |
| Q1 2025     |         99.8 |             8.6 |         6.91 |                   8.1 |                    84.3 |

Data sourced from company reports; FY2023 revenue flat due to segment shifts [4].

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Humana (HUM, market cap $42B, 1-yr EPS growth -5%, current FY P/E 12.5x, op. margin 4.2%, our rating HOLD), CVS Health (CVS, $72B, -2%, 10.8x, 3.8%, HOLD), Cigna (CI, $95B, 8%, 14.2x, 4.5%, BUY), Elevance Health (ELV, $120B, 6%, 15.1x, 5.0%, BUY), and Centene (CNC, $38B, 4%, 11.0x, 3.2%, HOLD). UNH leads on scale and margins but trades at a premium P/E reflecting growth; it sits toward the Growth axis versus Value peers like CVS, with superior EPS momentum.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | Curr FY P/E (x) | Op Margin (%) |
|------|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|---------------:|
| HUM  |          42 |              -5 |             12.5 |            4.2 |
| CVS  |          72 |              -2 |             10.8 |            3.8 |
| CI   |          95 |               8 |             14.2 |            4.5 |
| ELV  |         120 |               6 |             15.1 |            5.0 |
| CNC  |          38 |               4 |             11.0 |            3.2 |
| UNH  |         318 |              10 |             18.2 |            8.5 |

Assumption: Peer data approximated from pre-2025-05-15 analyst estimates; UNH's higher multiples justified by diversified model.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows $28.8B cash and short-term investments as of Q1 2025 end, with working capital of $15.2B and debt-to-equity of 0.7x, reflecting low leverage [1]. Payout policy targets 25–30% of earnings for dividends, with 2024 yield at 2.2% and 15% CAGR growth over five years [4]. Buybacks averaged $7–8B annually, reducing shares by 2% YoY; expect continued repurchase cadence of $5–7B in 2025 per authorization [1]. Financial Strength Rating High, justified by $29B operating cash flow in 2024 (1.2x net income) and investment-grade ratings [4]. Dividend growth likely 10–15% annually if EPS trends hold; share count expected to decline 1–2% YoY.

### Management & Risks
CEO Andrew Witty (tenure since 2021) and CFO John Rex provide consistent transparency via quarterly calls, with guidance typically conservative; no major changes pre-2025-05-15 [1].
• Regulatory risks: CMS Medicare Advantage rate cuts could reduce premiums by 1–2% in 2025, pressuring margins [5].
• Macro risks: Rising medical utilization and inflation may elevate MLR above 83%, as seen in Q1 2025's 84.3% [1].
• Competitive risks: Peers like Humana expanding in value-based care could erode UNH's 30% market share in Medicare [3].
• Geopolitical/cyber risks: February 2025 Change Healthcare attack disrupted operations, costing $0.85–$0.95 EPS; ongoing threats persist [1].
• Assumption: Additional risks like antitrust scrutiny on Optum acquisitions, based on industry trends [No direct source pre-cutoff].

### Company Description
UnitedHealth Group operates a diversified healthcare enterprise through UnitedHealthcare, providing insurance benefits to over 50M members across employer, individual, Medicare, and Medicaid segments, and Optum, which delivers health services including pharmacy benefits (Optum Rx), clinical care (Optum Health), and tech-enabled insights (Optum Insight). With a global footprint in 150+ countries and brands like UnitedHealthcare and Optum, the company focuses on integrated care models, processing billions of transactions annually to improve outcomes and affordability.

### Valuation
Target price of $380 derived from blended multiples approach: 16x FY25 EPS estimate of $27.75 (midpoint of guidance), comparable to five-year historical average P/E of 17x and peer median of 13x (e.g., Elevance at 15x) [3]. DCF sensitivity implies similar value assuming 9% WACC and 4% terminal growth, reflecting UNH's premium to peers on superior margins. Target multiple implies 10% upside from last close, with balanced skew; rating would upgrade to BUY on MLR stabilization below 83% or downgrade to SELL on further guidance cuts.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: HOLD; Five-year stance: Positive (long-term growth bias); Sector stance: Market-Weight.

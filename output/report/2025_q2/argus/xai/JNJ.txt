### Analyst’s Notes (250 words)
• Q1 2025 reported sales rose 2.4% to $21.9B, with operational growth of 4.2% and adjusted operational growth of 3.3%, driven by strong performance in Innovative Medicine segment [1].  
• Adjusted EPS increased 2.2% to $2.77, including reversal of special charges; reported EPS jumped to $4.54, reflecting improved margins despite tariff and acquisition impacts [1].  
• Company raised full-year 2025 operational sales guidance to account for CAPLYTA addition post-Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition, though foreign exchange and tariffs temper overall outlook [1].  
• Pipeline highlights include TREMFYA approval for Crohn’s disease, positive RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE data in lung cancer, and icotrokinra progress in psoriasis, bolstering growth prospects [1].  
• Operational sales excluding COVID-19 vaccine effects showed strength at 7.0% for 2024 full-year, setting a positive tone for Q2 amid ongoing innovation [2].  
• Expect Q2 to benefit from new product launches and acquisition integration, with revenue growth projected in mid-single digits operationally, though macro headwinds like currency fluctuations persist [1].

### Investment Thesis
Johnson & Johnson benefits from secular drivers in healthcare, including aging populations and demand for innovative therapies, with a diversified portfolio across Innovative Medicine, MedTech, and consumer health. The company's addressable market exceeds $1T globally, supported by product pillars like oncology (e.g., DARZALEX), immunology (e.g., TREMFYA), and surgical devices. Monetization vectors include new drug approvals, label expansions, and value-added services such as digital health integrations, driving sustained revenue [1][3].

Margin profile remains strong with adjusted operational growth outpacing reported figures, generating robust free cash flow (FCF) of approximately $18B in 2024 [2]. Capital returns are shareholder-friendly, featuring consistent dividend increases (63rd consecutive year in 2024) and share buybacks totaling $6.4B in 2024 [2]. Near-term catalysts include pipeline milestones and acquisition synergies from Intra-Cellular, potentially adding 1-2% to sales growth in 2025 [1].

Overall, JNJ's defensive positioning and innovation edge support premium valuation amid economic uncertainty.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows cash of $26B, working capital $15B, and debt/equity of 0.4 as of Q1 2025, supporting high liquidity [1][3]. Payout policy targets 50-60% of earnings, with dividends growing 5.6% annually over five years [2]. Buybacks averaged $5-7B yearly, reducing shares by 1-2% [2]. Financial Strength Rating: High, justified by low leverage and consistent FCF generation exceeding $15B annually [2]. Expected share-count trend: modest decline via buybacks, assuming stable capital allocation.

### Management & Risks
CEO Joaquin Duato (tenure since 2022) and CFO Joseph Wolk provide transparent guidance, with quarterly updates emphasizing pipeline and M&A [1][3].  
• Regulatory risks: Potential FDA delays on approvals, as seen in historical drug reviews [3].  
• Macro risks: Currency fluctuations impacted Q1 2025 growth by 1.8% [1].  
• Competitive risks: Biosimilar erosion for STELARA, projecting 10-15% sales decline in 2025 [1].  
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions from global tensions, affecting MedTech volumes [2].  
• Litigation risks: Ongoing talc claims, with reserves at $10B as of 2024 [2].  
• Acquisition risks: Integration challenges from Intra-Cellular deal, adding dilution [1].

### Company Description
Johnson & Johnson operates a global healthcare network with brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid, and pharmaceuticals such as DARZALEX and TREMFYA. Its footprint spans over 150 countries, focusing on Innovative Medicine (pharma), MedTech (devices), and consumer health products, delivering treatments for oncology, immunology, and surgical needs [3][6].

### Valuation
Target price of $185 derived from P/E multiple of 17.5x applied to FY26 EPS estimate of $10.60, compared to historical average of 16x and peer Merck at 18x [5]. This implies 10% upside from current levels, with comps based on Q1 2025 multiples [1]. Upside skew from pipeline successes; downside if litigation escalates. Rating would shift to HOLD on sustained EPS misses below 2% growth.

### Ratings Reference
**BUY:** Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive (innovation-driven); Sector stance: Market-Weight.

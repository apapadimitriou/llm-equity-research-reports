### Analyst’s Notes
• Synopsys reported Q2 FY2025 revenue of $1.60B, up 10% YoY, driven by robust demand in AI and IP segments, though partially offset by macroeconomic challenges in China [1]; this exceeded expectations at the midpoint of guidance.

• Operating income reached $400M, reflecting 25% margins, with adjusted EPS of $2.50, missing consensus by 5% due to higher R&D expenses amid integration efforts post-Ansys merger [2].

• Backlog grew to $7.2B, up 15% YoY, underscoring strong multi-year contracts in EDA and IP, with AI-related bookings contributing 30% of new deals [1].

• Guidance for Q3 FY2025 projects revenue of $1.55B-$1.60B, implying 8-10% growth, while full-year FY2025 revenue outlook was raised to $6.5B, up 12% YoY, supported by value-added services and cross-selling opportunities [2].

• The Ansys merger, completed in July 2025, enhances Synopsys' simulation capabilities, expected to add $200M in synergies by FY2026, though integration risks remain a near-term watch item [3].

• Thesis update: Maintain BUY as AI tailwinds outweigh China headwinds; expect margin expansion to 28% in FY2026 from operating leverage, with FCF projected at $1.8B [1].

### Investment Thesis
Synopsys benefits from secular drivers in AI, hyperscale computing, and chip design complexity, with the global EDA market projected to grow at 10% CAGR through 2028 [4]. The company's core EDA tools, IP portfolios, and emerging multi-physics simulation (post-Ansys) address an addressable market exceeding $50B, fueled by demand for advanced nodes in semiconductors. Monetization vectors include software subscriptions (70% of revenue), value-added services like prototyping, and new flows in AI-optimized design, which drove 15% YoY growth in IP revenue in Q2 FY2025 [1].

Margin profile remains strong at 25-28%, with operating leverage from scalable software models supporting robust FCF generation of $1.5B annually [1]. Capital returns focus on buybacks, with $500M repurchased in FY2024, reducing shares by 2% YoY; no dividend is paid, prioritizing reinvestment in R&D [5]. Near-term catalysts include Ansys integration synergies and potential regulatory easing in China, positioning SNPS for 12-15% EPS growth through FY2027.

### Recent Developments
• Synopsys reported Q2 FY2025 results on May 22, 2025, with revenue of $1.60B (up 10% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $2.50, driven by AI demand but impacted by China restrictions [1].
• Full-year FY2025 guidance raised to $6.5B revenue (up 12% YoY) and $10.50 adjusted EPS, reflecting confidence in backlog and IP momentum [2].
• Completed acquisition of Ansys on July 17, 2025, enhancing simulation offerings; post-merger Form 3 filing disclosed new director holdings of 2,074 shares [3].
• No major regulatory updates, but ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions noted as a risk in Q2 earnings call [2].
• Authorized $1B share repurchase program extension in Q1 FY2025, with $200M executed YTD [5].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include EDA software volume (60% of mix), IP licensing, and cross-border deals, with incentives tied to multi-year contracts averaging 3-5 years. Q2 FY2025 saw 10% revenue growth from transaction volume, though cross-border revenue dipped 5% due to China exposure [1]. Operating leverage improved margins by 200bps YoY via cost controls, while EPS bridge for FY2025 includes $0.50 from Ansys accretion offset by $0.30 integration costs [2]. Growth outlook hinges on 12% backlog expansion, with FCF conversion at 90% of net income.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Adj. EPS ($) | Operating Margin (%) | Latest Qtr (Q2 FY25) |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| FY2022     | 5.08        | 12.0          | 7.50        | 24.0                | -                   |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Cadence Design Systems (CDNS, $70B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 12%, curr FY P/E 48x, op margin 30%, our rating BUY), Siemens Digital Industries (private, est $50B rev, growth 8%, margin 25%), and ANSYS (recently acquired, pre-merger P/E 45x). Synopsys sits on the growth axis with superior AI exposure but trades at a premium to value-oriented peers like Keysight (KEYS, $25B mkt cap, growth 5%, P/E 20x, margin 22%, rating HOLD).

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | Curr FY P/E | Op Margin (%) | Rating |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| CDNS | 70.0        | 12.0          | 48.0       | 30.0         | BUY   |
| KEYS | 25.0        | 5.0           | 20.0       | 22.0         | HOLD  |
| SNPS | 84.2        | 14.0          | 55.0       | 26.0         | BUY   |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Synopsys maintains a solid balance sheet with $1.5B cash, positive working capital of $2.0B, and low debt/equity of 0.1x as of Q2 FY2025 [1]. No dividend is paid, with capital allocation emphasizing buybacks ($500M in FY2024) and M&A [5]. Share count declined 1.5% YoY from repurchases. Financial Strength Rating High, justified by 90% FCF conversion, minimal leverage, and recurring revenue model supporting resilience. Expected share-count trend: 1-2% annual reduction via buybacks, assuming steady FCF.

### Management & Risks
CEO Sassine Ghazi assumed role in January 2024, with prior COO experience; CFO Shelagh Glaser has 5+ years tenure, providing continuity in guidance transparency [6].
• Regulatory risks from U.S.-China trade restrictions, impacting 15% of revenue [2].
• Macroeconomic slowdown in semiconductors, potentially reducing EDA spending by 5-10% [4].
• Competitive pressures from Cadence and open-source tools, eroding market share in IP [7].
• Geopolitical tensions, including supply chain disruptions in Asia [2].
• Integration risks from Ansys merger, with potential $100M in unforeseen costs [3].

### Company Description
Synopsys provides electronic design automation (EDA) software, intellectual property (IP), and services for semiconductor design and manufacturing, operating a global network across 80+ countries. Key brands include Design Compiler, Verdi, and post-Ansys, simulation tools like HFSS; product scope spans chip verification, prototyping, and AI-optimized flows for consumer electronics, automotive, and data centers.

### Valuation
Target price of $650 derived from 50x forward P/E multiple applied to FY2026 EPS estimate of $13.00, a premium to 5-year historical average of 45x but aligned with peer Cadence at 48x amid AI growth [7]. Compares to DCF sensitivity implying $620-$680 range assuming 12% WACC and 4% terminal growth. Upside skew from Ansys synergies; rating could shift to HOLD if China revenue declines >20% YoY.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive long-term bias; Sector stance: Market-Weight.

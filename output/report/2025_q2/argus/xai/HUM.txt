### Analyst’s Notes
• Humana's Q1 2025 premiums revenue reached $28.6B, up 10% YoY, driven by 5% membership growth in Medicare Advantage to 5.5M members [3]; however, medical benefit ratio rose to 89.0%, pressuring margins [3].
• Adjusted EPS for Q1 2025 was $6.11, down from $9.38 in Q1 2024, reflecting higher utilization and benefit costs [3]; full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance reaffirmed at $16.00 [3].
• Individual Medicare Advantage membership grew 8% YoY, but group segment declined 2% amid competitive pricing [3]; management noted ongoing utilization trends as a key watch item.
• Operating expenses increased 12% YoY to $4.2B, with operating cost ratio at 13.5%, up 20 bps, due to investments in digital health tools [3].
• Cross-border exposure remains minimal, with 99% of revenues from U.S. operations; no material updates to international strategy in Q1 [3].
• Thesis update: Maintaining HOLD as Q2 outlook hinges on utilization normalization; assumption of flat Q2 membership growth if no new data available.

### Investment Thesis
Humana benefits from secular tailwinds in the aging U.S. population and rising demand for Medicare Advantage plans, which comprise over 80% of its premiums [4]. The company's focus on value-based care and integrated pharmacy benefits supports margin stability, with historical operating margins averaging 4-5% and free cash flow generation exceeding $3B annually [4]. Share buybacks have reduced outstanding shares by 10% over the past three years, complemented by a consistent dividend payout ratio of around 20% [4].

Near-term catalysts include potential regulatory clarity on Medicare rates for 2026 and expansion in Medicaid managed care, addressing a $500B+ addressable market [5]. Product pillars like CenterWell health services and pharmacy benefit management provide monetization vectors through ancillary revenues, projected to grow 15% in 2025 [5]. However, elevated medical costs pose risks to EPS growth, limiting upside unless utilization moderates.

Overall, Humana's defensive positioning in healthcare supports long-term compounding, but current multiples reflect balanced risks and rewards.

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-04-24, Humana reported Q1 2025 earnings with revenues of $29.6B (up 11% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $6.11 (down 35% YoY), citing higher inpatient admissions; guidance for full-year revenues raised to $116B [3].
• Management reaffirmed 2025 adjusted EPS at $16.00, with expected Medicare Advantage membership growth of 1.5% (down from prior 3%), due to benefit design changes [3].
• No major M&A announced; prior acquisition of Kindred at Home in 2021 continues to integrate, contributing $2B in annual revenues [4].
• Regulatory update: CMS finalized 2026 Medicare Advantage rates with a 3.7% increase, below expectations, potentially impacting 2025 bidding [5].
• Capital returns: Authorized $3B share repurchase program extension through 2025; $1B repurchased in Q1 2025 [3].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Humana's revenue is primarily driven by premiums (94% of total), with growth tied to membership enrollment and rate adjustments. Medicare Advantage volumes grew 5% in Q1 2025, but higher utilization inflated benefits expense, leading to a medical benefit ratio of 89.0% (up 270 bps YoY) [3]. Operating leverage is evident in administrative efficiencies, though incentives like provider rebates moderate net margins. For FY25, EPS bridge includes $2.00 headwind from utilization, offset by $1.50 from premium growth [Assumption: based on management commentary patterns].

| Year/Quarter | Revenues ($B) | Adj. EPS ($) | Membership (M) | Med. Benefit Ratio (%) |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| FY2022      | 92.9         | 25.2        | 17.0          | 86.3                   |
| FY2023      | 106.4        | 25.0        | 17.2          | 86.4                   |
| FY2024      | 109.2        | 18.9        | 17.4          | 88.1                   |
| Q1 2025     | 29.6         | 6.1         | 17.5          | 89.0                   |

Humana sits on the value side of the spectrum with a lower P/E versus growth peers like UNH, reflecting Medicare focus and recent EPS pressure; industry faces regulatory scrutiny on costs.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Humana holds $17B in cash and short-term investments, with working capital of $10B and debt-to-equity of 0.7x, supporting medium-high financial strength rating due to consistent cash flows from premiums [4]. Dividend policy targets 20% payout, with annual growth of 8% over five years; ttm yield 1.0% [1]. Buybacks average $2B annually, expected to reduce shares by 2-3% in 2025 [Assumption: based on historical trends]. Rating justified by low leverage and $4B+ annual FCF [4].

### Management & Risks
CEO Bruce Broussard (tenure since 2013) and CFO Susan Diamond (since 2020) provide stable leadership, with transparent guidance on utilization metrics [3].
• Regulatory risk: Changes in Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates could reduce revenues by 2-5% [5].
• Macro risk: Inflation in medical costs may elevate benefit ratios above 88% [3].
• Competitive risk: Rivals like UnitedHealth gaining market share in Medicaid [6].
• Geopolitical risk: Minimal, as operations are U.S.-centric; supply chain disruptions in pharma could indirectly affect costs [Assumption: no direct citation].
• Operational risk: Higher-than-expected utilization in senior care, as seen in Q1 2025 [3].

### Company Description
Humana Inc. is a leading U.S. health insurance provider, operating through brands like Humana Medicare Advantage and CenterWell for senior-focused services. With a footprint in all 50 states, it serves over 17 million members via managed care plans, emphasizing integrated healthcare, pharmacy benefits, and home health. Core products include individual and group insurance, Medicaid, and wellness programs, generating revenues primarily from premiums and services.

### Valuation
Target price of $290 derived from 16x multiple on FY26 estimated EPS of $18.10 (DCF cross-checked), comparable to peer average of 15-18x [2,6]; implies 10% premium to historical 14x average, reflecting membership recovery. Upside skew limited by cost pressures; downgrade to SELL if EPS guidance cut below $15, upgrade to BUY on membership acceleration above 3%.

### Ratings Reference
**BUY:** Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
**HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with benchmark (+/-10%).  
**SELL:** Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-Month Rating: HOLD; Five-Year Stance: Positive (demographic tailwinds); Sector Stance: Market-Weight.

### Analyst’s Notes (250 words)
• Amgen reported Q1 2025 total revenues with strong contributions from fourteen products achieving double-digit sales growth, including Repatha, Blincyto, Tezspire, Evenity, Tavneos, and Uplizna, driven by global demand [1]. 
• Product launches advanced, with IMDELLTRA generating $81 million in sales during the quarter following its April 2025 launch, supported by Phase 3 confirmatory data showing improved overall survival versus chemotherapy [1]. 
• EPS impacted by an unrealized gain on BeiGene equity investment, offsetting an $800 million Otezla intangible asset impairment charge, compared to prior year [1]. 
• Guidance for FY 2025 implies continued momentum, with robust performance in oncology and rare disease portfolios, though specific Q2 KPIs remain forward-looking [1]. 
• R&D investments ramped up for pipeline advancement, with successful Phase 3 trials for multiple products enhancing long-term growth prospects [2]. 
• Thesis update: Maintain positive outlook on Amgen's diversified portfolio and innovation focus, despite near-term impairment headwinds; expect volume-driven revenue growth of 10-15% in coming quarters based on Q1 trends [1].

### Investment Thesis
Amgen benefits from secular drivers in biotechnology, including aging populations, rising demand for innovative therapies in oncology, inflammation, and rare diseases, and expanding global access to biologics. The company's margin profile remains solid, with non-GAAP operating margins improving on volume growth and operational efficiencies, supporting strong free cash flow generation for R&D reinvestment and shareholder returns [1]. Amgen's capital allocation includes consistent dividend growth and share buybacks, with $1.2 billion in repurchases in 2024, positioning it for sustained EPS accretion [4].

The addressable market exceeds $200 billion across core therapeutic areas, underpinned by product pillars like Prolia, Enbrel, and emerging assets such as IMDELLTRA and MariTide. Monetization vectors include volume expansion in ex-U.S. markets (up 15% in Q4 2024 excluding acquisitions) and value-added services like biosimilars, which contributed to 11% product sales growth in Q4 2024 [4]. Near-term catalysts include additional Phase 3 readouts and potential label expansions, bolstering revenue diversification amid patent cliffs.

### Recent Developments
• Amgen reported Q1 2025 financial results on May 1, 2025, highlighting double-digit sales growth for 14 products and $81 million from IMDELLTRA launch, partially offset by $800 million Otezla impairment [1]. 
• FY 2025 guidance reaffirmed strong global demand, with ongoing new product launches and Phase 3 successes noted in the earnings release [2]. 
• In Q4 2024 results announced February 4, 2025, total revenues reached $9.1 billion (+11% YoY), driven by 14% volume growth across products, excluding Horizon acquisition impacts [4]. 
• No major M&A announced pre-May 2025; prior Horizon integration contributed to sales, with ten products showing double-digit growth in Q4 2024 [4]. 
• Regulatory updates include IMDELLTRA Phase 3 confirmation of overall survival benefits, supporting U.S. launch momentum [1]. 
• Capital returns: Continued dividend at prior levels; $800 million tax deposit in Q1 2024 noted, with no new buyback updates in Q1 2025 filings [1].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Amgen's revenue drivers include product volume growth (14% in Q4 2024) across key franchises like oncology and general medicine, with cross-border expansion contributing to ex-U.S. sales. Incentive dynamics involve rebates and pricing pressures, but operating leverage from scale improved margins. For FY25, EPS bridge reflects volume gains offset by impairments and R&D spend; Q1 2025 showed unrealized gains boosting results versus prior year [1].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Non-GAAP EPS ($) | Product Sales Growth (%) |

| FY 2022     | 26.3       | 1.0           | 17.4            | 2.0                     |
| FY 2023     | 28.2       | 7.2           | 18.7            | 6.0                     |
| FY 2024     | 30.9       | 9.6           | 19.8            | 11.0                    |
| Q1 2025     | 7.4        | 8.0           | 3.9             | 10.0                    |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Biogen (BIIB, mkt cap $32B, 1-yr EPS growth -5%, FY P/E 15.1x, op margin 22%, Rating: HOLD), Gilead (GILD, $90B, +2%, 14.8x, 30%, HOLD), Regeneron (REGN, $110B, +12%, 22.5x, 35%, BUY), and Vertex (VRTX, $120B, +15%, 25.2x, 40%, BUY). Amgen positions as a value-growth hybrid, with stable dividends and pipeline upside versus peers' higher volatility.

| Company | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | FY P/E (x) | Op Margin (%) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| AMGN   | 168         | 6.0           | 18.2      | 32.0         |
| BIIB   | 32          | -5.0          | 15.1      | 22.0         |
| GILD   | 90          | 2.0           | 14.8      | 30.0         |
| REGN   | 110         | 12.0          | 22.5      | 35.0         |
| VRTX   | 120         | 15.0          | 25.2      | 40.0         |

Amgen trades at a discount to growth peers like Vertex on P/E, reflecting mature portfolio, but outperforms on financial strength.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Amgen maintains a robust balance sheet with $10.5 billion in cash and equivalents (end-2024), positive working capital, and debt/equity ratio of 4.5x, supported by strong FCF of $8.5 billion in 2024 [4]. Payout policy targets 50% of adjusted earnings via dividends, with ttm yield ~2.9%; buybacks averaged $2 billion annually pre-2025. Financial Strength Rating: High, justified by consistent cash generation and low default risk. Dividend grew 10% annually over five years through 2024; share count expected to decline modestly via repurchases if trends continue [3].

### Management & Risks
CEO Robert A. Bradway (tenure since 2012) and CFO Peter Griffith provide transparent guidance, with quarterly calls emphasizing pipeline metrics [5]. 
• Regulatory risks: Potential FDA delays or adverse rulings on pipeline assets like MariTide [1]. 
• Macro risks: Inflation in R&D costs and healthcare policy changes impacting pricing [4]. 
• Competitive risks: Biosimilar erosion for legacy products like Enbrel [1]. 
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions from global tensions affecting ex-U.S. sales [4]. 
• Impairment risks: Additional charges similar to $800 million Otezla in Q1 2025 [1]. 
• Acquisition integration risks: Ongoing Horizon synergies may underperform [4].

### Company Description
Amgen Inc. is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics. Its network includes leading brands like Repatha for cardiovascular disease, Blincyto for oncology, and Prolia for bone health, with a footprint in over 100 countries. Product scope spans general medicine, oncology, inflammation, and rare diseases, leveraging biologics and biosimilars for patient care.

### Valuation
Target price of $360 derived from blended P/E multiple of 19.5x applied to FY26 EPS estimate of $18.50, compared to peer average of 20x (e.g., Regeneron at 22.5x) and Amgen's 5-year historical average of 17x [6]. This implies 15% upside from current levels, with positive skew from pipeline catalysts; downside limited by dividend support. Rating would shift to HOLD on sustained EPS misses below 5% growth.

### Ratings Reference
**BUY**: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
**HOLD**: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
**SELL**: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-Month Rating: BUY; Five-Year Stance: Positive; Sector Stance: Over-Weight.

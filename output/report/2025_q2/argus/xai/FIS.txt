### Analyst’s Notes
• FIS reported Q1 2025 adjusted revenue of $2.47B, up 3% YoY, driven by 4% growth in Banking Solutions and 2% in Capital Markets, with Merchant Solutions flat amid macroeconomic pressures [3].
• Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 41.2%, up 120 bps YoY, reflecting operating leverage from cost controls and reduced incentives, though net earnings were $724M, including one-time gains [3].
• Processed transactions grew 5% YoY to 12.1B in Q1, with cross-border volumes up 7%, supported by expansion in digital payments and new client wins in emerging markets [5].
• Management raised FY2025 adjusted revenue guidance to $10.1B–$10.2B from $10.0B–$10.1B, implying 3–4% organic growth, with EPS outlook at $4.88–$4.98, citing resilience in core banking [3].
• Near-term Q2 context points to modest acceleration in payments volume, with assumption of 4–5% YoY growth based on industry trends, though cross-border remains sensitive to FX volatility [Assumption based on pre-2025-05-07 trends].
• Thesis update: Maintaining HOLD as FIS's shift toward value-added services like data analytics shows promise, but competitive pricing in merchant acquiring caps upside; monitoring for M&A integration efficiencies.

### Investment Thesis
Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) benefits from secular drivers in fintech, including digital transformation in banking and rising demand for integrated payment solutions. The company's core segments—Banking Solutions, Merchant Solutions, and Capital Markets—address a $100B+ global market for financial technology, with FIS holding a 10–15% share in key areas like core processing [5]. Monetization vectors include transaction-based fees, software licensing, and value-added services such as fraud prevention and analytics, which contributed 25% of Q1 2025 revenue [3]. Margin profile remains solid at 40%+ adjusted EBITDA, supported by scale and cost synergies from prior acquisitions, enabling free cash flow generation of $2.5B annually for buybacks and dividends [3].

Near-term catalysts include potential recovery in cross-border payments as global trade stabilizes, alongside product expansions like cloud-based platforms. FIS's capital return strategy features a 2.6% dividend yield and $3.5B in authorized buybacks, reducing shares by 5% over the past year [3]. However, thesis hinges on execution amid regulatory scrutiny and competition from fintech disruptors, positioning FIS for mid-single-digit growth but warranting caution on valuation multiples above historical norms.

### Recent Developments
• On May 6, 2025, FIS reported Q1 2025 results with adjusted revenue of $2.47B (up 3% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $1.10 (up 8% YoY), meeting estimates; guidance raised for FY2025 [4].
• In February 2025, FIS announced a strategic partnership to enhance digital wallet capabilities, aiming to boost Merchant Solutions growth [2].
• No major M&A in early 2025, following the 2023 Worldpay spin-off; focus on organic growth and debt reduction [5].
• Regulatory items include ongoing compliance with global data privacy rules, with no material updates pre-May 2025 [1].
• Capital returns updated with $500M in Q1 share repurchases and quarterly dividend maintained at $0.36 per share [3].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
FIS revenue is driven by transaction volumes (45% of total), processed transactions, and cross-border activity, with incentives as a variable offset (typically 10–15% of gross revenue). Operating leverage stems from fixed-cost structure in software platforms, yielding margin expansion as volumes grow. For FY2025, EPS bridge includes base growth of $0.30 from revenue, $0.20 from margin gains, offset by $0.10 in higher interest; assumption of flat incentives YoY [Assumption based on Q1 trends].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Adj. EBITDA ($B) | Adj. EPS ($) | Transactions (B) |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| FY2022      | 9.7        | 4.5            | 3.9             | 3.95        | 45.2            |
| FY2023      | 9.8        | 1.0            | 4.0             | 4.20        | 46.8            |
| FY2024      | 9.9        | 1.0            | 4.1             | 4.65        | 48.5            |
| Q1 2025     | 2.5        | 3.0            | 1.0             | 1.10        | 12.1            |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Global Payments (GPN, mkt cap $27B, 1-yr EPS growth 10%, curr FY P/E 12.5, margin 45%, our rating HOLD), Fiserv (FI, mkt cap $92B, 1-yr EPS growth 12%, curr FY P/E 20.0, margin 42%, our rating BUY), and PayPal (PYPL, mkt cap $62B, 1-yr EPS growth 15%, curr FY P/E 15.2, margin 18%, our rating HOLD) [1][2]. FIS sits in the middle on value-growth axes, with stable margins but slower EPS growth versus disruptors like PYPL, trading at a premium to GPN due to diversified banking exposure.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | Curr FY P/E | Adj. EBITDA Mgn (%) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| GPN | 27          | 10              | 12.5       | 45                 |
| FI  | 92          | 12              | 20.0       | 42                 |
| PYPL| 62          | 15              | 15.2       | 18                 |
| FIS | 41          | 8               | 18.5       | 41                 |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
FIS holds $440M in cash and $3.2B in working capital as of Q1 2025, with debt/equity at 0.8x following reductions post-Worldpay spin-off [3]. Payout policy targets 35% of FCF to dividends, with buybacks absorbing the rest; $500M repurchased in Q1, expected to reduce shares by 3–4% in FY2025 [3]. Dividend grew 5% annually over past three years, yielding 2.6% [4]. Financial Strength Rating Medium-High justified by strong cash flow ($800M in Q1) and investment-grade credit, though leverage requires monitoring.

### Management & Risks
CEO Stephanie Ferris (tenure since 2022) and CFO James Kehoe (since 2023) have emphasized transparent guidance, with quarterly updates on segment metrics [5]. Risks include:
• Regulatory: Potential antitrust scrutiny on payment networks, as seen in global probes [1].
• Macro: Economic slowdown impacting transaction volumes, with cross-border down 5% in weak quarters [3].
• Competitive: Pressure from fintech entrants like Stripe eroding merchant margins [2].
• Geopolitical: FX volatility affecting 20% of revenue from international operations [5].
• Execution: Integration risks from tech upgrades, potentially delaying 2–3% of projected growth [Assumption].

### Company Description
Fidelity National Information Services provides technology solutions for financial institutions, merchants, and capital markets globally. Its network includes core banking platforms, payment processing, and risk management tools, operating in over 100 countries with brands like Worldpay (post-spin-off affiliation) and serving 95% of the world's largest banks [5].

### Valuation
Target price of $80 derived from 18x FY2026 EPS estimate of $5.20 (DCF cross-checked with multiples), a 5% discount to five-year average P/E of 19x and aligned with peer FI at 20x [2][4]. Implies 8% upside from May 7 close; skew moderately positive on growth catalysts, but downside if volumes disappoint. Rating would upgrade to BUY on sustained margin expansion above 42%, or downgrade to SELL on EPS misses below $4.80.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by 10%+ on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by 10%+.  
12-month rating: HOLD; Five-year stance: Positive long-term; Sector stance: Market-Weight.

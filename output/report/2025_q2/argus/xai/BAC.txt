### Analyst’s Notes
• Bank of America's Q1 2025 revenue reached $27.5B, up from prior periods, driven by net interest income stability despite macro headwinds; beat expectations by $0.5B [1]. 
• EPS for Q1 2025 came in at $0.90, exceeding consensus of $0.82, reflecting controlled expenses and lower provisions amid tariff-related concerns [1]. 
• Deposits grew modestly YoY, supporting liquidity; CET1 ratio held steady around 11.8%, indicating robust capital position [2]. 
• Noninterest income showed flat performance, impacted by trading volatility, but overall net income trends positive versus Q4 2024's $6.67B [3]. 
• Guidance for FY25 suggests net interest income growth in low single digits, with expense discipline; no major changes post-Q1 [Assumption: Based on historical patterns]. 
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on balance sheet strength and potential rate tailwinds, though geopolitical risks weigh on near-term sentiment [3].

### Investment Thesis
Bank of America benefits from secular drivers in digital banking and wealth management, with a vast deposit base exceeding $1.9T enabling low-cost funding and net interest margin expansion in a higher-rate environment [4]. The company's diversified revenue streams, including consumer banking, global markets, and Merrill Lynch, position it to capture growth in payments and advisory services, targeting mid-single-digit revenue CAGR through 2025 amid expanding U.S. consumer spending [Assumption: CAGR projection from pre-2025 trends].

Margin profiles remain solid, with operating leverage from tech investments reducing noninterest expenses as a percentage of revenue; free cash flow supports $20B+ annual buybacks and dividend payouts, yielding over 2.5% [5]. Near-term catalysts include potential Federal Reserve rate cuts boosting loan demand and cross-selling in value-added services like cash management, addressing a $5T+ addressable market in corporate and consumer flows [4].

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-04-15, Bank of America reported Q1 2025 earnings with EPS of $0.90 (beat $0.82 consensus) and revenue of $27.5B (beat $27B), highlighting resilient net interest income amid economic uncertainty [1]. 
• Q4 2024 results, released 2025-01-16, showed net income of $6.67B or $0.82 per share, more than doubling YoY due to lower provisions and fee income growth [3]. 
• No major M&A announced in early 2025; focus on organic growth in digital platforms [4]. 
• Regulatory updates include ongoing compliance with Basel III requirements, with CET1 ratio at 11.8% as of Q1 2024 historicals [2]; no new legal items post-2024. 
• Capital returns: Continued share buybacks of ~$7B in 2024, with dividend at $0.24 quarterly; no changes signaled for 2025 [5].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include net interest income (NII) from loans and deposits, with Q1 2025 showing stability despite flat noninterest income; transaction volumes in consumer and markets segments grew modestly YoY [1]. Client incentives remain low, aiding margins, while operating leverage stems from expense controls targeting 1-2% growth [Assumption: Based on prior guidance]. EPS bridge for FY25 assumes mid-single-digit NII growth offset by potential provision increases, yielding ~$3.50 EPS [Assumption: Projection from historicals].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | EPS ($) | NII ($B) | Net Income ($B) |
|--------------|-------------:|--------:|---------:|----------------:|
| FY2022      |        94.9 |    3.19 |     52.5 |            27.5 |
| FY2023      |       101.2 |    3.57 |     57.8 |            28.9 |
| FY2024      |       102.5 |    3.40 |     56.0 |            26.5 |
| Q1 2025     |        27.5 |    0.90 |     14.2 |             7.2 |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include JPMorgan Chase (JPM, market cap $550B, 1-yr EPS growth 8%, current FY P/E 11.8x, net margin 28%, our rating BUY), Citigroup (C, $120B, 5%, 10.2x, 22%, HOLD), and Wells Fargo (WFC, $200B, 6%, 12.0x, 25%, BUY). Bank of America sits in the value quadrant with lower P/E versus growth peers like fintech disruptors, offering defensive appeal in a volatile rate environment.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Grw (%) | Curr FY P/E | Net Margin (%) | Rating |
|------|-------------:|-----------------:|------------:|---------------:|--------|
| JPM  |         550 |               8.0 |        11.8 |           28.0 | BUY   |
| C    |         120 |               5.0 |        10.2 |           22.0 | HOLD  |
| WFC  |         200 |               6.0 |        12.0 |           25.0 | BUY   |
| BAC  |         300 |               7.0 |        12.5 |           26.0 | BUY   |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet features $320B cash and equivalents, positive working capital, and debt/equity of 1.1x, underpinned by $1.9T deposits [4]. Payout policy targets 30% of earnings via dividends, with consistent quarterly payments; buybacks averaged $25B over 2022-2024, reducing shares by 2-3% annually [5]. Dividend grew 8% YoY in 2024 to $0.96 ttm; expect flat-to-modest growth in 2025 [Assumption: Based on trends]. Financial Strength Rating Medium-High justified by CET1 above 11% and low leverage versus peers [2].

### Management & Risks
CEO Brian Moynihan (tenure since 2010) and CFO Alastair Borthwick (since 2021) provide steady guidance with quarterly updates; no recent changes [4].
• Regulatory risks from evolving Basel rules could increase capital requirements, impacting returns [4]. 
• Macro slowdown, including recession fears from tariff policies, may elevate loan losses [3]. 
• Competitive pressures from fintechs eroding deposit share [Assumption: Industry trend]. 
• Geopolitical tensions affecting global markets revenue, as seen in trading volatility [3]. 
• Credit risk in commercial lending amid higher rates [5].

### Company Description

With operations in over 35 countries, it serves 68 million clients through 3,800 branches and digital channels, focusing on deposits, loans, payments, and advisory services.

### Valuation
Target price of $48 derived from 13x forward P/E multiple applied to FY25 EPS estimate of $3.70, comparable to JPM's 11.8x and historical BAC average of 12x [6]. Implies 25% upside from current levels, with downside skew limited by strong capital; rating could shift to HOLD on sustained EPS misses below $0.80 quarterly.

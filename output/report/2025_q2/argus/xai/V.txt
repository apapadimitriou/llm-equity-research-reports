### Analyst’s Notes
• Visa reported fiscal Q2 2025 net revenue of $9.59B, up 9% year-over-year, driven by steady payment volumes and cross-border activity, exceeding consensus estimates by $40M.
• Payments volume grew 8% year-over-year on a constant-dollar basis, reflecting resilient consumer spending despite macroeconomic headwinds.
• Cross-border volume increased 13% year-over-year, benefiting from travel recovery and e-commerce trends, contributing to overall transaction momentum.
• Processed transactions rose 9% year-over-year to support revenue growth, with value-added services adding incremental lift.
• Non-GAAP EPS reached $2.76, beating expectations by $0.08, aided by operating leverage and controlled expenses.
• Management reiterated full-year guidance for low double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS expansion, while announcing a new $30B share buyback program to enhance capital returns.

### Investment Thesis
Visa maintains a dominant position in the global payments ecosystem, capitalizing on secular shifts toward digital transactions and cash displacement. Key drivers include expanding total addressable market estimated at over $185T in consumer payments, commercial flows, and government disbursements, with Visa's network processing more than 65% of global card transactions [1]. Monetization vectors such as consumer payments, new flows (e.g., B2B and P2P), and value-added services like risk management and tokenization continue to fuel mid-teens revenue CAGR potential, supported by high incremental margins above 60%.

The company's financial profile features robust free cash flow generation exceeding $18B annually, enabling consistent buybacks and dividend growth, with payouts covering less than 25% of earnings [2]. Near-term catalysts include partnerships for token network expansion and acquisitions like Pismo to bolster cloud-based issuance, positioning Visa for sustained 10-15% EPS growth through fiscal 2026.

### Recent Developments
• On April 29, 2025, Visa released fiscal Q2 2025 earnings, reporting net revenue of $9.59B (up 9% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $2.76 (up 10% YoY), with payments volume up 8% and cross-border volume up 13% [3].
• Management provided fiscal 2025 guidance for net revenue growth in the low double-digits and EPS growth in the mid-teens, unchanged from prior outlook [4].
• Visa authorized a new $30B share repurchase program, replacing the prior authorization, to continue reducing share count [3].
• No major M&A announced in the quarter, though ongoing regulatory scrutiny in payments antitrust cases persists without material updates [5].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Visa's revenue growth in fiscal Q2 2025 was propelled by volume increases and pricing discipline, offset partially by client incentives averaging 22% of gross revenues. Payments volume and processed transactions drove core service revenues, while cross-border fees benefited from international recovery. Operating leverage remained strong, with expenses up 7% YoY versus 9% revenue growth, yielding margin expansion. For fiscal 2025, EPS growth is bridged by 8-10% volume gains, modest incentive headwinds, and share repurchases reducing outstanding shares by 2-3%.

| Visa   |             530|                  10|               30.5|            61|

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Visa holds $18B in cash and equivalents with working capital of $10B and debt-to-equity of 0.5x, supporting high liquidity and investment-grade ratings [2]. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share (yield 0.8%), with 15% CAGR over five years, and targets 20-25% payout ratio. Buybacks averaged $12B annually, expected to continue reducing shares by 2% YoY. Financial Strength Rating is High, justified by consistent FCF conversion above 90% and minimal leverage.

### Management & Risks
CEO Ryan McInerney (tenure since 2023) and CFO Chris Suh (tenure since 2022) have maintained transparent guidance, focusing on volume metrics and incentive trends in earnings calls [4].
• Regulatory risks include ongoing antitrust scrutiny from DOJ on debit routing, potentially impacting 5-10% of U.S. revenues [5].
• Macroeconomic slowdowns could pressure consumer spending, reducing payments volume by 2-5% in recessions [1].
• Competitive threats from fintechs like Stripe and open banking initiatives may erode market share in new flows [6].
• Geopolitical tensions, including trade restrictions, pose risks to cross-border volumes, which comprise 25% of revenues [1].
• Currency fluctuations could impact reported growth, with 40% of revenues international [2].

### Company Description
Visa operates a global payments technology network, connecting consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments in over 200 countries. Its core brands include Visa, Visa Electron, and PLUS, facilitating debit, credit, and prepaid transactions. Product scope encompasses consumer payments, commercial solutions, value-added services like fraud prevention, and emerging offerings in tokenization and digital wallets.

### Valuation
Our $310 target price is derived from a 32x multiple applied to fiscal 2026 EPS estimate of $9.70, a premium to historical 28x average but aligned with peers like Mastercard at 32x amid superior growth [6]. This implies 15% upside from current levels. Upside skew is positive on volume acceleration; we would downgrade to HOLD on sustained regulatory setbacks or EPS misses below 10% growth.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform benchmark by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive; Sector stance: Market-Weight.

### Analyst’s Notes
• Q1 FY26 (ended April 30, 2025) product revenue rose 34% y/y to $1.00B, beating estimates by $30M, driven by 34% y/y growth in remaining performance obligations to $6.7B [3].
• Customer metrics showed strength with total customers up 21% y/y to 10,000+, and high-value customers (> $1M trailing product revenue) increasing 28% y/y to 510; net revenue retention held at 124% [3].
• Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 9%, reflecting operating leverage from scale, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 beating estimates by $0.03 [3].
• Q2 FY26 guidance calls for product revenue of $1.04B, implying 30% y/y growth, above consensus of $1.01B, supported by AI and data sharing momentum [3].
• FY26 product revenue guidance raised to $4.3B, up 30% y/y, with free cash flow margin expected at 25%, signaling confidence in consumption-based model [3].
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on secular AI data trends, though monitoring consumption volatility; no material changes to estimates post-Q1 beat [3].

### Investment Thesis
Snowflake benefits from secular tailwinds in cloud data warehousing and AI analytics, with its platform enabling seamless data sharing and processing across clouds. The addressable market for data management is projected to exceed $100B by 2025, driven by enterprise migration to cloud and AI workloads [4]. Key product pillars include the AI Data Cloud for data engineering, analytics, and AI applications, with monetization via consumption-based pricing on storage, compute, and value-added services like Snowpark for AI development. Revenue growth is fueled by expanding customer cohorts and cross-sell, evidenced by 124% net retention in Q1 FY26 [3].

Margin profile remains attractive with non-GAAP gross margins at 75%+, supporting strong free cash flow generation (25% margin guidance for FY26) [3]. The company has no dividend but actively repurchases shares, with $2.5B authorized program as of Q1 FY26 [1]. Near-term catalysts include AI product launches and partnerships, potentially accelerating usage; however, macroeconomic sensitivity to consumption could temper growth if enterprise spending softens.

### Recent Developments
• On May 21, 2025, Snowflake reported Q1 FY26 results with product revenue of $1.00B (+34% y/y), EPS of $0.24, and raised FY26 product revenue guidance to $4.3B [3].
• Guidance for Q2 FY26 set at $1.04B in product revenue, reflecting expected 30% y/y growth amid stable consumption trends [3].
• No major M&A announced in the quarter; focus remained on organic innovation in AI and data collaboration [1].
• Regulatory items: Ongoing scrutiny of data privacy under GDPR and CCPA, with no new material legal developments reported [5].
• Capital returns: Continued share repurchases under $2.5B authorization, with $500M executed in FY25 [2].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue is primarily driven by product consumption (storage and compute), with Q1 FY26 showing 34% y/y volume growth and stable incentives (client rebates at 10-15% of revenue). Cross-border data flows and AI workloads contributed to 34% y/y RPO expansion. Operating leverage is evident in margin expansion, with opex growing slower than revenue (25% y/y vs. 33% revenue). EPS bridge for FY26 guidance implies $1.00 baseline, plus $0.20 from margins and $0.10 from buybacks, offset by $0.15 share dilution.

| Fiscal Year/Quarter | Revenue ($M) | Y/Y Growth (%) | Non-GAAP EPS ($) | Gross Margin (%) |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| FY23               | 2066       | 68.0          | 0.50            | 65.0            |
| FY24               | 2806       | 36.0          | 0.80            | 68.0            |
| FY25               | 3500       | 25.0          | 1.00            | 72.0            |
| Q1 FY26            | 1040       | 33.0          | 0.24            | 75.0            |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include cloud software firms like Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Dropbox (DBX), selected for data/analytics focus. Snowflake trades at a premium on P/E due to higher growth (30%+ revenue) vs. peers' 10-20%, but lags on margins (9% operating vs. 20%+ peer average). Positioned as high-growth on the Value-Growth axis, with emphasis on AI scalability over value-oriented stability.

| Company | Market Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E (x) | Op. Margin (%) | Rating |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------|
| ADBE   | 250            | 15.0               | 35.0              | 30.0          | BUY   |
| CRM    | 260            | 20.0               | 40.0              | 25.0          | HOLD  |
| NOW    | 160            | 25.0               | 50.0              | 20.0          | BUY   |
| DBX    | 8              | 10.0               | 15.0              | 18.0          | HOLD  |
| SNOW   | 54             | 30.0               | 150.0             | 9.0           | BUY   |

Data as of latest pre-2025-05-28 filings [6].

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet is robust with $4.5B cash and equivalents, positive working capital of $3.0B, and low debt/equity of 0.2x as of Q1 FY26 [3]. No dividend paid, consistent with growth focus; payout policy prioritizes reinvestment. Buyback cadence is steady, with $2.5B program authorizing up to 10% of shares annually [1]. Financial Strength Rating Medium-High justified by strong liquidity (current ratio 2.5x) and free cash flow positivity, though consumption model introduces revenue variability. Share count expected to decline 2-3% y/y via repurchases if guidance holds [3].

### Management & Risks
CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy assumed role in February 2024, bringing AI expertise; CFO Michael Scarpelli provides continuity since 2019. Management transparency is high via detailed guidance and metrics like RPO.

• Regulatory risks: Potential antitrust scrutiny on data monopolies and privacy laws (e.g., EU AI Act) could increase compliance costs [5].
• Macro risks: Economic downturns may reduce enterprise IT spending, impacting consumption revenue (evident in prior NRR declines) [2].
• Competitive risks: Intensifying rivalry from AWS, Google Cloud, and Databricks in AI data platforms [4].
• Geopolitical risks: Trade tensions affecting cross-border data flows, with 20% revenue international [1].
• Execution risks: Delays in AI product adoption could slow growth below 30% guidance [3].

### Company Description
Snowflake operates a cloud-based data platform, the AI Data Cloud, enabling organizations to store, manage, and analyze data across multiple public clouds without silos. Its network spans global footprints with brands focused on data warehousing, sharing, and AI workloads. Product scope includes tools for data engineering, analytics, applications, and collaboration, serving over 10,000 customers in diverse sectors [1].

### Valuation
Target price of $250 derived from 18x FY26 price/sales multiple applied to $14.00 sales per share, compared to peer average of 12x (e.g., NOW at 15x) and Snowflake's 5-year historical average of 20x [6]. Implies 30% upside from assumed current levels, with DCF sensitivity supporting range of $220-$280 assuming 25% FCF margin. Upside skew from AI catalysts; would downgrade to HOLD if growth falls below 25% or NRR dips under 120%.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive long-term; Sector stance: Over-Weight.

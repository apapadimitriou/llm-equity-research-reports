### Analyst’s Notes
• ServiceNow reported Q2 2025 subscription revenues of $3,113 million, up 22.5% year-over-year, driven by AI platform adoption and enterprise deals exceeding $1 million [1].
• Current remaining performance obligations (cRPO) grew 21% to $9.4 billion, reflecting strong backlog and visibility into future revenues [1].
• Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from operating leverage and cost discipline [1].
• Adjusted EPS reached $3.13, beating consensus estimates by $0.31, with free cash flow margin at 25% amid robust cash generation [1].
• Guidance raised for FY25 subscription revenues to $11.0-$11.05 billion (21-22% growth), citing momentum in generative AI workflows [1].
• Thesis update: AI integrations position ServiceNow for sustained high-teens growth, though FX headwinds and macro uncertainty warrant monitoring [2].

### Investment Thesis
ServiceNow benefits from secular tailwinds in digital transformation and AI adoption, with its Now Platform enabling workflow automation across IT, HR, and customer service. The addressable market for enterprise service management is estimated at $200 billion, growing at 15% annually, as companies shift to cloud-based solutions for efficiency [3]. Key product pillars include Vancouver and Washington releases incorporating generative AI, which drove 25% of Q2 net new annual contract value [1]. Monetization vectors focus on subscription-based pricing, value-added services like Pro Plus editions, and partnerships with firms like Microsoft for co-innovation.

The company's margin profile supports strong free cash flow generation, with FY24 FCF at $2.7 billion (25% margin) [4]. Capital returns emphasize share buybacks, with $1.5 billion authorized in 2024, reducing shares by 1-2% annually, though no dividend is paid [4]. Near-term catalysts include Q3 earnings and AI product launches, potentially accelerating cRPO growth to 22% in H2 2025.

Overall, ServiceNow's sticky customer base (98% renewal rate) and high switching costs underpin a premium valuation, with potential for EPS compounding at 25% through 2027 [3].

### Recent Developments
• On July 23, 2025, ServiceNow released Q2 2025 earnings, reporting total revenues of $3,215 million (up 22% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS of $3.13, exceeding expectations; cRPO rose 21% to $9.4 billion [1].
• FY25 guidance increased, with subscription revenues now expected at $11.0-$11.05 billion (up from prior $10.8-$10.85 billion) and non-GAAP operating margin at 30% [1].
• Announced strategic partnership expansions with IBM and AWS to enhance AI capabilities in the Now Platform, targeting new enterprise workflows [5].
• No major M&A in Q2, but ongoing integration of prior acquisitions like Atrinet (network automation) contributed to 2% revenue uplift [6].
• Regulatory: Continued compliance with EU data privacy rules; no new material legal items reported in Q2 10-Q filing [4].
• Capital returns: Executed $500 million in share repurchases in Q2, on track for full-year program [1].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
ServiceNow's revenue is driven by subscription volumes (98% of total), with Q2 growth fueled by 21% rise in cRPO and 15% increase in customers with >$1 million ACV [1]. Cross-border expansion added 10% to revenues, though FX headwinds reduced growth by 1 percentage point [1]. Client incentives remained stable at 5% of revenues, supporting retention. Operating leverage drove margin expansion, with opex growing 18% vs. 22% revenue growth [1]. EPS bridge for FY25 includes $0.50 from revenue upside, $0.30 from margins, offset by $0.10 FX impact (assumption based on trends).

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Salesforce (CRM, mkt cap $240B, 1-yr EPS growth 15%, FY P/E 35x, op margin 25%, rating HOLD), Workday (WDAY, $60B, 12%, 45x, 22%, HOLD), Adobe (ADBE, $240B, 10%, 40x, 35%, BUY), and Palantir (PLTR, $70B, 25%, 80x, 20%, BUY). ServiceNow leads on growth (20%+ revenue CAGR) but trades at a premium P/E due to AI exposure.

| Company | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E | Op Margin (%) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| NOW    | 170         | 25.0               | 90.2          | 30.5         |

ServiceNow sits on the growth axis, with superior margins vs. peers, justifying its valuation amid SaaS industry consolidation [3].

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows $5.2 billion cash and equivalents, working capital of $3.8 billion, and debt-to-equity of 0.3x as of Q2 2025 [4]. Low leverage (total debt $2.3 billion) supports high financial strength rating, aided by $3.0 billion annual FCF [1]. No dividend paid, focusing on growth; buybacks averaged $1.2 billion annually over three years, expected to continue reducing shares by 1.5% in FY25 [4]. Dividend growth not applicable; share count trended down 2% YoY in 2024 [4].

### Management & Risks
CEO Bill McDermott (tenure since 2019) and CFO Gina Mastantuono (since 2020) provide consistent guidance, with 90% accuracy on quarterly targets [3]. Transparency high via detailed earnings calls.

• Regulatory: Potential antitrust scrutiny on AI partnerships; EU GDPR compliance costs rose 5% in 2024 [4].
• Macro: Economic slowdown could delay enterprise spending, impacting 20% of revenues from cyclical sectors [1].
• Competitive: Intensifying rivalry from Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce, eroding 2-3% market share annually [3].
• Geopolitical: Supply chain disruptions from U.S.-China tensions affect 10% of operations [7].
• FX volatility: Headwinds reduced Q2 growth by 1pp; assumption of continued impact in H2 [1].

It serves over 8,100 customers in 80+ countries, focusing on subscription software for IT, employee, and customer experiences, with recent emphasis on AI-driven solutions.

### Valuation
Target price of $950 derived from 55x FY26 EPS estimate of $17.25, a 20% premium to 5-year average P/E of 45x, reflecting AI growth vs. peers like Adobe at 40x [3]. DCF sensitivity (10% discount rate, 5% terminal growth) supports $900-$1000 range. Upside skew positive on AI adoption; downgrade to HOLD if cRPO growth falls below 18%.

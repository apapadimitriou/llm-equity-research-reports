### Analyst’s Notes
• Assumption: Q2 2025 context centers on expected revenue stabilization, with total revenue projected at $2.35B, reflecting modest growth from Leqembi uptake offsetting declines in multiple sclerosis franchise.
• Key KPIs include product revenue growth: Spinraza at $430M (flat yoy), Vumerity up 5% to $140M, and Leqembi contributing $50M in global revenue share [1].
• Cross-border and partnership dynamics show Eisai collaboration on Leqembi driving 20% sequential increase in patient initiations, per recent updates.
• Revenue growth drivers: Assumption: 2% yoy increase, supported by cost-saving initiatives targeting $800M in annual savings by end-2025.
• Expense trends: Operating expenses down 10% yoy in prior quarter, with R&D at 18% of revenue, indicating improving leverage.
• Guidance: Full-year 2025 EPS outlook $15.00-$16.00, with no material changes; thesis update maintains hold due to pipeline potential balanced against competitive pressures.

### Investment Thesis
Biogen operates in a secularly growing neurology market, driven by an aging population and rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, with global market opportunity estimated at $15B by 2030 for anti-amyloid therapies [4]. The company's core pillars—multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs like Tecfidera and Vumerity, spinal muscular atrophy treatment Spinraza, and Alzheimer's drug Leqembi (partnered with Eisai)—position it for mid-single-digit revenue growth. Margin expansion is supported by the Fit for Growth program, aiming for 300-400 bps improvement in operating margins through 2025, bolstering free cash flow generation at $1.5B annually. Capital returns focus on share buybacks, with $1.5B authorized in 2024, though no dividend is paid.

Near-term catalysts include Leqembi subcutaneous formulation approval (expected mid-2025) and potential label expansions, enhancing monetization via consumer access and value-added services like diagnostics. Addressable market expansion targets new flows in rare diseases and immunology, with biosimilars contributing 10% of revenue. Risks to thesis include slower Leqembi adoption, but overall profile supports steady EPS growth of 5-7% through 2027.

### Recent Developments
• Biogen reported Q1 2025 earnings on 2025-04-24, with revenue of $2.29B (down 7% yoy) and adjusted EPS of $3.43 (vs. consensus $3.45); product revenue fell due to MS franchise erosion [1].
• Guidance for FY2025 reiterated revenue decline in low single digits and adjusted EPS $15-$16, reflecting confidence in new product ramps [1].
• Notable deal: Expanded collaboration with Eisai on Leqembi, including data from ongoing trials showing 27% reduction in clinical decline [3].
• Regulatory update: FDA review ongoing for Leqembi maintenance dosing; no major legal setbacks reported in Q1 [4].
• Capital returns: $500M in share repurchases completed in Q1 2025, reducing shares outstanding by 1% [6].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include volume growth in core products, with MS franchise at 50% of sales but facing generic competition, while Leqembi and Spinraza provide uplift through patient volume and pricing. Incentives and rebates pressure net pricing, averaging 40% discounts in MS. Operating leverage improves via cost cuts, with Q1 2025 operating margin at 25% (up 200 bps yoy). EPS bridge for FY2025: Base $14.50, plus $1.50 from new products and savings, minus $0.50 from legacy declines, targeting $15.50 midpoint. Assumption: Q2 2025 EPS at $3.80, supported by seasonal trends.

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Amgen (AMGN, $150B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 8%, curr FY P/E 16.5, margin 35%, our rating: HOLD), Gilead (GILD, $90B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 5%, curr FY P/E 14.0, margin 30%, our rating: BUY), and Vertex (VRTX, $120B mkt cap, 1-yr EPS growth 12%, curr FY P/E 25.0, margin 40%, our rating: BUY). Biogen sits in the value quadrant with lower P/E vs. growth peers like Vertex, reflecting mature portfolio but discounted valuation amid turnaround efforts.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows cash of $1.1B, working capital $2.5B, and debt/equity ratio of 0.4, with total debt at $6.5B [6]. No dividend paid, consistent with biotech focus on reinvestment; buyback program active, with $1B repurchased in 2024, expected to reduce shares by 2-3% annually. Financial Strength Rating of Medium-High justified by strong cash flow ($1.2B FCF in 2024) and low leverage, though dependent on pipeline success. Assumption: No dividend initiation expected in 2025.

### Management & Risks
CEO Christopher Viehbacher (tenure since 2022) and CFO Michael McDonnell provide transparent guidance, with quarterly updates on Leqembi metrics. Management emphasizes cost discipline and pipeline advancement.
• Regulatory risks: Potential delays in Alzheimer's drug approvals, as seen with Aduhelm controversy [4].
• Macro risks: Economic slowdown impacting healthcare spending, with 5% revenue sensitivity to GDP changes [6].
• Competitive risks: Increasing rivalry in MS from generics and in Alzheimer's from Lilly's donanemab [3].
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions in Europe/Asia, affecting 30% of revenue [1].
• Patent expirations: Tecfidera generics eroding $1B in annual sales [6].

### Company Description
Biogen Inc. is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and delivering therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Its portfolio includes leading brands in multiple sclerosis (Tecfidera, Vumerity), spinal muscular atrophy (Spinraza), and Alzheimer's (Leqembi via Eisai partnership). With operations in over 30 countries, Biogen leverages a vast network for clinical trials and commercialization, emphasizing innovative biologics and biosimilars.

### Valuation
Target price of $250 derived from multiples approach: 16x FY2025 EPS estimate of $15.60, a premium to historical 14x average but discount to peers at 18x, reflecting Leqembi growth [5]. Compares to Gilead at 14x. Implies 16% upside from current levels; skew neutral, with downside if Leqembi uptake disappoints. Rating would upgrade to BUY on stronger-than-expected Q2 results or positive regulatory news.

HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).

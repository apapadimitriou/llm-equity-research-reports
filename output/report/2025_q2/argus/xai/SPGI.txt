### Analyst’s Notes
• Q1 2025 revenue reached $3.49B, up 10% YoY, driven by 14% growth in Ratings and 8% in Market Intelligence, though offset by flat Commodity Insights [1].
• Adjusted EPS of $4.01 beat consensus by 12%, reflecting operating margin expansion to 48.5% from cost controls and revenue leverage [1].
• Billings growth accelerated to 11% YoY, signaling robust pipeline in data and analytics services amid economic uncertainty [1].
• Guidance for FY2025 raised to 6-8% revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $13.75-$14.00, incorporating AI-driven product enhancements [1].
• Cross-segment synergies from IHS Markit integration continue, with $150M in run-rate savings realized, boosting free cash flow outlook to $4.0B [2].
• Macro headwinds persist, but private market data demand remains a tailwind, with subscriptions up 9% [3].

### Investment Thesis
S&P Global benefits from secular drivers in financial data and analytics, including increasing demand for credit ratings, market intelligence, and sustainability insights amid regulatory complexity and digital transformation. The company's diversified portfolio spans Ratings (40% of revenue), Market Intelligence (30%), and Commodity Insights (15%), positioning it to capture growth in global capital markets, where addressable market is estimated at $50B annually [3]. Monetization vectors include subscription-based models, value-added services like AI-powered analytics, and expansion into private markets, which grew 12% YoY in recent quarters [1].

Margin profile remains strong, with adjusted operating margins above 45%, supporting robust free cash flow generation projected at $4.0B for FY2025, enabling consistent buybacks ($1.5B authorized) and dividend growth (10% CAGR over 5 years) [2]. Near-term catalysts include potential M&A in data tech and easing interest rates boosting issuance volumes, potentially driving 8-10% EPS growth [1]. Overall, SPGI's network effects and data moat underpin a premium multiple, with upside from emerging markets and ESG products.

### Recent Developments
• On April 25, 2025, S&P Global reported Q1 2025 earnings with revenue of $3.49B (+10% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $4.01 (+15% YoY), exceeding expectations due to strong Ratings issuance [1].
• FY2025 guidance updated to revenue growth of 6-8% and adjusted EPS of $13.75-14.00, reflecting confidence in subscription stability [1].
• Announced expansion of AI capabilities in Market Intelligence platform, integrating generative tools for client workflows, with pilot launches in Q1 [4].
• Regulatory update: Continued monitoring of EU antitrust scrutiny on data practices, with no material changes as of Q1 reporting [3].
• Capital returns: Declared quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share and repurchased $300M in shares during Q1 [2].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include transaction volumes in Ratings (sensitive to issuance activity), subscription growth in Market Intelligence, and pricing power in Commodity Insights. Client incentives remain modest at 5% of revenue, supporting retention. Operating leverage is evident from margin expansion, with opex growth lagging revenue by 4 points in Q1 [1]. EPS bridge for FY2025 projects base growth from operations (+10%), buybacks (+2%), offset by potential macro slowdown (-1-2%) [Assumption: Based on historical trends].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY % | Adj. EPS ($) | YoY % | Op. Margin % |
|--------------|-------------|-------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| FY2022      | 11.2       | 7.5  | 11.2       | 5.0  | 45.1        |
| FY2023      | 12.5       | 11.6 | 12.5       | 11.6 | 46.8        |
| FY2024      | 13.3       | 6.4  | 13.1       | 4.8  | 47.5        |
| Q1 2025     | 3.5        | 10.0 | 4.0        | 15.0 | 48.5        |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Moody's (MCO, $80B mkt cap, 8% 1-yr EPS growth, 28x P/E, 50% margin, BUY), FactSet (FDS, $16B mkt cap, 6% growth, 30x P/E, 35% margin, HOLD), Morningstar (MORN, $10B mkt cap, 5% growth, 25x P/E, 28% margin, HOLD), and Thomson Reuters (TRI, $70B mkt cap, 7% growth, 27x P/E, 40% margin, BUY). SPGI sits on the growth axis with superior EPS momentum but trades at a premium to value-oriented peers like MORN due to its scale and diversification.

| Peer | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr % | Curr FY P/E | Margin % | Rating |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| MCO | 80.0       | 8.0          | 28.0       | 50.0    | BUY    |
| FDS | 16.0       | 6.0          | 30.0       | 35.0    | HOLD   |
| MORN| 10.0       | 5.0          | 25.0       | 28.0    | HOLD   |
| TRI | 70.0       | 7.0          | 27.0       | 40.0    | BUY    |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows $2.5B cash, positive working capital of $1.8B, and low debt/equity of 0.4x, bolstered by steady cash flows from subscriptions (85% recurring revenue) [2]. Payout policy targets 40-50% of FCF, with $1.5B in annual buybacks reducing shares by 1-2% YoY [2]. Dividend has grown at 10% CAGR, yielding 0.9% [5]. Financial Strength Rating: High, justified by investment-grade credit (A- rating) and FCF covering debt maturities [3]. Expected share count to decline to 310M by FYE2025 [Assumption: Extrapolated from trends].

### Management & Risks
CEO Douglas Peterson (tenure since 2013) and CFO Ewout Steenbergen (since 2021) provide consistent guidance, with quarterly calls emphasizing transparency on issuance trends [1]. Risks include:
• Regulatory scrutiny on ratings oligopoly, potentially capping pricing power [3].
• Macro slowdown reducing bond issuance volumes by 10-15% in recessions [1].
• Competitive pressure from fintech disruptors in data analytics [6].
• Geopolitical tensions impacting commodity markets and cross-border data flows [3].
• Currency fluctuations, with 30% revenue international [2].
• Integration risks from past M&A like IHS Markit [4].

### Company Description

### Valuation
Target price of $520 derived from 35x multiple on FY2026 EPS estimate of $14.85, a 10% premium to 5-year historical average (32x) and aligned with peer Moody's at 28x, reflecting superior growth [5]. Implies 22% upside from current levels, with downside skew limited by recurring revenue; rating could shift to HOLD if issuance volumes drop >15% YoY.

**HOLD:** Expected to perform in line with benchmark (±10%).

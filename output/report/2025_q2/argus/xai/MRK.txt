### Analyst’s Notes
• Merck reported Q1 2025 worldwide sales of $15.5 billion, a 2% decrease from Q1 2024, but grew 1% excluding foreign exchange impacts, driven by oncology and animal health segments [1].  
• KEYTRUDA sales reached $7.2 billion in Q1 2025, up 4% year-over-year (6% ex-FX), reflecting continued demand in metastatic indications despite competitive pressures [1].  
• WINREVAIR contributed $280 million in Q1 2025 sales following its U.S. launch for pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting early uptake in cardiovascular portfolio [1].  
• Animal Health segment grew 5% to $1.6 billion (10% ex-FX), supported by livestock and companion animal products, offsetting declines in vaccines like GARDASIL, which fell 41% to $1.3 billion due to channel inventory dynamics in China [1].  
• GAAP EPS was $2.01 and non-GAAP EPS $2.22 for Q1 2025, with operating expenses down 3% year-over-year, indicating margin resilience amid R&D investments in Phase 3 trials [1].  
• For Q2 2025, management guidance from Q1 earnings call anticipates full-year sales of $63.4-$64.9 billion, implying Q2 growth acceleration from new launches; however, cross-border volumes may face headwinds from geopolitical factors (Assumption: Based on Q1 trends).  
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on diversified revenue streams and pipeline momentum, though monitor GARDASIL recovery and regulatory updates on subcutaneous KEYTRUDA formulations [1].  

### Investment Thesis
Merck & Co. benefits from secular drivers in oncology and vaccines, with KEYTRUDA anchoring a $25+ billion annual revenue stream by addressing a $100 billion+ global cancer market [2]. The company's focus on immuno-oncology, complemented by value-added services like companion diagnostics, supports sustained double-digit growth in core products. Margin expansion is evident through operating leverage, with non-GAAP gross margins at 80.1% in Q1 2025, enabling robust free cash flow generation of approximately $4.5 billion quarterly [1]. Capital allocation prioritizes R&D (19% of sales), dividends (yield ~2.4%), and share buybacks, with $1.2 billion repurchased in Q1 2025, reducing shares outstanding by 0.5% year-over-year [1].  

Near-term catalysts include Phase 3 data readouts for subcutaneous pembrolizumab and WINREVAIR expansions, potentially unlocking new flows in PAH and adjacent indications. Monetization vectors span consumer payments via established networks and emerging areas like cardiometabolic diseases, with total addressable market for new products estimated at $20 billion by 2030 [3]. Despite macro risks, Merck's high financial strength positions it for accretive M&A, reinforcing long-term EPS growth of 8-10% annually.  

### Recent Developments
• On April 24, 2025, Merck announced Q1 2025 financial results, with total sales of $15.5 billion (down 2% YoY), KEYTRUDA up 4% to $7.2 billion, and WINREVAIR at $280 million; full-year guidance reaffirmed at $63.4-$64.9 billion [1].  
• In March 2025, Merck presented Phase 3 data for subcutaneous pembrolizumab with hyaluronidase alfa at a medical conference, showing non-inferiority to IV formulation, supporting potential FDA submission [4].  
• Regulatory update: FDA approved expanded labeling for WINREVAIR in February 2025 for adults with PAH (WHO Group 1), boosting launch momentum [5].  
• No major M&A announced in Q1 2025, but ongoing share repurchases totaled $1.2 billion, consistent with $10 billion authorization [1].  
• Legal item: Ongoing litigation related to legacy products like SINGULAIR saw no material updates in Q1 2025 filings [6].  

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Merck's revenue is driven by processed transaction volumes in oncology (KEYTRUDA ~45% of sales), cross-border vaccine demand (GARDASIL), and emerging cardiovascular flows (WINREVAIR). Incentives like rebates averaged 15% of U.S. sales in Q1 2025, impacting net pricing but supporting volume growth [1]. Operating leverage from scale yielded a 3% decline in expenses, with R&D at $3.0 billion focused on pipeline. For FY25, EPS bridge includes base growth from KEYTRUDA (+5-7% assumed), offset by GARDASIL headwinds (-10-15%), with net EPS guidance of $8.53-$8.65 non-GAAP [1].  

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | EPS (Non-GAAP) | Operating Margin (%) |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 2022       | 59.3        | 21.7          | 7.48          | 35.2                |
| 2023       | 60.1        | 1.4           | 1.80          | 10.5                |
| 2024       | 62.5        | 4.0           | 8.20          | 32.1                |
| Q1 2025    | 15.5        | -2.0          | 2.22          | 33.4                |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Merck competes in a peer group including Pfizer (PFE, market cap $160B, 1-yr EPS growth -5%, current FY P/E 12.5x, op. margin 25%, rating: HOLD), Eli Lilly (LLY, $800B, 40%, 45x, 35%, BUY), and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY, $100B, -2%, 11x, 22%, HOLD). Merck sits on the growth axis with superior oncology margins but trades at a discount to Lilly on P/E due to patent cliffs. Industry tailwinds from aging populations favor Merck's diversified portfolio over pure-play peers.  

| Peer | Market Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E | Op. Margin (%) | Rating |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| PFE | 160            | -5                 | 12.5          | 25            | HOLD  |
| LLY | 800            | 40                 | 45.0          | 35            | BUY   |
| BMY | 100            | -2                 | 11.0          | 22            | HOLD  |
| MRK | 325            | 8                  | 15.2          | 33            | BUY   |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Merck holds $10.2 billion in cash and equivalents as of Q1 2025 end, with working capital of $15.4 billion and debt-to-equity at 0.7x, reflecting low leverage [1]. Payout policy targets 40-45% of EPS as dividends, with quarterly payments at $0.77 per share (annualized $3.08, yield 2.4%) [8]. Buyback cadence remains steady at $2-3 billion annually, expecting 1% share count reduction in FY25 [1]. Financial Strength Rating: High, justified by consistent FCF (> $15B annually) and investment-grade credit (A+ rating). Dividend has grown 6% CAGR over five years, supported by earnings stability [7].  

### Management & Risks
CEO Robert Davis (tenure since 2021) and CFO Caroline Litchfield (since 2021) provide transparent guidance, with quarterly updates on pipeline milestones [1].  
• Regulatory risks: Potential delays in FDA approvals for pipeline assets like subcutaneous KEYTRUDA, as seen in prior oncology reviews [4].  
• Macro risks: Foreign exchange volatility impacted Q1 2025 sales by 3%, with ongoing exposure to emerging markets [1].  
• Competitive risks: Biosimilar erosion for KEYTRUDA post-2028 patent expiry, pressuring 45% of revenue [2].  
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions from U.S.-China tensions affecting GARDASIL volumes, as evidenced by 40% Q1 decline [1].  
• Litigation risks: Product liability claims on legacy drugs could result in settlements up to $1B annually [6].  

### Company Description
Merck & Co., Inc. operates a global healthcare network with leading brands like KEYTRUDA (immuno-oncology), GARDASIL (HPV vaccine), and WINREVAIR (PAH treatment), spanning human and animal health. With a footprint in over 140 countries, the company focuses on innovative pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and biologics, generating revenue through direct sales, partnerships, and value-added services in oncology, infectious diseases, and cardiometabolic areas.  

### Valuation
Target price of $145 derived from blended multiples (16x FY26 EPS of $9.50) and DCF assuming 8% WACC and 3% terminal growth, compared to peers like Lilly at 45x but historical Merck average of 14x [9]. This implies a 13% upside from current levels, with positive skew from pipeline catalysts. Downside limited to 10% on macro weakness; rating would shift to HOLD if KEYTRUDA growth falls below 5% annually.  

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (+/- 10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-Month Rating: BUY; Five-Year Stance: Positive; Sector Stance: Over-Weight.

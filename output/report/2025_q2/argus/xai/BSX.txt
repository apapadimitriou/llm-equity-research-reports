### Analyst’s Notes
• Q1 2025 earnings reported on April 23, 2025, with adjusted EPS of $0.673, below market expectations of $0.75, reflecting higher R&D spend but solid revenue growth [6]. 
• Net sales for Q1 2025 assumed at $4.0B, up 12% y/y, driven by 15% growth in Cardiovascular segment and 10% in MedSurg; endoscopy and urology showed resilience [Assumption: based on historical patterns].
• Guidance for FY 2025 maintained at 10-12% organic sales growth and adjusted EPS of $2.30-$2.40, with Q2 outlook pointing to continued momentum in electrophysiology and structural heart products [3].
• Acquisition integration of recent deals, such as Axonics, progressing, expected to add $0.05 to EPS in H2 2025 [Assumption: pre-cutoff expectations].
• Margin expansion targeted at 100-150 bps for FY 2025, supported by operating leverage and supply chain efficiencies, though forex headwinds persist [1].
• Share repurchases of $500M executed in Q1, reducing outstanding shares by 0.5% q/q [Assumption: extrapolated from prior trends].

### Investment Thesis
Boston Scientific operates in a $100B+ global medtech market, with key drivers including aging populations, rising chronic disease prevalence, and innovation in minimally invasive procedures [2]. The company's portfolio spans high-growth areas like cardiovascular (60% of revenue), endoscopy, and neuromodulation, positioning it to capture share in electrophysiology (EP) and watchman devices, where market penetration is under 20% [Assumption: market size based on pre-2025 estimates]. Secular tailwinds from healthcare spending, projected at 5% CAGR through 2030, bolster its outlook, with BSX targeting 8-10% annual organic growth.

Margin profile remains robust, with adjusted operating margins at 26% in recent quarters, driven by scale and VAS like remote monitoring services [1]. Free cash flow generation of $1.5B in FY 2024 supports $1B+ annual buybacks, enhancing EPS by 2-3% annually, though no dividends are paid. Near-term catalysts include FDA approvals for next-gen EP catheters and expansion in emerging markets, potentially adding 5% to revenue in FY 2025 [Assumption: catalyst timing].

Overall, BSX's diversified exposure and M&A strategy mitigate risks, offering attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to peers.

• No major M&A or regulatory updates in Q1 2025 filings; prior Axonics acquisition (announced 2024) integration ongoing [2].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include organic growth in Cardiovascular (e.g., stents, valves) and MedSurg (endoscopy, urology), with Q1 2025 showing double-digit increases despite EPS miss [6]. Operating leverage from volume offsets incentive rebates and R&D investments, targeting 100 bps margin expansion. For FY 2025, EPS bridge assumes $0.10 from revenue growth, $0.05 from margins, offset by $0.03 forex [Assumption: bridge components].

| Year/Quarter | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Adj. EPS ($) | Adj. Op. Margin (%) |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| FY 2022     | 12.7       | 7.0           | 1.70       | 24.5               |

BSX sits in the growth quadrant, with higher EPS momentum than MDT but lower margins than EW, trading at a premium to value peers amid innovation focus.

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows $2.5B cash, positive working capital of $3.0B, and debt/equity of 0.5x as of Q4 2024 [1]. No dividends paid; focus on buybacks with $1.2B authorized, executing $500M quarterly [Assumption: Q1 2025 continuation]. Share count trended down 1% y/y in 2024. Financial Strength Rating: Medium-High, justified by low leverage and strong FCF ($1.8B FY 2024) supporting growth investments [2].

### Management & Risks
CEO Mike Mahoney (tenure since 2012) and CFO Dan Brennan provide consistent guidance, with transparent quarterly updates [3]. 
• Regulatory risks: FDA approvals delays for devices like Agent drug-coated balloon could impact 5% of revenue [2]. 
• Macro risks: Healthcare spending slowdowns in recessions, with 2-3% sales sensitivity [1]. 
• Competitive risks: Intensifying rivalry from MDT and ABT in EP market, eroding pricing by 1-2% annually [5]. 
• Geopolitical risks: Supply chain disruptions from trade tensions, affecting 20% of costs [Assumption: based on prior filings]. 
• Forex risks: 40% international revenue exposes to USD strength, trimming EPS by $0.05 in FY 2024 [1].

### Company Description

Its network includes brands like Watchman for stroke prevention and Farapulse for atrial fibrillation treatment, with a footprint in over 130 countries. Product scope covers cardiovascular, rhythm management, endoscopy, urology, and neuromodulation, generating revenue through device sales and value-added services [2].

### Valuation
Target price of $85 derived from 35x FY 2026 EPS estimate of $2.45, a 10% premium to 5-year average P/E of 32x, reflecting peer multiples (e.g., SYK at 30x) and growth outlook [5]. Implies 8% upside from assumed $78.50 close. Upside skew from M&A accretion; downside from regulatory setbacks. Rating would shift to HOLD if EPS growth falls below 10%.

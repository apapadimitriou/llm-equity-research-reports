### Analyst’s Notes
• Goldman Sachs reported Q1 2025 net revenues of $15.06 billion, up 6% y/y, driven by a 10% increase in Global Banking & Markets to $10.71 billion, exceeding estimates of $10.42 billion [1].
• Equities trading revenue reached a record $4.19 billion in Q1 2025, beating expectations of $3.8 billion, amid volatile markets, while FICC trading was $4.40 billion, slightly missing $4.47 billion estimate [2].
• EPS for Q1 2025 was $14.12, significantly above the $11.58 consensus, with annualized ROE of 16.9%, reflecting strong profitability [1].
• Net earnings rose to $4.74 billion in Q1 2025, supported by equities trading gains, though CEO noted challenging environment ahead [3].
• Approved a new up to $40 billion share buyback program, signaling confidence in capital position and commitment to shareholder returns [4].
• Outlook for Q2 2025 includes potential uplift from advisory fees and market volatility, but with caution on macroeconomic headwinds; no formal guidance provided in Q1 release [3].

### Investment Thesis
Goldman Sachs benefits from secular drivers in global capital markets, including increased volatility boosting trading volumes and a rebound in M&A activity amid economic recovery. The firm's diversified revenue streams—spanning investment banking, trading, and asset management—position it to capture growth in addressable markets estimated at over $1 trillion annually in global financial services [5]. With a focus on high-margin businesses like equities trading, which delivered record Q1 2025 results, Goldman maintains strong operating leverage, targeting mid-teens ROE over the medium term.

Margin expansion is supported by cost discipline and reduced provisions, while free cash flow generation enables robust capital returns, including dividends and buybacks. Near-term catalysts include potential IPO resurgence and cross-border deal flow, with Q1 2025 advisory revenues up y/y [1]. The firm's pivot toward stable fee-based revenues in asset management enhances resilience against cyclical trading swings.

Overall, Goldman's market-leading position in equities and banking supports a positive thesis, with EPS growth projected at 8% for 2025 based on strategist estimates, though subject to market conditions [6].

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-04-14, Goldman Sachs released Q1 2025 earnings, reporting net revenues of $15.06 billion (beat estimates by $0.3 billion) and EPS of $14.12 (beat by $2.54), driven by strong equities trading [1].
• Announced approval of a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40 billion, replacing prior program, to support shareholder value [4].
• No major M&A or regulatory updates in Q1 2025 release; firm continues to navigate ongoing probes into consumer lending but reported no material changes [3].
• Equities trading revenue hit record levels in Q1 2025 amid market volatility, outperforming peers like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley in trading gains [7].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers for Goldman Sachs include trading volumes in equities and FICC, investment banking fees from M&A and underwriting, and asset management growth. In Q1 2025, equities trading surged due to volatile markets, while incentives remained stable with operating leverage from cost controls contributing to margin expansion. EPS growth reflects higher revenues offset by modest expense increases; no formal FY25 guidance was issued, but analyst consensus points to mid-single-digit revenue growth.

For FY25, EPS bridge assumes baseline from Q1 strength, with potential Q2 uplift from seasonal deal activity, though cross-border volumes could face geopolitical pressures.

| Year/Quarter | Net Revenues ($B) | EPS ($) | ROE (%) |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| FY2022        | 47.4             | 22.5   | 10.2   |
| FY2023        | 46.3             | 22.9   | 7.5    |
| FY2024        | 50.1             | 25.6   | 8.5    | 
| Q1 2025       | 15.1             | 14.1   | 16.9   |

• Competitive risks from peers like JPMorgan in equities trading and fintech disruptors in payments [7].

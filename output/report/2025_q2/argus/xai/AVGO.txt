### Analyst’s Notes
• Broadcom reported Q2 FY2025 revenue of $15.0B, up 20% YoY, driven by AI products contributing $4.4B, up 46% YoY [1].
• Adjusted EPS reached $1.58, slightly above estimates of $1.56, with EBITDA at approximately 66% margin, reflecting operating leverage from high-margin AI sales [1].
• Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 12% YoY to $8.2B, while infrastructure software rose 35% YoY to $6.8B, bolstered by VMware integration [1].
• Q3 guidance projects revenue of $15.8B, up 21% YoY, with AI revenue expected at $5.1B, signaling sustained demand from hyperscalers [1].
• Cross-border and networking volumes remained robust, with no material changes to incentives; management highlighted custom AI accelerators as a key growth vector [2].
• Thesis update: Maintain positive outlook on AI monetization, though monitoring macro risks in non-AI segments; FY2025 revenue guidance unchanged at $50B+ [1].

### Investment Thesis
Broadcom benefits from secular drivers in AI, data centers, and networking, with its semiconductor portfolio addressing a $1T+ addressable market in compute and connectivity [3]. The company's focus on custom ASICs for AI training and inference, alongside VMware's software synergies, supports high-teens revenue CAGR through 2027. Margins exceed 60% on adjusted EBITDA, driven by scale in high-value products, enabling strong FCF generation of over $18B annually for buybacks and dividends [1].

Capital returns remain aggressive, with $2.10 quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchases reducing outstanding shares by 2-3% yearly [4]. Near-term catalysts include ramping AI chip orders from major clients like Google and Meta, potentially adding $10B+ in incremental revenue by FY2026 [2]. Product pillars—networking, broadband, and wireless—provide diversification, while value-added services like subscription software enhance monetization in new flows such as edge computing.

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-06-05, Broadcom announced Q2 FY2025 results: revenue $15.0B (up 20% YoY), adjusted EPS $1.58, and AI revenue $4.4B (up 46% YoY) [1].
• Management guided Q3 revenue to $15.8B, implying 21% YoY growth, with adjusted EBITDA margin around 66% [1].
• No major M&A announced in Q2; integration of prior VMware acquisition continues to drive software revenue up 35% YoY [1].
• Quarterly dividend maintained at $0.525 per share, payable in June 2025, consistent with prior policy [1].
• No significant regulatory updates; ongoing antitrust scrutiny in AI chip market noted but no actions pre-2025-06-10 [5].

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include AI product volumes, up 46% YoY in Q2, and processed transactions in networking, with cross-border demand stable amid global data center buildouts [1]. Client incentives remain at 5-7% of revenue, offsetting some growth but enabling market share gains [3]. Operating leverage from fixed costs in semiconductors supports margin expansion, with Q2 adjusted EBITDA up 25% YoY [1]. For FY2025, EPS growth bridges from volume (60%), pricing/mix (20%), and efficiency (20%), targeting mid-teens expansion.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($B) | YoY Growth (%) | Adj EPS ($) | Adj EBITDA Margin (%) |
|-------------|-------------:|----------------:|------------:|-----------------------:|
| FY2022     | 33.2        | 20.5           | 10.5       | 62.1                  |
| FY2023     | 35.8        | 7.8            | 11.2       | 63.4                  |
| FY2024     | 42.6        | 19.0           | 13.4       | 64.8                  |
| Q2 FY2025  | 15.0        | 20.0           | 1.6        | 66.0                  |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include NVIDIA (NVDA, mkt cap $3.0T, 1-yr EPS growth 150%, curr FY P/E 60.2, margin 58%, rating BUY), AMD (AMD, mkt cap $250B, 1-yr EPS growth 40%, curr FY P/E 45.1, margin 25%, rating HOLD), Qualcomm (QCOM, mkt cap $200B, 1-yr EPS growth 15%, curr FY P/E 22.4, margin 30%, rating BUY), and Intel (INTC, mkt cap $100B, 1-yr EPS growth -5%, curr FY P/E 18.9, margin 15%, rating SELL). Broadcom sits in the growth quadrant, with superior margins from AI exposure but trading at a discount to NVDA on P/E due to diversified revenue.

| Company | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr (%) | Curr FY P/E | Margin (%) |
|---------|-------------:|----------------:|------------:|-----------:|
| NVDA   | 3000        | 150            | 60.2       | 58        |
| AMD    | 250         | 40             | 45.1       | 25        |
| QCOM   | 200         | 15             | 22.4       | 30        |
| INTC   | 100         | -5             | 18.9       | 15        |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Broadcom holds $12B in cash and equivalents, with working capital of $15B and debt/equity ratio of 1.1, supported by FCF of $18B ttm [4]. Payout policy targets 50% of FCF to dividends, with buybacks absorbing the remainder at $5-7B quarterly. Financial Strength Rating High, justified by low leverage (net debt/EBITDA 1.5x) and consistent cash flow from recurring software revenue [1]. Dividend has grown 15% CAGR over 5 years; share count expected to decline 2% in FY2025 via repurchases [4].

### Management & Risks
CEO Hock Tan has led since 2006, with CFO Kirsten Spears since 2016; transparency high via detailed guidance on AI and software segments [1].
• Regulatory risks from antitrust probes in AI semiconductors, potentially delaying deals [5].
• Macro slowdowns could reduce non-AI spending, impacting 40% of revenue [3].
• Competitive pressures from NVIDIA and AMD in custom chips, eroding market share [6].
• Geopolitical tensions in supply chains, especially Taiwan-based manufacturing [5].
• Currency fluctuations affecting 30% international revenue [4].

### Company Description
Broadcom Inc. designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions globally. Its portfolio includes networking chips, broadband products, wireless connectivity, and enterprise software via brands like VMware. Operating in over 50 countries, the company serves data centers, telecom, and consumer electronics with a focus on AI accelerators and cloud infrastructure.

### Valuation
Target price of $180 derived from 35x forward P/E multiple applied to FY2026 EPS estimate of $5.15, comparable to NVIDIA's 60x but discounted for Broadcom's diversification; historical average P/E is 30x [6]. Implies 10% upside from current levels, with downside skew limited by 60%+ margins. Rating would shift to HOLD on sustained AI revenue miss below 40% growth.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted basis over 12 months.  
HOLD: Expected to perform in line with benchmark (+/- 10%).  
SELL: Expected to underperform by >10%.  
12-month rating BUY; Five-year stance Positive; Sector stance Over-Weight.

### Analyst’s Notes
• Keysight reported Q2 fiscal 2025 revenue of $1.22B, down 12% YoY but above guidance midpoint, driven by resilient demand in communications solutions despite market headwinds [2].  
• Orders grew 1% YoY to $1.25B, marking a return to growth, with commercial communications up 6% on AI-related investments [2].  
• Non-GAAP EPS reached $1.41, exceeding expectations of $1.30, supported by gross margin of 65.1% and operating margin of 23.4% [2].  
• Cross-border and enterprise segments showed strength, with electronic industrial solutions revenue flat YoY at $407M, aided by automotive and semiconductor recovery [2].  
• Full-year FY25 guidance raised to revenue $4.95B–$5.05B and non-GAAP EPS $5.35–$5.55, reflecting improved outlook on gradual market recovery [2].  
• Thesis update: Maintain BUY on robust pipeline in AI data centers and 6G; near-term catalysts include pending acquisitions for expanded offerings [5].  

### Investment Thesis
Keysight Technologies benefits from secular drivers in high-speed connectivity, AI infrastructure, and electrification, positioning it as a key enabler in test and measurement for electronics design and validation. The company's addressable market exceeds $20B, fueled by growth in 5G/6G deployments, AI-driven data centers, and automotive electrification, with AI-related orders contributing to a 6% YoY increase in commercial communications [2]. Product pillars include software-centric solutions like simulation tools and network optimization, which enhance monetization through recurring revenue streams such as value-added services and subscriptions.

Margins remain strong with FY25 non-GAAP operating margin guided at 22–23%, benefiting from operating leverage and cost discipline; free cash flow generation supports capital returns, though no dividend is paid, with $500M in share repurchases authorized [2]. Near-term catalysts include integration of recent acquisitions to bolster AI and cloud capabilities, potentially driving EPS upside. Overall, Keysight's innovation edge and diversified exposure mitigate cyclical risks, supporting mid-teens EPS growth over the next 3–5 years.

### Recent Developments
• On 2025-05-20, Keysight reported Q2 FY25 results with revenue of $1.22B (down 12% YoY), non-GAAP EPS of $1.41 (down 23% YoY), and orders of $1.25B (up 1% YoY); results exceeded guidance [2].  
• Full-year FY25 guidance updated to revenue $4.95B–$5.05B (down 8–6% YoY) and non-GAAP EPS $5.35–$5.55, improved from prior outlook on stronger demand trends [2].  
• No major M&A announced in Q2, but ongoing investments in AI and 6G R&D highlighted; prior acquisitions like ESI Group in 2024 continue to integrate for simulation synergies [5].  
• Regulatory items stable; no material legal updates, though industry faces scrutiny on supply chain geopolitics [2].  
• Capital returns: $100M in share repurchases during Q2, with $1.2B remaining under authorization; no dividend policy change [2].  

### Earnings & Growth Analysis
Revenue drivers include processed transaction volumes in communications (down 17% YoY to $813M in Q2) and steady electronic industrial solutions, offset by reduced client incentives and cross-border headwinds from macro softness [2]. Operating leverage improved with expense growth contained at 5% YoY, yielding EPS upside. For FY25, EPS bridge anticipates volume recovery adding $0.50–$0.70, margin expansion $0.30, offset by $0.20 in higher taxes [Assumption: Based on guidance trends].

| 2022       | 5.42       | 9.5  | 7.25        | 15.2 | 64.8          |
| 2023       | 5.46       | 0.7  | 7.45        | 2.8  | 65.2          |
| 2024       | 5.46       | 0.0  | 6.85        | -8.1 | 64.5          |

### Peer & Industry Analysis
Peers include Agilent Technologies (A, market cap $40.2B, 1-yr EPS growth -5%, current FY P/E 28.3x, op. margin 25%, rating HOLD), Teradyne (TER, $20.1B, 8%, 25.1x, 22%, BUY), and National Instruments (acquired, data not available). Keysight trades at a premium on P/E due to growth in AI/6G, positioning it on the Growth axis versus value peers like Teradyne.

| Company | Mkt Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Gr% | Curr FY P/E | Op Margin % |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| KEYS   | 26.5        | -8          | 24.5       | 23.4       |
| A      | 40.2        | -5          | 28.3       | 25.0       |
| TER    | 20.1        | 8           | 25.1       | 22.0       |

### Financial Strength & Dividend
Balance sheet shows cash of $1.8B, working capital $2.5B, and debt/equity of 0.4x as of Q2 2025, supporting high liquidity [2]. No dividend paid (yield 0%), with focus on buybacks: $100M repurchased in Q2, reducing shares by 0.5% YoY [2]. Financial Strength Rating High, justified by net cash position and FCF of $250M in Q2, enabling reinvestment [2]. Share count expected to trend down modestly at 1–2% annually if buybacks continue [Assumption: Based on authorization trends].

### Management & Risks
CEO Satish Dhanasekaran (tenure since 2022) and CFO Neil Dougherty provide transparent guidance, with Q2 results beating estimates and outlook raised [2].  
• Regulatory: Potential U.S.-China trade tensions impacting semiconductor supply chains [2].  
• Macro: Economic slowdown delaying capex in communications, contributing to 12% revenue decline [2].  
• Competitive: Intensifying rivalry from peers like Rohde & Schwarz in 6G testing [5].  
• Geopolitical: Supply disruptions from Asia-Pacific dependencies [2].  
• Execution: Integration risks from acquisitions amid R&D spend of 15% of revenue [2].  

### Company Description

With a footprint in over 100 countries, its products span communications, aerospace/defense, automotive, and semiconductor markets, focusing on simulation, validation, and optimization to accelerate innovation.

### Valuation
Target price of $180 derived from 28x FY26 EPS estimate of $6.45 (implying 20% premium to 5-year average P/E of 23x), cross-checked with DCF assuming 10% WACC and 3% terminal growth; compares to peer Agilent at 28.3x [4]. Upside skew positive on AI catalysts; downgrade to HOLD if FY25 revenue misses guidance by >5%.

### Ratings Reference
BUY: Expected to outperform broad market benchmark by >10% on risk-adjusted 12-month basis.  
HOLD: Expected in-line performance ±10%.  
SELL: Expected underperformance by >10%.  
12-month rating: BUY; Five-year stance: Positive long-term; Sector stance: Market-Weight.

# The Cigna Group (CI) Research Report

The Cigna Group demonstrates resilient operational execution through Q2 2025 despite facing headwinds from elevated stop-loss medical costs and regulatory pressures. The company's diversified healthcare services model, anchored by the high-growth Evernorth Health Services segment and disciplined capital allocation strategy, positions CI favorably for sustained earnings growth. Recent strategic portfolio optimization through the Medicare business divestiture and robust free cash flow generation support our positive outlook, while the company's raised full-year 2025 guidance to at least $29.60 adjusted EPS reflects management confidence in navigating near-term margin pressures.

## Investment Thesis

The Cigna Group's differentiated healthcare services platform creates sustainable competitive advantages through its integrated Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare segments. The company benefits from secular tailwinds including specialty pharmacy growth, value-based care adoption, and employer demand for comprehensive benefits solutions. Evernorth's specialty pharmacy market continues expanding as new drugs are introduced and biosimilars gain prevalence, driving double-digit revenue growth[1]. The healthcare services business model generates strong margins and cash flows while providing defensive characteristics during economic uncertainty.

CI's disciplined capital allocation framework prioritizes shareholder returns through consistent dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases. The recent 8% dividend increase to $1.51 per share, combined with the expanded $10.3 billion total repurchase authorization, demonstrates management's confidence in sustained cash generation[3]. The strategic divestiture of Medicare businesses allows greater focus on higher-growth, higher-margin opportunities while maintaining pharmacy benefit relationships through Evernorth[16].

Near-term catalysts include continued specialty pharmacy volume growth, operating leverage from technology investments, and potential margin recovery as stop-loss medical cost pressures normalize. The company's local market approach to 2025 pricing should improve risk selection and profitability metrics.

## Recent Developments

• **Q1 2025 Earnings:** Reported adjusted EPS of $6.74 versus $6.35 consensus, with total revenues growing 14% to $65.5 billion[19]

• **Medicare Divestiture Completed:** Successfully closed sale of Medicare Advantage, Part D, and supplemental benefits businesses to HCSC for undisclosed consideration in March 2025[16]

• **Leadership Changes:** Named Brian Evanko as President and Chief Operating Officer, expanding his role from Cigna Healthcare CEO/CFO position[12]

• **Dividend Increase:** Board declared 8% quarterly dividend increase to $1.51 per share, marking continued commitment to shareholder returns[3]

• **Share Repurchases:** Bought back 8.2 million shares for $2.6 billion through May 1, 2025, utilizing expanded $10.3 billion authorization[3][19]

• **Prior Authorization Improvements:** Announced enhanced customer support initiatives including dedicated concierge teams and streamlined physician submission processes[15]

## Earnings & Growth Analysis

Cigna's revenue growth trajectory reflects successful execution across both major business segments, with particular strength in high-margin specialty pharmacy and care services. The Evernorth Health Services segment delivered 16% revenue growth in Q1 2025, driven by specialty pharmacy volume expansion and new client relationships[1]. Cigna Healthcare's 9% revenue growth demonstrates pricing discipline amid medical cost inflation pressures.

The company's adjusted income from operations provides clear visibility into underlying business performance, excluding investment volatility and one-time items. For 2024, adjusted income from operations reached $7.7 billion or $27.33 per share, representing 8.9% growth from the prior year[3]. Management's raised 2025 guidance to at least $29.60 per share implies continued mid-to-high single digit earnings growth despite near-term medical cost headwinds.

Key revenue drivers include prescription volume growth in specialty medications, expansion of existing client relationships, and strategic pricing actions to offset medical trend inflation. The company anticipates operating leverage from technology investments and process improvements to support margin expansion over time.

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Q1 2025 (TTM) |
|--------|------|------|------|---------------|
| Total Revenue ($B) | 575.1 | 657.5 | 247.1 | 914.4 |
| Adjusted EPS | 23.36 | 25.09 | 27.33 | 29.68* |
| ROE (%) | 15.6 | 15.9 | 8.1 | 8.5 |
| Medical Care Ratio (%) | - | 81.3 | 83.2 | 82.2 |

*2025 consensus estimate

## Peer & Industry Analysis

The managed care industry continues consolidating around scale advantages, technological capabilities, and integrated service offerings. CI competes primarily with diversified health services companies rather than traditional insurers, given its substantial pharmacy benefit management and care services operations through Evernorth.

| Company | Market Cap ($B) | 1-Yr EPS Growth (%) | Current FY P/E | Operating Margin (%) | Rating |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| UnitedHealth Group | 520 | 12.5 | 16.2x | 8.1 | Hold |
| CVS Health | 85 | -15.2 | 9.1x | 4.2 | Hold |
| Cigna Group | 81 | 8.6 | 11.3x | 3.1 | Buy |
| Humana | 58 | 5.8 | 13.4x | 2.8 | Hold |
| Elevance Health | 115 | 7.2 | 14.1x | 4.5 | Buy |

CI trades at a discount to traditional managed care peers on forward earnings multiples, reflecting market concerns about medical cost inflation and regulatory pressures. However, the company's diversified revenue streams and cash generation capabilities support premium valuation relative to pure-play insurers. The Evernorth services business provides more predictable, fee-based earnings that merit higher multiple expansion.

## Financial Strength & Dividend

Cigna maintains a solid balance sheet with adequate liquidity to support operations and strategic investments, though debt levels warrant monitoring. As of March 31, 2025, the company held $8.3 billion in cash against $26.5 billion in long-term debt, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio of 33.1%[1]. While elevated compared to the industry average of 22.5%, this leverage primarily reflects acquisitions that have generated strong returns on invested capital.

The company's dividend policy reflects a conservative payout approach with substantial coverage from operating cash flows. The recent 8% increase to $1.51 per share quarterly dividend demonstrates confidence in sustained earnings growth[3]. Based on 2024 adjusted EPS of $27.33, the dividend payout ratio remains modest at approximately 22%, providing significant flexibility for future increases.

Free cash flow generation remains robust, supporting both dividend payments and share repurchases. The company generated $31.6 billion in free cash flow during 2024, providing multiple of dividend coverage[13]. Share count reduction through the expanded $10.3 billion repurchase program should contribute 2-3% annual EPS growth over the medium term.

**Financial Strength Rating: Medium-High** - Strong cash generation and conservative dividend policy offset by elevated debt levels from acquisitions.

## Management & Risks

CEO David Cordani's long tenure provides operational continuity and strategic vision for navigating industry transformation. The recent promotion of Brian Evanko to President and COO positions experienced leadership for succession planning while maintaining focus on healthcare services growth[12]. Management's transparent communication around guidance adjustments and strategic priorities supports investor confidence.

Key risk factors include regulatory scrutiny of pharmacy benefit management practices, potential Medicare Advantage payment reductions, and medical cost inflation pressures. Additional considerations encompass competitive dynamics in employer-sponsored benefits, cyber security threats, and macroeconomic impacts on healthcare utilization patterns.

• **Regulatory Risk:** Increased oversight of PBM practices and potential transparency requirements could impact Evernorth profitability[11]

• **Medical Cost Inflation:** Stop-loss medical costs elevated above historical norms, pressuring margins in healthcare segment[1][19]

• **Competition:** Intensifying competition from integrated healthcare systems and technology-enabled disruptors[8]

• **Debt Service:** Interest expense burden from acquisition-related debt could limit financial flexibility during economic downturns[1]

• **Cyber Security:** Healthcare data breaches pose operational and reputational risks requiring ongoing technology investments[8]

## Company Description

The Cigna Group operates as a global healthcare company providing comprehensive medical, pharmacy, behavioral health, and related services to individuals and organizations. The company serves customers through two primary segments: Cigna Healthcare, which offers health benefits solutions to employer-sponsored, government, and individual markets; and Evernorth Health Services, which provides pharmacy benefit management, specialty pharmacy, care management, and health services to health plans, employers, and healthcare providers. Headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, CI maintains operations across the United States and internationally, serving millions of customers through its integrated healthcare platform.

## Valuation

Our $379.38 target price reflects a blend of discounted cash flow analysis and peer multiple comparisons, implying a 32% upside from current levels. We apply a 12.5x forward earnings multiple to our 2026 EPS estimate of approximately $33.00, representing a modest discount to historical trading ranges given near-term margin pressures. This valuation incorporates DCF assumptions of 8-10% long-term earnings growth supported by specialty pharmacy expansion, operating leverage, and share count reduction.

The target multiple reflects CI's diversified business model trading at a premium to pure-play insurers but discount to integrated healthcare services leaders. Key upside catalysts include margin recovery from stop-loss normalization, Evernorth growth acceleration, and potential strategic transactions. Downside risks to our target include sustained medical cost inflation, regulatory constraints on PBM operations, or broader healthcare policy changes affecting reimbursement rates.

## Ratings Reference

**BUY:** Expected to outperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted 12-month basis, driven by company-specific catalysts and favorable industry dynamics.

**HOLD:** Expected to perform in-line with market returns, balancing positive fundamentals against valuation or execution concerns.

**SELL:** Expected to underperform due to fundamental deterioration, valuation concerns, or adverse industry conditions.

**12-Month Rating:** BUY | **Five-Year Stance:** Positive | **Sector Stance:** Market-Weight

## Investment Thesis

S&P Global operates in attractive, data-intensive markets with significant barriers to entry and recurring revenue characteristics. The company's dominant positions in credit ratings (duopoly with Moody's) and equity indices (S&P 500 franchise) provide defensive moats and pricing power[4]. The successful integration of IHS Markit has created substantial cross-selling opportunities while generating $619 million in cost synergies and $284 million in revenue synergies[2].

The secular shift toward data-driven decision making across financial services creates long-term tailwinds for the Market Intelligence segment, which represents the largest revenue contributor at 34.5% of total revenues[1]. Recent investments in AI capabilities through the ProntoNLP acquisition position the company to capitalize on growing demand for automated insights from unstructured data[18]. The company's subscription-heavy revenue model (55.5% of 2024 revenues) provides predictable cash flows and high switching costs for customers[1].

Near-term catalysts include continued realization of merger synergies, market share gains in private markets data, and monetization of ESG and sustainability data sets. The planned separation of the Mobility division will allow management to focus resources on higher-growth, higher-margin opportunities while potentially unlocking value in the automotive data business[14].

## Recent Developments

• **Q1 2025 earnings:** Revenue increased 8.2% to $3.777B with adjusted EPS of $4.37 beating consensus by $0.16, driven by subscription revenue growth and transaction recovery[14]

• **Executive appointments:** Saugata Saha named president of Market Intelligence and chief enterprise data officer, with Dave Ernsberger and Mark Eramo becoming co-presidents of Commodity Insights[11][13]

• **Strategic acquisition:** Completed acquisition of ProntoNLP in January 2025 to enhance AI-powered analytics capabilities for unstructured financial data processing[18]

• **Portfolio restructuring:** Announced plans to spin off Mobility division into standalone public company within 12-18 months to optimize capital allocation[14]

• **Guidance adjustment:** Lowered 2025 revenue growth guidance to 4-6% from previous 5-7% range due to softer expectations in Ratings and Indices segments[14]

• **Dividend increase:** Raised quarterly dividend for 52nd consecutive year as part of $4.4B total shareholder returns in 2024[2]

## Earnings & Growth Analysis

S&P Global's revenue growth accelerated in 2024 following the successful integration of IHS Markit, with the company achieving 14% organic growth across all divisions[2]. The Market Intelligence segment continues to drive growth as the largest contributor, while the Ratings business benefits from improved issuance volumes and pricing discipline. Operating leverage remains strong with adjusted margins expanding due to successful realization of merger synergies.

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Q1 2025 |
|--------|------|------|------|---------|
| Revenue ($B) | 11.3 | 12.5 | 14.2 | 3.8 |
| Net Income ($B) | 2.6 | 2.6 | 3.9 | 1.1 |
| Adjusted EPS | 10.85 | 12.60 | 15.70 | 4.37 |
| ROE | 8.9% | 7.7% | 11.6% | - |

The company expects 2025 revenue growth of 4-6% with GAAP EPS of $14.60-15.10 and adjusted EPS of $16.75-17.25[14]. Key growth drivers include subscription revenue expansion, cross-selling synergies from the IHS Markit integration, and market share gains in private markets and ESG data. The Ratings segment should benefit from normalized issuance patterns while Indices revenue grows with AUM expansion in passive strategies.

## Peer & Industry Analysis

S&P Global competes in the financial information services industry against specialized players including Moody's (ratings), MSCI (indices), and FactSet (analytics). The company's diversified platform provides competitive advantages through cross-selling opportunities and reduced client concentration risk.

| Company | Market Cap ($B) | P/E (Current FY) | Revenue Growth | Our Rating |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| SPGI | 170.7 | 33.0x | 14% | BUY |
| MCO | 75.2 | 26.9x | 12% | HOLD |
| MSCI | 35.4 | 37.5x | 8% | HOLD |
| FDS | 18.9 | 26.9x | 6% | BUY |

S&P Global trades at a premium to traditional competitors but justifies this valuation through superior growth prospects and market-leading positions[9]. The company's scale advantages and data network effects create sustainable competitive moats, particularly in ratings and indices where switching costs are prohibitive. Recent AI investments position SPGI favorably against emerging fintech competitors in the analytics space.

## Financial Strength & Dividend

S&P Global maintains a strong balance sheet with moderate leverage and substantial free cash flow generation. Total debt of $11.4B represents manageable leverage given the company's stable cash flows and asset-light business model[10]. Working capital requirements are minimal given the subscription-based revenue structure, and the company generates robust cash conversion rates exceeding 90%.

The company has raised dividends for 52 consecutive years, currently paying $3.84 annually with a yield of 0.69%[12]. The payout ratio of 28.7% provides substantial coverage and room for future increases[12]. Share buybacks complement dividend payments as part of a balanced capital return strategy, with the company repurchasing shares opportunistically based on market conditions. Our Financial Strength Rating of Medium-High reflects the stable cash flows, moderate leverage, and strong competitive positions across core business segments.

## Management & Risks

New CEO Martina Cheung brings extensive experience from her previous role leading S&P Global Ratings, providing continuity and deep industry knowledge[11]. The refreshed executive team combines internal promotions with proven track records, minimizing execution risk during the leadership transition. Management maintains transparent communication with quarterly guidance and detailed segment reporting.

Key risks include regulatory scrutiny of credit rating agencies following periodic market stress events, economic sensitivity affecting issuance volumes and subscription renewals, and competitive pressure from technology-enabled new entrants in data analytics[4]. Geopolitical tensions impact the Commodity Insights business through sanctions and supply chain disruptions[3]. Foreign exchange headwinds affect international revenues, while rising interest rates could pressure asset-linked fee revenues. Data privacy regulations present ongoing compliance costs and potential business model constraints across all segments.

## Company Description

S&P Global Inc. provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions across global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. The company operates through five primary divisions: Market Intelligence (data and analytics), Ratings (credit assessments), Commodity Insights (energy and materials data), Indices (benchmarks including S&P 500), and Mobility (automotive data and analytics)[3]. Headquartered in New York with global operations, S&P Global serves institutional investors, corporations, governments, and financial intermediaries through subscription-based and transaction-driven revenue models.

## Valuation

Our $620 target price reflects a forward P/E multiple of 37x applied to estimated 2025 adjusted EPS of $17.00, representing a modest premium to the current 33x multiple. This valuation accounts for the company's defensive market positions, successful merger integration, and growth prospects in data analytics. The target multiple aligns with historical trading ranges during periods of strong execution and margin expansion.

Key comparable Moody's trades at 27x forward earnings, though SPGI's superior diversification and growth profile justify the premium[9]. Upside scenarios include accelerated AI monetization and margin expansion, while downside risks center on economic weakness affecting transaction volumes. Rating changes would require material shifts in competitive positioning or capital allocation strategy.

## Ratings Reference

**BUY:** Expected to outperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months through a combination of capital appreciation and dividend yield.

**HOLD:** Expected to perform in-line with the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months.

**SELL:** Expected to underperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months.

**12-Month Rating:** BUY | **Five-Year Stance:** Positive | **Sector Stance:** Market-Weight

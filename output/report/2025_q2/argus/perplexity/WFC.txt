# Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) - Equity Research Report

Wells Fargo's transformational journey reached a pivotal milestone in June 2025 with the Federal Reserve's removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap that had constrained growth since 2018[11][13]. The bank delivered solid Q2 2025 results with net income of $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.60, representing 12% growth from the prior year period[2][6]. Management's progress on regulatory remediation has accelerated significantly, with twelve consent orders closed since 2019 including six terminated in 2025 alone[9][10][15]. The bank's financial metrics continue to strengthen with return on equity reaching 11.5% in Q1 2025 versus 10.5% in the prior year, while maintaining robust capital levels with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%[1][3]. Wells Fargo has demonstrated disciplined capital allocation through a new $40 billion share repurchase program and consistent dividend payments, having reduced common shares outstanding by 22% since 2019[17][19]. The combination of regulatory progress, operational improvements, and now unrestricted growth potential positions Wells Fargo for enhanced returns and market share expansion in the coming years.

## Analyst's Notes

• Q2 2025 earnings of $1.60 per share exceeded expectations, up 12% year-over-year from $1.33, driven by improved fee income and expense discipline[2][6].

• Federal Reserve lifted $1.95 trillion asset cap on June 3, 2025, removing seven-year growth constraint and enabling loan portfolio expansion[11][13].

• Net interest income guidance maintained at 1-3% growth for 2025 versus 2024, with management expecting stabilization following rate environment pressures[7][8].

• Twelve consent orders closed since 2019 including six terminated in 2025, demonstrating substantial regulatory remediation progress[9][10][15].

• New $40 billion share repurchase program authorized in April 2025, supplementing $0.40 quarterly dividend and 22% share count reduction since 2019[17][19].

• Total revenue of $20.1 billion in Q1 2025 declined 3% year-over-year due to net interest income pressure, partially offset by noninterest income growth[1][3].

## Investment Thesis

Wells Fargo represents a compelling transformation story now entering its next growth phase following the Federal Reserve's asset cap removal. The bank has systematically addressed historical compliance issues while building operational efficiency and returning substantial capital to shareholders. With loan growth no longer constrained by regulatory limitations, Wells Fargo can pursue organic expansion in commercial banking and consumer lending markets where demand fundamentals remain supportive. The bank's diversified revenue streams across consumer banking, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, and wealth management provide stability and cross-selling opportunities.

Management's disciplined approach to expense management, targeting $54.2 billion in noninterest expense for 2025, combined with efficiency initiatives generating $2.4 billion in savings, positions the bank for improved operating leverage as revenues recover[7][8]. The bank's strong capital position with an 11.1% CET1 ratio provides flexibility for both growth investments and continued capital return to shareholders through the new $40 billion repurchase program[1][17].

Key catalysts include accelerating loan growth following asset cap removal, stabilization of net interest income as rate environment normalizes, continued fee income growth from wealth management and investment banking activities, and potential for enhanced returns as regulatory overhang diminishes. The bank's focus on technology investments and operational improvements should drive long-term competitive positioning in an evolving financial services landscape.

## Recent Developments

• Federal Reserve removed $1.95 trillion asset cap on June 3, 2025, determining Wells Fargo met all required conditions for growth restriction removal[11][13].

• Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated 2018 compliance consent order on April 28, 2025, marking the sixth order closed in 2025[10].

• Board authorized new $40 billion common stock repurchase program on April 29, 2025, effective upon completion of current program[17][19].

• Q2 2025 net income reached $5.5 billion ($1.60 per share), representing 12% growth from $4.9 billion ($1.33 per share) in prior year period[2][6].

• Federal Reserve terminated two longstanding consent orders on February 4, 2025, related to legacy mortgage servicing and Wells Fargo Financial business[9].

• Wells Fargo scrapped net zero financed emissions goal by 2050 and interim 2030 targets in March 2025, citing external factors[18].

## Earnings & Growth Analysis

Wells Fargo's earnings trajectory reflects the bank's operational improvements despite net interest income headwinds from the challenging rate environment. Q2 2025 results demonstrated the bank's resilience with net income of $5.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, while Q1 2025 delivered $4.9 billion, representing 6% growth from the prior year period[1][2][3][6]. The bank's ability to grow earnings despite revenue pressures underscores effective expense management and credit discipline.

Revenue dynamics reflect mixed performance with total revenue declining 3% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to $20.1 billion, primarily due to net interest income compression from higher funding costs and lower loan balances[1][3]. However, noninterest income showed resilience with fee-based revenue growth across core businesses, particularly in wealth management where asset-based fees increased 6% year-over-year driven by market valuations[7]. Management expects 2025 net interest income to grow 1-3% from 2024 levels as deposit costs stabilize and loan demand recovers[7][8].

| Metric | Q1 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Net Income ($B) | 4.6 | 5.1 | 4.9 |
| Diluted EPS | 1.20 | 1.43 | 1.39 |
| Total Revenue ($B) | 20.9 | 20.4 | 20.1 |
| ROE | 10.5% | 11.8% | 11.5% |
| ROTCE | 12.3% | 14.2% | 13.6% |

The bank's expense discipline remains a key differentiator with noninterest expense of $13.9 billion in Q1 2025, down 3% year-over-year despite inflationary pressures[1][3]. Management targets approximately $54.2 billion in total noninterest expense for 2025, supported by efficiency initiatives expected to generate $2.4 billion in savings[7][8].

## Peer & Industry Analysis

Wells Fargo operates within the large-cap banking sector alongside peers including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. The bank's current forward 12-month P/E multiple of 12.2x trades at a slight discount to the industry average of 13.1x, reflecting both the regulatory overhang that has now been largely resolved and the market's recognition of the bank's transformation progress[4][15]. Compared to key peers, Wells Fargo trades at a premium to Bank of America's 11.3x forward P/E but below JPMorgan's 13.6x multiple[15].

| Peer | Market Cap | Forward P/E | Rating |
|------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Wells Fargo | $235.9B | 12.2x | BUY |
| JPMorgan Chase | Data n/a | 13.6x | Data n/a |
| Bank of America | Data n/a | 11.3x | Data n/a |

The banking industry faces common challenges from interest rate volatility, credit normalization, and regulatory oversight. However, Wells Fargo's recent asset cap removal provides a unique competitive advantage, enabling loan growth that peers already possess but positioning the bank for accelerated market share gains. The bank's diversified business model across consumer, commercial, and wealth management segments provides stability comparable to larger peers while offering upside potential from operational improvements.

Wells Fargo's return on equity of 11.5% in Q1 2025 demonstrates improved profitability metrics, with management targeting 15% ROTE through efficiency initiatives and growth investments[1][8]. This performance trajectory positions the bank favorably within the peer group as regulatory constraints diminish and operational leverage improves.

## Financial Strength & Dividend

Wells Fargo maintains a robust balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity metrics supporting its Medium-High financial strength rating. The bank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.1% under the Standardized Approach provides substantial capital buffer above regulatory minimums[1][3]. Average deposits of $1.34 trillion in Q1 2025 remained stable compared to prior year levels, while the bank maintained diversified funding sources and strong liquidity management[1][3].

The bank's dividend policy reflects confidence in earnings sustainability and capital generation capacity. Wells Fargo pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, representing a trailing twelve-month yield of 1.91%[12][17][19]. The dividend was increased from $0.35 to $0.40 per share effective in Q2 2024, demonstrating management's commitment to shareholder returns[12]. With a new $40 billion share repurchase program authorized in April 2025, the bank has reduced common shares outstanding by 22% since 2019[17][19].

Working capital management remains effective with the bank maintaining appropriate levels of cash and liquid assets to support operations and regulatory requirements. The balance sheet positioning supports both dividend sustainability and continued buyback execution while providing flexibility for loan growth following asset cap removal.

## Management & Risks

CEO Charlie Scharf, who joined Wells Fargo in 2019, has led the bank's transformation efforts including regulatory remediation, operational efficiency initiatives, and cultural changes[9][13]. Under his leadership, twelve consent orders have been closed since 2019, with six terminated in 2025 alone, demonstrating effective execution of regulatory requirements[9][10][15]. Management transparency has improved with consistent guidance on financial targets and regular updates on remediation progress.

Key risks facing Wells Fargo include regulatory oversight despite recent consent order closures, as remaining orders require continued compliance focus[9][10]. Interest rate volatility presents ongoing challenges for net interest income, particularly if rate environment remains elevated longer than expected[1][3][15]. Credit risk normalization could pressure provision expenses as economic conditions evolve, requiring careful portfolio management[1][3].

Competitive pressures in banking services may limit pricing power and market share expansion opportunities[14]. Operational risk remains elevated given the bank's size and complexity, requiring continued investment in risk management systems and controls[9][10]. Geopolitical uncertainties and regulatory changes under evolving political environments could impact business operations and strategic planning[1].

Technology transformation risks include execution challenges and potential disruption during system upgrades and process changes[14]. Reputational risk from historical issues continues to influence customer and investor perceptions despite operational improvements[9][13].

## Company Description

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company providing banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services through four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth & Investment Management. Based in San Francisco, California, the bank serves approximately 70 million customers and ranks as one of the largest financial institutions in the United States with approximately $1.9 trillion in assets[10][19]. Wells Fargo operates through an extensive network of branches and ATMs across the United States while providing digital banking services and specialized financial solutions to individuals, businesses, and institutional clients globally.

## Valuation

Our $90.00 target price is based on a multiple expansion approach reflecting Wells Fargo's improved operational profile and unrestricted growth potential following asset cap removal. We apply a 14.0x forward P/E multiple to our 2026 estimated earnings per share of approximately $6.43, representing a modest premium to the current industry average of 13.1x given the bank's transformation progress and growth prospects[4][15]. This target multiple reflects convergence toward peer valuations as regulatory overhang diminishes and organic growth accelerates.

The target price represents approximately 8% upside from current levels and reflects our assessment that Wells Fargo's operational improvements and capital efficiency warrant a valuation premium to historical trading ranges. Key upside drivers include loan growth acceleration, net interest income stabilization, and continued efficiency gains. Downside risks to our target include prolonged interest rate pressure, credit deterioration, or regulatory setbacks that could limit multiple expansion.

A move to HOLD would require evidence of execution challenges in post-asset cap growth or material deterioration in credit or operational metrics. Conversely, an upgrade to STRONG BUY would require sustained outperformance and clear evidence of market share gains in core business segments.

## Ratings Reference

**BUY**: Expected to outperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months based on fundamental analysis including financial strength, management quality, and valuation attractiveness.

**HOLD**: Expected to perform in-line with the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months.

**SELL**: Expected to underperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12 months.

**12-month Rating**: BUY  
**Five-year Stance**: Positive  
**Sector Stance**: Over-Weight

Thesis Update: Structural Simplification and Cycle Resilience Drive Upside
As of July 2, 2025, S&P Global (SPGI) presents a compelling investment case defined by a strategic pivot toward portfolio simplification and the inherent resilience of its core "Essential Intelligence" franchise. The definitive catalyst underpinning our constructive thesis is the company's announcement on April 29, 2025, of its intent to separate the S&P Global Mobility division into a standalone public entity. We view this divestiture not merely as a financial engineering exercise, but as a critical strategic refinement that decouples the cyclical, supply-chain-dependent automotive data assets from the high-margin, recurring-revenue financial information services core. This move is expected to structurally elevate the consolidated operating margin profile and reduce capital intensity, warranting a re-rating of the valuation multiple closer to pure-play information services peers.
Fundamentally, S&P Global continues to demonstrate robust operational execution against a complex macroeconomic backdrop. First-quarter 2025 results delivered an 8% year-over-year revenue increase and a 9% expansion in adjusted diluted EPS to $4.37, surpassing consensus expectations. This performance underscores the durability of the Ratings and Market Intelligence segments even as interest rate volatility persists. While the "higher-for-longer" rate environment has historically constrained debt issuance volumes, we are observing a decoupling where refinancing imperatives—the approaching "maturity wall"—are forcing issuers to market regardless of the cost of capital. This dynamic provides a floor for Ratings revenue that the market has arguably underappreciated.
Furthermore, the company’s capital allocation remains exemplary. S&P Global participated aggressively in the record-breaking wave of share repurchases observed across the S&P 500 in Q1 2025, deploying capital counter-cyclically to accrete shareholder value. The balance sheet remains pristine, providing ample capacity for organic reinvestment in high-growth adjacencies such as Private Markets and Energy Transition analytics.
Our Fair Value Estimate of $595 reflects the value unlocking from the Mobility separation and a projected acceleration in free cash flow generation. We believe the current market price discounts the execution risk of the spin-off excessively while overlooking the compounding power of the remaining "New SPGI" entity. We see SPGI as a core holding for quality-focused portfolios, offering a rare combination of defensive characteristics via its benchmarks and offensive exposure to the digitization of global financial markets.
4. Business Description
S&P Global is a preeminent provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Following the transformative merger with IHS Markit, the company has evolved into an integrated information services juggernaut. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company operates through five reportable segments, although this structure is currently in transition due to the planned separation of the Mobility division.
S&P Global Ratings (Ratings)
The Ratings segment serves as the historical bedrock of the enterprise and remains the world's leading provider of independent credit ratings, research, and analytics.
Core Offerings: It provides credit ratings on the debt obligations of corporations, financial institutions, insurance companies, sovereign governments, and structured finance vehicles.
Revenue Model: The model is bifurcated into transaction-based revenue (fees charged for initial ratings on new debt issuance) and non-transaction-based revenue (surveillance fees, annual frequent issuer fees, and subscriptions to research like RatingsDirect®). Transaction revenue is sensitive to issuance volumes, interest rates, and M&A activity, while non-transaction revenue provides a stable, recurring base.
Market Position: It operates in a functional oligopoly alongside Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Together, these entities dominate the global credit rating landscape, protected by regulatory designations (NRSRO in the US) and deep institutional entrenchment.
S&P Global Market Intelligence (Market Intelligence)
This segment is the largest by revenue following the integration of IHS Markit’s financial data assets. It is a premier provider of multi-asset class data, research, and analytical tools.
Core Offerings: Key platforms include S&P Capital IQ Pro, which integrates fundamental financial data with sector-specific metrics; enterprise data solutions (feeds and APIs); and credit risk solutions. This segment also houses the sustainability data business (Sustainable1) and the Private Markets initiatives.
Revenue Model: Primarily subscription-based, characterized by high retention rates (typically above 95% for enterprise customers) and recurring revenue streams. This segment is highly defensive, as financial institutions require these workflows for daily operations regardless of market conditions.
Integration Synergies: The combination of S&P’s legacy fundamental data with IHS Markit’s fixed income, derivatives, and private markets data has created a comprehensive "public-to-private" data ecosystem that few competitors can match.
S&P Dow Jones Indices (Indices)
S&P Dow Jones Indices is the world's largest global resource for index-based concepts, data, and research.
Core Offerings: It maintains iconic financial market indicators, most notably the S&P 500® and the Dow Jones Industrial Average®. It also calculates thousands of other indices across asset classes, including fixed income, commodities, and ESG.
Revenue Model: The segment generates revenue through asset-linked fees (based on Assets Under Management in ETFs and mutual funds tracking its indices) and licensing fees for data and derivatives trading volumes. This business is exceptionally high-margin (often exceeding 60% operating margin) and capital-light.
Growth Driver: It is a primary beneficiary of the secular shift from active to passive investing. As capital flows into passive products, SPGI earns a royalty-like stream with zero incremental cost.
S&P Global Commodity Insights (Commodity Insights)
Formed from the combination of S&P Global Platts and IHS Markit’s energy and natural resources resources, this segment is the leading provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.
Core Offerings: It provides benchmark price assessments (e.g., Dated Brent), data, analytics, and software for energy, petrochemicals, metals, and agriculture. It is pivotal in providing transparency for physical and futures markets.
Revenue Model: Subscription-based for data and analytics, alongside licensing fees for the use of proprietary benchmark prices in contracts and derivatives.
Strategic Relevance: This segment is critical for navigating the global Energy Transition, providing data on carbon markets, hydrogen, and renewables alongside traditional fossil fuels.
S&P Global Mobility (Mobility) – Discontinued Operations / Held for Spin-off
Currently part of the portfolio but slated for separation as announced in April 2025.
Core Offerings: Provides insights into the entire automotive value chain, from product planning to marketing and sales. Includes the widely recognized CARFAX brand (vehicle history reports) and extensive data on vehicle production forecasts and registrations.
Strategic Context: While a high-quality asset with strong margins, its industrial focus differs from the financial-services-centric core of SPGI. Its separation is intended to unlock value by allowing it to trade as a focused automotive technology leader.
5. Business Strategy & Outlook
Strategic Pivot: The Pursuit of Essential Intelligence
S&P Global's overarching strategy is defined by its mission to provide "Essential Intelligence"—data and insights that are indispensable for decision-making in the global capital and commodity markets. Following the integration of IHS Markit, the company has moved to a new phase of strategic refinement. The medium-term strategy for the 2025-2027 period rests on three foundational pillars: Customer Centricity, Innovation (AI & Data), and Disciplined Capital Allocation.
Portfolio Optimization via Mobility Spin-off
The most significant strategic development of 2025 is the decision to separate the Mobility segment. Management's rationale is grounded in the divergence of business models and end-markets. While Mobility is a data-rich business, its client base (OEMs, dealers, insurers) and growth drivers (vehicle production cycles, supply chain complexity) differ materially from the financial institutions and corporate treasuries served by the core SPGI divisions. By separating Mobility, S&P Global aims to:
Streamline Management Focus: Allow the remaining leadership to concentrate exclusively on financial information services and capital market workflows.
Enhance Financial Profile: The "New SPGI" will have a higher recurring revenue mix and higher aggregate operating margins, as the Mobility business, while profitable, typically operates at lower margins than the Indices or Ratings segments.
Unlock Shareholder Value: Historical data suggests that conglomerates often trade at a discount to the sum of their parts. Pure-play information services companies (e.g., MSCI, FactSet) often command higher valuation multiples. The spin-off allows investors to value the automotive asset separately.
Secular Tailwinds and Growth Vectors
Despite cyclical headwinds in the Ratings business due to interest rates, S&P Global is positioned to capitalize on several powerful secular trends:
The Passive Shift: The migration of assets from active to passive management is a structural tailwind that shows no signs of abating. As the owner of the S&P 500, the most tracked index globally, SPGI earns royalty-like revenue on every dollar flowing into these products. The rise of "custom indexing" and thematic ETFs (e.g., AI, infrastructure) further expands the addressable market.
Private Markets Transparency: There is a structural demand for data in opaque private markets. Public markets are shrinking in terms of the number of listed companies, while private capital grows. Market Intelligence is aggressively expanding its coverage of private companies and debt, leveraging the capabilities acquired from IHS Markit (e.g., iLEVEL) to provide transparency where it previously did not exist.
Energy Transition: As the global economy navigates the complex shift from fossil fuels to renewables, volatility in energy markets drives demand for the price assessments and analytics provided by Commodity Insights. The segment is positioning itself as the "currency" for the energy transition, establishing benchmarks for hydrogen, carbon credits, and battery metals.
Generative AI Integration: S&P Global is actively embedding Generative AI across its platforms to enhance searchability and insight generation. Q1 2025 saw the continued rollout of AI-enabled features in Capital IQ Pro, aimed at reducing workflow friction for analysts. By leveraging its proprietary, structured data to train these models (via Kensho), SPGI builds a defensive wall against commoditized Large Language Models.
Medium-Term View
For the remainder of 2025 and into 2026, we expect S&P Global to deliver organic revenue growth in the 6-8% range (excluding Mobility). The Ratings business is expected to recover as the Federal Reserve eventually pivots to rate cuts, unlocking pent-up issuance demand. The "maturity wall"—a significant volume of corporate debt maturing in 2026-2028—will necessitate refinancing, providing a natural floor for issuance volumes. The company’s focus on cost discipline and margin expansion—targeting 50-75 basis points annually—remains a key profit driver.
6. Bulls Say / Bears Say
Bulls Say
Bears Say
Wide Economic Moat: The "Big Three" credit rating agency oligopoly is one of the most durable competitive advantages in modern capitalism. Regulatory barriers (NRSRO status) and the "network effect" of benchmark ratings ensure that S&P Global remains essential to debt capital markets. Issuers have no viable alternative to obtaining a rating if they wish to access deep pools of institutional capital.
Regulatory Risks: The immense power of the rating agencies and index providers attracts constant scrutiny. Changes in global financial regulation, or antitrust actions in the EU or US, could threaten pricing power or market structure. There is perpetual risk of "sovereign cap" regulations or liability changes that could impact the Ratings business model.
Recurring Revenue Machine: Excluding Ratings transaction fees, the majority of SPGI's revenue (Market Intelligence, Indices, Commodity Insights) is subscription-based or asset-linked, providing high visibility and stability during economic downturns. The retention rates in Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights are exceptionally high, often exceeding 95%, creating a compounding annuity-like stream.
Macro Sensitivity: The Ratings segment remains highly sensitive to interest rates and GDP growth. A "hard landing" recession in late 2025 or 2026 could freeze debt issuance, severely impacting the segment's high-margin revenue. Furthermore, a sustained bear market in equities would drag down asset-linked fees in the Indices segment.
Value Unlocking via Spin-off: The separation of Mobility will create a cleaner, higher-growth financial technology company. Historical precedents suggest that streamlined companies often see multiple expansion as the "conglomerate discount" evaporates. The "New SPGI" will be a pure-play financial intelligence powerhouse with higher aggregate margins.
Execution Risk on Separation: Large-scale divestitures are complex and costly. There is a risk of "dis-synergies" (lost shared costs) and management distraction during the 12-18 month separation process announced in April 2025. If the separation incurs higher-than-expected tax leakage or operational friction, the value creation thesis could be eroded.
Capital Allocation: SPGI is a cash flow monster. The company consistently returns capital to shareholders through growing dividends and aggressive share buybacks, enhancing EPS growth even in low-growth revenue environments. The Q1 2025 participation in record buybacks demonstrates management's commitment to supporting the stock.
Valuation: Trading at over 30x trailing earnings, the stock is priced for perfection. Any stumble in the execution of the spin-off, a slowdown in organic growth, or a failure to capture the private markets opportunity could lead to a sharp de-rating. The market is pricing in a "soft landing" and successful execution; any deviation could be punishing.

7. Economic Moat
We assign S&P Global a Wide Economic Moat, derived from Network Effects, Intangible Assets, and Switching Costs. This moat is deemed stable and trending positive with the strategic simplification of the business.
Network Effects (Ratings & Indices)
Ratings: The credit ratings business benefits from a powerful, two-sided network effect. Issuers seek S&P ratings because investors demand them; investors demand them because they provide a standardized, comparable language of credit risk across the vast global bond market. A bond without an S&P (or Moody's) rating is significantly less liquid and excludes a vast universe of institutional mandates (e.g., pension funds that can only hold rated securities). The more issuers that are rated by S&P, the more essential the rating becomes for comparative analysis, creating a virtuous cycle that is nearly impossible for new entrants to break.
Indices: Similarly, the Indices segment benefits from the ubiquity of the S&P 500. It is the de facto benchmark for US equity performance. ETF providers (like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street) and asset managers must license this index to create investable products that clients recognize. Liquidity begets liquidity; because the S&P 500 futures and options markets are the deepest in the world, the index remains the primary hedging tool, reinforcing its dominance.
Intangible Assets (Brand & Regulation)
Brand Trust: S&P Global possesses one of the most trusted brands in finance. The "S&P" prefix confers immediate legitimacy to data and benchmarks. In the commodities market, the "Platts" brand (now part of Commodity Insights) is the standard for price discovery. A "Platts Dated Brent" assessment is the price of oil for millions of contracts. This brand authority is an intangible asset that allows for significant pricing power.
Regulatory Barriers: The credit ratings industry is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) environment in the US, and heavily regulated by ESMA in Europe. These regulatory hurdles create immense barriers to entry. The compliance costs alone act as a deterrent for new entrants, while the regulatory requirement for capital charges to be based on ratings entrenches the incumbents.
Switching Costs (Market Intelligence & Commodities)
Workflow Integration: In the Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights segments, switching costs are substantial. These platforms (e.g., Capital IQ Pro, Platts Dimensions Pro) are deeply embedded in the daily workflows of financial analysts, traders, and risk managers. The data feeds are integrated into proprietary internal models, risk engines, and back-office settlement systems.
Data Stickiness: Switching to a competitor (like Bloomberg or FactSet) would require significant retraining, data migration, and operational risk. Furthermore, the historical data sets possessed by SPGI (e.g., decades of fundamental data, proprietary bond pricing) are non-replicable. This results in retention rates that consistently exceed 90-95%, providing a highly predictable revenue stream.
Moat Trend: Positive
While the separation of Mobility removes a data-rich asset, it concentrates the business around its widest-moat assets (Ratings and Indices). The threat of AI disrupting data provision is real, but SPGI's proprietary data sets serve as a defensive wall. AI models are only as good as the proprietary data they are trained on; SPGI owns the "ground truth" data for credit and commodities, making its datasets even more valuable in an AI-driven world.
8. Fair Value and Profit Drivers
We estimate a Fair Value of $595 per share for S&P Global. Our valuation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model that explicitly incorporates the announced separation of Mobility and the robust Q1 2025 results.
Key Model Assumptions:
Revenue Growth (CAGR 2025-2029): 7.8%
Core Acceleration: We project core revenue growth to accelerate slightly as the Mobility spin-off (assumed completion mid-2026) removes a lower-growth component and allows management to focus capital on high-growth financial verticals.
Ratings: We forecast a 6.5% CAGR. This assumes a normalization of issuance volumes starting in late 2025. The "maturity wall" of corporate debt issued during the low-rate era of 2020-2021 will necessitate refinancing in the 2026-2028 window, driving volumes regardless of rates.
Indices: We forecast 9.0% growth, driven by continued net inflows into passive ETFs and assumed annual market appreciation of roughly 6%. The operating leverage in this segment is significant.
Market Intelligence: Forecasted at 7.0%, driven by the expansion into Private Markets (a double-digit growth vector) and enterprise data solutions.
Commodity Insights: Forecasted at 6.5%, supported by the volatility inherent in the energy transition and the growing demand for carbon and renewables data.
Operating Margins:
We project adjusted operating margins to expand from ~46% in 2024 to 49.0% by 2029.
Portfolio Mix Shift: The primary driver is the spin-off of the Mobility business, which typically operates at margins in the mid-to-high 30s range. Removing this segment mathematically lifts the consolidated margin, as Indices (60%+) and Ratings (55%+) comprise a larger portion of the pie.
Synergies & Efficiency: Continued realization of cost synergies from the IHS Markit integration and the implementation of AI-driven efficiency in data collection (reducing manual data entry costs) will support margin expansion in Market Intelligence.
WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 7.6%
Cost of Equity: 8.2% (Beta of 1.05, Risk-free rate of 4.2% based on 10-year Treasury yields around July 2025 , and an Equity Risk Premium of 5%).
Cost of Debt: 4.5% (Pre-tax). SPGI maintains a pristine balance sheet (A- rating range) allowing it to borrow efficiently even in a tighter rate environment.
Valuation Mechanics:
Our DCF model generates an enterprise value of approximately $195 billion. Adjusting for net debt (approx. $11 billion) and the share count (approx. 308 million shares, adjusted for buybacks), we arrive at an equity value of roughly $595 per share.
Implied Multiples: This valuation implies a forward P/E ratio of roughly 32x our 2026 EPS estimate. While rich relative to the broader market, we believe this premium is justified by the company's superior quality, recurring revenue nature, and defensive characteristics.
EPS Bridge & Profit Drivers:
Volume Recovery: A 10% increase in issuance volumes translates to roughly a 3-4% increase in total EPS due to the high incremental margins in Ratings.
Buybacks: We assume the company continues to reduce share count by approximately 1.5% annually, adding to EPS growth.
Mobility Proceeds: We assume the Mobility separation is a tax-free spin-off to shareholders, but any cash proceeds retained or dividends paid by Mobility to the parent prior to spin would be used for debt reduction or buybacks, further supporting the valuation.
9. Risk & Uncertainty
We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating to S&P Global. While the business quality is exceptionally high, it is not immune to external shocks and macro-volatility.
Macroeconomic Risks
Interest Rate Sensitivity: The Ratings business (approx. 30% of revenue but a higher portion of operating profit) is cyclically sensitive to interest rates. If the Federal Reserve maintains restrictive rates deeper into 2026 or if inflation re-accelerates, issuance volumes could remain suppressed. A "hard landing" recession would likely widen credit spreads, making borrowing expensive and further dampening issuance.
Market Drawdowns: The Indices business is directly exposed to equity market levels. A 20% bear market correction would immediately reduce asset-based fees by a similar magnitude. While hedging volumes might increase, the net impact is typically negative.
Regulatory & Geopolitical Risks
Antitrust & Oversight: As a functional oligopoly, the rating agencies are under constant regulatory scrutiny. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the US SEC maintain strict oversight. Any regulatory shift that encourages competition or caps fees would be a material threat.
ESG Backlash: S&P Global has invested heavily in its Sustainable1 franchise. However, the political environment, particularly in the US, has become polarized regarding ESG. State-level anti-ESG legislation could restrict S&P's ability to sell certain ratings or data products to public pension funds, or lead to reputational damage.
Geopolitical Fragmentation: As the world moves toward multipolarity, cross-border capital flows may slow. Tariffs and trade wars (as noted in recent economic outlooks ) complicate the global supply chains that Commodity Insights tracks, potentially reducing the value of global benchmarks if markets become regionally fragmented.
Operational & Execution Risks
Mobility Spin-off: The separation of a major division is fraught with operational risk. There are complex entanglements in technology infrastructure, shared corporate services (HR, Legal, Finance), and data rights. Delays in the separation (targeting 12-18 months from April 2025) or higher-than-expected dis-synergies could weigh on the stock.
AI Disruption: While we view AI as an enabler, there is a tail risk that Generative AI commoditizes the analysis layer of the stack. If clients can use open-source LLMs to synthesize financial data without needing S&P's expensive proprietary terminals, retention rates in Market Intelligence could suffer.
10. Capital Allocation
We rate S&P Global’s Capital Allocation as Exemplary, reflecting a history of disciplined investment, prudent balance sheet management, and shareholder-friendly returns.
Balance Sheet Strength
SPGI maintains a fortress balance sheet with investment-grade credit ratings. The company typically targets a leverage ratio (Net Debt / EBITDA) of 2.0x to 2.5x. This conservative posture provides resilience during credit cycles and "dry powder" for opportunistic M&A or buybacks. The strong cash conversion (Free Cash Flow consistently exceeding Net Income) allows the company to service debt comfortably.
Shareholder Returns: Buybacks & Dividends
S&P Global is a "Dividend Aristocrat" (historically, via its McGraw-Hill lineage), having raised dividends for over 50 consecutive years. The company targets a dividend payout ratio of roughly 25-35% of adjusted earnings, balancing income for investors with retained earnings for growth.
Buyback Discipline: Management uses share repurchases aggressively to return excess cash. In Q1 2025, amidst a record quarter for S&P 500 buybacks ($293.5 billion total market), S&P Global was an active participant. The company views its own stock as a compelling investment, particularly during periods of issuance-driven weakness.
Spin-off Capital Dynamics: The separation of Mobility is expected to generate a capital event. We anticipate that S&P Global may receive a tax-free dividend from the Mobility entity prior to the spin, which would likely be deployed into a large Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program to neutralize any earnings dilution from the separation.
M&A Discipline
The acquisition of IHS Markit was a defining moment. While the price tag was high ($44 billion), the integration has been executed well, delivering cost synergies ahead of schedule. The decision to divest Mobility shows a commendable discipline—a willingness to prune the portfolio to maximize long-term compounding, rather than empire-building. This "shrink to grow" mentality is a hallmark of superior capital allocation.

12. ESG Risk
Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating: 13.96 (Low Risk)
S&P Global is considered a leader in ESG risk management, consistently ranking in the top quartile of the Financial Services sector.
Material ESG Issues
Human Capital: As a knowledge-based economy firm, retaining top talent (analysts, data scientists) is the single biggest operational risk. SPGI scores highly on human capital development, diversity, and inclusion initiatives.
Data Privacy and Security: Handling sensitive financial data and non-public information creates exposure to cyber risks. A breach could be catastrophic for the brand. The company maintains robust ISO-certified governance structures.
Business Ethics: Given the potential conflicts of interest inherent in the "issuer-pays" ratings model, strict adherence to regulatory walls and ethical standards is paramount. The company has extensive compliance frameworks to manage these conflicts.
Peer Comparison
Compared to peers like Moody's and MSCI, S&P Global generally scores favorably. Its explicit business line dedicated to sustainability (Sustainable1) creates a strong internal incentive to model best practices. The decision to separate the Mobility business may also improve the consolidated ESG profile by reducing indirect exposure to the carbon-intensive automotive supply chain.

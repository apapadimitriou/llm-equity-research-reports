### Analyst Note  
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported strong Q2 2025 results, with adjusted EPS of $2.77 beating expectations and revenue of $23.74 B (up ~5% Y/Y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20surpassed%20second,to)).  Highlights include 6% growth in theMedTech segment ($8.54 B revenue) and outperformance by its blockbuster cancer drug Darzalex ($3.54 B vs $3.38 B expected) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20surpassed%20second,to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  Management raised its 2025 sales guidance to $93.2–93.6 B (from $91–91.8 B) and increased EPS guidance to $10.80–10.90 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=billion%2C%20above%20the%20projected%20%2422,to%20%24200%20million%20from%20%24400)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-wall-street-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-04-15/#:~:text=healthcare%20giant%20reported%20adjusted%20earnings,Cellular%2C%20although%20it%20maintained%20its)).  These results reflect robust demand in oncology and medical devices, offsetting ongoing pricing pressures.  The stock reacted positively, reflecting confidence in J&J’s diverse portfolio and pipeline. 

Going forward, JNJ’s thesis rests on steady cash flows from a diversified healthcare franchise.  The company benefits from durable patents on key drugs (e.g. Darzalex and Stelara) and a broad portfolio of medical devices.  The spin-off of consumer health (2023) simplifies the focus on higher-growth areas.  We forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth over 2025–29, with EPS rising as share buybacks continue and margins improve modestly.  Upside to our fair value (~$170) would come from blockbusters (e.g. new oncology/immunology drugs, pipeline successes like Carvykti) and better-than-expected unit growth.  Key downsides include biosimilar competition (e.g. Stelara), regulatory pricing pressure, or slowdown in elective procedures.  Our updated model uses a ~3-4% revenue CAGR, operating margin ≈34%, and an 8% WACC.  At our estimate, the shares trade roughly in line with intrinsic value.  We initiate our coverage with a neutral stance, emphasizing JNJ’s stable fundamentals and dividend, but noting limited valuation upside absent pipeline surprises (see Fair Value section).  

### Business Description  
Johnson & Johnson is a leading global healthcare company.  It operates primarily in two segments: Innovative Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (and until 2023, Consumer Health, which is now spun off as Kenvue).  Its pharmaceuticals unit (Janssen) sells treatments in areas like oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and infectious disease (e.g. blockbuster Darzalex, Stelara) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  The MedTech division covers orthopaedic/shockwave devices, surgery/vision products, and diagnostics (e.g. DePuy Synthes joints, Ethicon surgical instruments) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20surpassed%20second,to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-lifts-profit-sales-forecasts-beats-wall-street-expectations-2024-10-15/#:~:text=cell%20therapy%20Carvykti%20achieved%20%24286,quarter%20adjusted)).  JNJ markets products in over 175 countries; about 57% of sales are US-based (2024 US sales $50.3 B vs $46.4 B in 2023) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20worldwide%20sales%20increased,changes%20consisted%20of%20the%20following)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=Sales%20by%20U,5%C2%A0billion%20in)).  In 2024, continuing operations revenue grew 4.3% to $88.8 B ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20worldwide%20sales%20increased,changes%20consisted%20of%20the%20following)).  Product sales are driven by a large global sales force and long-standing hospital/physician relationships.  The company holds more than 250+ subsidiaries and is headquartered in New Brunswick, NJ.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
JNJ emphasizes R&D and broad disease coverage to sustain growth.  In pharmaceuticals, the strategy is to invest in high-growth areas (cancer, immunology, rare diseases) and bolster the pipeline through acquisitions.  For example, in late 2024 JNJ acquired Intra-Cellular (schizophrenia drug Caplyta) and Shockwave Medical (cardiovascular devices) to expand its portfolio ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  The company also partners (e.g. with Sandoz for biosimilars) and litigates to protect franchises (filing suit to delay Stelara biosimilars ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-sues-samsung-bioepis-over-contract-breach-stelara-biosimilar-2025-02-24/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20,S))).  In MedTech, JNJ focuses on innovation (surgical robotics, trauma/orthopaedics) while controlling costs.  The 2023 spin-off of consumer brands (Kenvue) allows more focus on higher-value sectors.  

Secular tailwinds include aging populations and higher healthcare spending globally.  These support demand for cancer drugs like Darzalex (20%+ growth) and increasing elective procedure volumes.  However, structural headwinds persist: drug pricing reforms (e.g. US Medicare legislation), currency fluctuations, and intensified competition (biosimilars, generics).  We assume mid-single-digit nominal growth for JNJ’s continuing operations over the medium term.  J&J’s pipeline includes late-stage candidates (e.g. new immunology therapies) that could offset patent expirations (e.g. Stelara’s patent expiry in mid-2020s).  Overall, we expect continued moderate top-line growth and stable margins, with management guiding to ~$91–93 B revenue in 2025 (raised mid-2025) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=billion%2C%20above%20the%20projected%20%2422,to%20%24200%20million%20from%20%24400)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls say:** 1. Diversified portfolio with leading franchises. Top drugs (Darzalex, Stelara) and strong device lines generate stable cash. Darzalex grew ~20% in 2025 and was JNJ’s top-selling drug at $11.67 B in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  2. R&D and pipeline strength: ongoing trials in oncology and oral immunology could add future revenue.  New therapies (e.g. Carvykti CAR-T) show early success.  3. Attractive capital return profile: ~2.9% dividend yield plus buybacks (>5B USD in 2023) support total return.  4. Price hikes and cost control: limited tariff impact ($200M estimated vs $400M prior) bolstered earnings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/johnson-johnson-beats-profit-estimates-strong-darzalex-medtech-sales-2025-07-16/#:~:text=%248,The%20company%20also%20raised)).  5. Solid balance sheet and AAA credit rating provide flexibility.  

**Bears say:** 1. Patent cliffs and generic risk: Key drugs face biosimilar entry (Stelara biosimilars launching in EU/US ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-sues-samsung-bioepis-over-contract-breach-stelara-biosimilar-2025-02-24/#:~:text=unnamed%20private%20label%20provider,Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Alvotech%20launched%20Selarsdi))) which could erode sales.  2. Drug pricing and regulatory pressure: US and EU reforms aim to lower drug costs, potentially reducing pricing power.  3. Litigation risk: Ongoing talc and product liability lawsuits pose contingent liabilities (new talc class action filed in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/jj-hit-with-new-class-action-over-talc-seeking-medical-monitoring-cancer-2024-06-18/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20facing,of%20women%2C%20excluding%20the%2061%2C000))).  4. Slowing device growth: Surgical volumes have rebounded, but competition and US healthcare spending cuts could slow MedTech sales (China/Japan growth was weak in Q3 2024) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-lifts-profit-sales-forecasts-beats-wall-street-expectations-2024-10-15/#:~:text=cell%20therapy%20Carvykti%20achieved%20%24286,quarter%20adjusted)).  5. Mid-single-digit revenue growth may disappoint investors seeking faster growth; valuation could slip if outcomes are worse than expected.  

### Economic Moat  
Johnson & Johnson earns a **wide economic moat** from its strong brands, R&D-driven products, and scale.  Its patent-protected drugs (e.g. Darzalex, Stelara) generate recurring revenues; Darzalex alone accounted for ~$11.7B in 2024 sales ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)).  The company invests heavily in R&D and in-licensing to sustain product leadership.  J&J’s MedTech business also benefits from proprietary technology and entrenched hospital relationships (e.g. hip/knee implants, surgical tools).  Barriers to entry are high: regulatory approval and clinical trials restrict generic competition for many products.  For example, J&J successfully negotiated delays to Stelara biosimilars in the US ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-sues-samsung-bioepis-over-contract-breach-stelara-biosimilar-2025-02-24/#:~:text=unnamed%20private%20label%20provider,S)).  Such actions preserve exclusivity near-term.  These factors have allowed J&J to sustain margins above peers and earn returns on invested capital in the mid-teens (reflecting strong cash returns on its asset base).  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our fair value model assumes moderate growth and stable margins.  We project 2025–29 revenue CAGR ≈4% (reflecting ~3% organic growth plus M&A contributions), rising from $88.8B in 2024 to about $104B by 2029.  Operating margins are assumed at ~34% in 2025, expanding slightly as newer drugs ramp up (versus ~32% in 2022–24).  We use an 8.0% WACC (reflecting J&J’s low beta and solid credit) and a 2% terminal growth rate.  These inputs yield a fair value of ~$170 per share.  (By comparison, our derived multiple is roughly 16× 2025 EPS, in line with large-cap pharma peers.)  

Key profit drivers include new drug adoption and share repurchases.  Adjusted EPS is forecast to grow from ~$5.8 in 2024 to ~$10.8 in 2025 (post spin-off, continuing ops) as operating earnings rise and shares outstanding fall.  We assume JNJ continues modest buybacks (~0.5% of shares annually) and a stable tax rate around 15%.  In summary, fair value assumes a return on invested capital in the mid-teens (reflecting high-margin pharma) and free cash conversion above 20% of sales.  The implied EV/EBITDA of ~12× at our valuation is comparable to historical norms for large diversified healthcare companies.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
JNJ faces a range of risks.  **Macroeconomic:** Global economic slowdown could reduce hospital spending and elective procedures.  Currency fluctuations can bite reported sales (we use a neutral FX assumption).  **Regulatory:** Drug pricing reforms (e.g., US inflation rebates, EU health policies) could compress margins.  The FDA or EU regulators could delay new drugs or expand biosimilars.  **ESG/legal:** High legal exposure from product liability remains uncertain – e.g., J&J continues to contest talc lawsuits and opioid claims ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/jj-hit-with-new-class-action-over-talc-seeking-medical-monitoring-cancer-2024-06-18/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20facing,of%20women%2C%20excluding%20the%2061%2C000)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-sues-samsung-bioepis-over-contract-breach-stelara-biosimilar-2025-02-24/#:~:text=unnamed%20private%20label%20provider,S)).  A negative court ruling could impact cash flow.  **Operational:** Supply-chain disruptions (e.g. raw material shortages) or quality issues could hurt production.  **Health policy:** Changes in healthcare reimbursement or shifts to formularies favoring cheaper alternatives could reduce pricing power.  Any large acquisition (if pursued) carries integration risk.  Overall, we assign **Medium uncertainty** – JNJ is stable, but litigation and patent outcomes introduce notable variability.  

### Capital Allocation  
Johnson & Johnson has a strong financial position and disciplined capital allocation.  The company routinely generates >$18 B free cash flow per year (2022–23 operating cash ~$21–23 B vs capex ~$4–4.5 B) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000013/jnj-20231231.htm#:~:text=Net%20cash%20flows%20from%20operating,711)).  Management uses cash for dividends, buybacks, and selective M&A.  JNJ has a 13-year history of annual dividend increases (2022–24 dividends rose from $4.45 to $4.91) with a current yield ~2.9%.  Share repurchases are modest (about 0.5% of shares annually recently), reflecting prioritization of the dividend.  The balance sheet is solid with an S&P AAA/Stable rating and net debt in line with targets.  In 2024, J&J deployed ~$26 B on the acquisition of drugmaker Intra-Cellular and medical-device vendor Shockwave ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-beats-quarterly-sales-profit-estimates-cancer-drug-sales-2025-01-22/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20Intra,67%20billion%20in%20sales)), indicating a willingness to invest in growth areas.  We rate its capital allocation **A (Excellent)**, reflecting strong returns on capital and prudent financial policy.

### ESG Risk  
J&J’s ESG profile is mixed.  It has low-impact environmental issues relative to industry (expanding use of sustainable materials and renewable energy) but faces significant social/governance controversies.  Notably, product liability risk is high: the company deals with tens of thousands of talc-related lawsuits (now in bankruptcy court) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/jj-hit-with-new-class-action-over-talc-seeking-medical-monitoring-cancer-2024-06-18/#:~:text=Johnson%20%26%20Johnson%20is%20facing,of%20women%2C%20excluding%20the%2061%2C000)) and previously settled risperidone litigation.  These cases create substantial contingent liabilities and reputational risk.  In pharma, J&J adheres to ethical marketing and data transparency, but must guard against compliance lapses in global operations.  Product safety and regulatory compliance remain material issues.  Sustainalytics (2024) places J&J in the *Medium* risk category (score ~ mid-20s).  By comparison, peer drugmakers like Merck and Pfizer typically score in the low-to-medium risk range.  Governance is bolstered by strong oversight (independent board, AAA credit rating) but could be tested by litigation outcomes.  On balance, we view J&J’s sustainability risks as moderate – tail risks from litigation and pharma R&D are offset by responsible corporate governance and industry-leading policies.  

### Appendix  

**Valuation Assumptions:** The model inputs include a WACC of ~8.0%, long-term growth (perpetuity) of 2%, effective tax rate ~15%, and continuing share count ~2.4B. We assume revenue growth of ~4% annually (2024–29) and operating margins gradually rising to ~34–35%. Key multiples at our fair value: P/E ≈16× 2025 EPS, EV/EBIT ≈13×.  

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- **Economic Moat (Wide):** JNJ has durable competitive advantages (brands, patents) that should persist for many years.  
- **Uncertainty (Medium):** Financial forecasts have moderate predictability; known litigation and patent risks create some variance.  
- **Capital Allocation (A/Excellent):** Indicates strong balance sheet and cash flow use (steady dividends, logical M&A, limited debt).

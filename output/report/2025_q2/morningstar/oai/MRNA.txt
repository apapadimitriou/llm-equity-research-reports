### Analyst Note  
Moderna’s core vaccine revenues have collapsed post-pandemic.  In Q2 2025, total sales were only $142 million, down 41% year-over-year ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-quarterly-sales-beat-street-estimates-covid-booster-sales-cost-cuts-2025-08-01/#:~:text=Moderna%20surpassed%20Wall%20Street%20expectations,company%20posted%20an%20adjusted%20quarterly)), reflecting a seasonal trough as COVID-19 demand waned and shifted to future quarters.  The company reported a GAAP loss of $0.8 billion (GAAP EPS –$2.13) ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=and%20GAAP%20EPS%20of%20%24%282)), in line with guidance, and beat consensus on cost reductions. Management reiterated 2025 guidance of $1.5–2.2 billion revenue (cut from previous outlook) and $5.9–6.1 billion operating expenses ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Updates%202025%20projected%20revenue%20range,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202026)).  Balance-sheet strength remains: Moderna had $7.5 billion in cash at Q2 and expects ~$6 billion by year-end ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Improves%202025%20expected%20GAAP%20operating,1%20billion)).  

The recent run of pipeline and regulatory news offsets near-term weakness.  Moderna announced positive Phase 3 efficacy data for its seasonal influenza vaccine, and won U.S. approvals for expanded COVID-19 shots and RSV indications ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20three%20recent%20U,results%20for%20seasonal%20influenza%20vaccine)) ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/view/content/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20reported%20negligible,at%20increased%20risk%20for%20disease)).  Notably, a UK patent court upheld Moderna’s mRNA patent in August 2025 ([www.juve-patent.com](https://www.juve-patent.com/cases/moderna-and-freshfields-win-against-biontech-and-pfizer-at-uk-court-of-appeal/#:~:text=Lord%20Justices%20Richard%20Arnold%2C%20Richard,instance%20judgment)), reinforcing its intellectual property position.  We incorporate these developments into our model: assuming moderate revenue growth as new vaccines launch, we target a fair value ~50 USD per share (implied mid‐teens P/E on 2026‐27 EPS).  At the current price (~26 USD), the stock trades well below our estimate (Price/FVE ~0.5x). Key catalysts in the next 6–12 months include regulatory approvals of RSV/flu products and readouts in the oncology and infectious‐disease pipeline, while continued cost discipline should improve break-even prospects.  

### Business Description  
Moderna is a biotechnology company specializing in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Inc,quarter%20and%20fiscal%20year%202022)).  Its established commercial products are respiratory vaccines: Spikevax (COVID-19 vaccine) and mRESVIA (RSV vaccine for older adults).  In 2024, Moderna generated $3.2 billion in revenue (≈90% from COVID vaccines, $0.025 billion from RSV) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Reports%20full,28)) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Moderna%20is%20entering%202025%20with,approved%20products%2C%20Spikevax%C2%AE%20and%20mRESVIA%C2%AE)).  The company markets globally (U.S., Europe, etc.) through its own sales force and partners.  Beyond vaccines, Moderna has a R&D pipeline spanning infectious diseases (e.g. combination flu/COVID shots, herpes zoster), oncology (personalized cancer vaccines) and rare/genetic diseases (e.g. methylmalonic acidemia) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,our%20pipeline%20with%20financial%20discipline)) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,we%20will%20bring%20to%20patients)).  Moderna also has collaborations (e.g. with Merck on cancer, Vertex on cystic fibrosis).  Its platform is based on lipid-encapsulated mRNA to elicit immune or therapeutic effects.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Moderna’s strategy leverages its mRNA platform to build a portfolio of vaccines and therapies, capitalizing on “first-mover” advantages and manufacturing scale.  The company expects to transition COVID-19 vaccines into a seasonal endemic product and to launch new vaccines over 2025–27.  Recent filings include three Biologics License Applications (next-gen COVID, RSV for 18–59 age, and flu/COVID combo) ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Submitted%20three%20investigational%20mRNA%20products,59%2C%20and%20flu%2FCOVID%20combination%20vaccine)), aligning with management’s goal of “up to 10 product approvals by 2027” ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=,term%20growth)).  These products target large markets: for example, Moderna cites strong consumer demand and a competitive profile in RSV ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20continues%20to,the%20first%20half%20of%202024)), and is pursuing global tenders for COVID boosters.   

Cost discipline has become a focus as pandemic wind-down pressures margins.  Moderna has aggressively cut costs: quarterly operating expenses fell ~40% y/y in Q2 2025 ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3029009/q2-2025-moderna-inc-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=35,reduction%20year%20over%20year)) and full-year 2025 Opex guidance was trimmed ~$400 million to $5.9–6.1 billion ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Improves%202025%20expected%20GAAP%20operating,1%20billion)).  The company plans to reduce annual GAAP operating costs to ~$5 billion by 2027 (from ~$11 b in 2023) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3029009/q2-2025-moderna-inc-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=Moving%20to%20slide%209,annual%20GAAP%20expenses%20in%20two)).  These actions, along with a workforce reduction (~10%), should slow cash burn and improve operating leverage as revenues normalize.  Overall, Moderna aims to trade short-term growth for long-term pipeline value: management is reinvesting in R&D (R&D spend ~40–50% of sales) to sustain future sales.  

Regulatory and market trends are mixed: On one hand, widespread mRNA vaccine adoption (COVID boosters, RSV) and potential new entrants (malaria, autoimmue) support growth.  On the other, competition from other vaccine makers (e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty) is stiff.  However, Moderna’s recent UK patent win confirms a legal advantage in mRNA technology ([www.juve-patent.com](https://www.juve-patent.com/cases/moderna-and-freshfields-win-against-biontech-and-pfizer-at-uk-court-of-appeal/#:~:text=Lord%20Justices%20Richard%20Arnold%2C%20Richard,instance%20judgment)), at least in the near term.  We forecast revenues recovering from 2025 lows as new vaccines launch; achieving scale and margin improvement will be critical to reaching profitability.  

### Bulls Say  
1. **Strong pipeline and approvals.** Moderna’s late-stage pipeline has shown promise: it announced positive Phase 3 flu results and FDA approvals for enhanced COVID and expanded RSV vaccines ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20three%20recent%20U,results%20for%20seasonal%20influenza%20vaccine)) ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/view/content/moderna-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business#:~:text=RSV%3A%20The%20Company%20reported%20negligible,at%20increased%20risk%20for%20disease)). These could drive multi-billion dollar sales in the coming years.  
2. **Platform advantage.** Its mRNA technology is highly versatile. The UK upheld Moderna’s foundational mRNA patent (EP’949), limiting Pfizer/BioNTech’s fallout and reinforcing moat-like IP ([www.juve-patent.com](https://www.juve-patent.com/cases/moderna-and-freshfields-win-against-biontech-and-pfizer-at-uk-court-of-appeal/#:~:text=Lord%20Justices%20Richard%20Arnold%2C%20Richard,instance%20judgment)). This legal victory underscores Moderna’s first-mover advantage in lipid-mRNA manufacturing.  
3. **Cost discipline and cash cushion.** Aggressive cost cuts (40% y/y opex reduction in Q2) and a $6–7.5 billion cash position ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Improves%202025%20expected%20GAAP%20operating,1%20billion)) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3029009/q2-2025-moderna-inc-earnings-call-transcript#:~:text=Vaccine%20business,reduction%20year%20over%20year)) suggest runway to fund R&D without dilution. Analysts note Moderna laid out a $3 b share buyback in 2022 (no dividend yet) – still, excess cash provides optionality.  

### Bears Say  
1. **Falling core sales.** COVID-19 vaccine revenue is plummeting. Q2 COVID sales were only $0.114 billion, far below the $18.4 billion peak in 2021 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-quarterly-sales-beat-street-estimates-covid-booster-sales-cost-cuts-2025-08-01/#:~:text=loss%20of%20%242,2)). With seasonal demand, overall 2025 sales were cut to ~$1.5–2.2 billion ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Updates%202025%20projected%20revenue%20range,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202026)), a fraction of prior levels. If future vaccine uptake disappoints or novel vaccines underperform, growth will be limited.  
2. **High burn and uncertainty.** Despite cuts, Moderna still expects ~$6 billion in 2025 operating costs ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Improves%202025%20expected%20GAAP%20operating,1%20billion)). Net losses will continue into 2025 (EPS consensus ≈–$2.0) and beyond. Many pipeline candidates remain unproven; e.g. Moderna voluntarily withdrew its COVID/flu combo FDA submission in mid-2025 for resubmission ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-quarterly-sales-beat-street-estimates-covid-booster-sales-cost-cuts-2025-08-01/#:~:text=off%2010,RSV%20vaccine%2C%20mRESVIA%2C%20were%20negligible)), illustrating execution risks.  
3. **Competitive pressure.** Other biotech firms are advancing mRNA and alternative vaccines. Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent COVID shot commanded ~50% U.S. market share in 2023 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=COVID,of%20at%20least%20%246%20billion)), and incumbents like GSK/Novavax (flu) compete in adjacent markets. Moderna’s dependence on virtual monopoly pricing is waning, and failure to secure global tenders or achieve economies could compress margins.  

### Economic Moat  
Moderna is generally viewed as having **no wide economic moat** ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/mrna/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=No%20Economic%20Moat)).  Its business is vulnerable to competitive pressure as mRNA technology diffuses.  While Moderna holds key patents (e.g. mRNA vaccine patents), rival firms have similar platforms and the legal protections have limits.  The recent UK appeal decision confirms Moderna’s patent, but litigation is ongoing in Europe ([www.juve-patent.com](https://www.juve-patent.com/cases/moderna-and-freshfields-win-against-biontech-and-pfizer-at-uk-court-of-appeal/#:~:text=Lord%20Justices%20Richard%20Arnold%2C%20Richard,instance%20judgment)).  Intangible assets (know-how, partnerships) provide some edge, but products (vaccines) may face substitute R&D.  As Alpha Spread observes, “Moderna Inc lacks an economic moat” ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/mrna/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=No%20Economic%20Moat)).  We assign **No Moat**, noting patent wins as mitigating factors.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our DCF-based fair-value model uses a 10% WACC and 3% terminal growth. We assume revenues resume growth after 2025 as new vaccines (RSV, flu) and therapeutics launch, reaching multi-billion levels by 2029. For instance, bridging from 2025’s midpoint sales (~$1.8B) to a 2029 revenue of ~$12B implies ~50% CAGR, driven by product approvals.  We model operating margins rising from large negatives in 2024–25 (heavy R&D) toward ~15–20% by 2029 as economies of scale kick in.  On these assumptions, 2026–27 EPS turn positive (we project EPS rising from –$4 in 2025 to ~$3 in 2027).  The resulting equity value per share is roughly $45–55 (using 390 M shares outstanding).  At that fair value, implied 2027 P/E is ~20–25× and EV/2027 sales ~3×. We round our Fair-Value Estimate to ~$50.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include **vaccine uptake & competition**: if government/consumer demand for boosters or RSV shots disappoint, revenues could undershoot forecasts.  Policy shifts (e.g. declining public funding for COVID vaccines) pose demand risk.  **Regulatory setbacks** are material: as noted, Moderna withdrew its combined flu/COVID FDA application in 2025 to reevaluate ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-quarterly-sales-beat-street-estimates-covid-booster-sales-cost-cuts-2025-08-01/#:~:text=off%2010,RSV%20vaccine%2C%20mRESVIA%2C%20were%20negligible)). Negative trial results (e.g. if flu Phase 3 fails primary endpoints) could delay pipeline value.  **Legal & patent battles** add uncertainty: although Moderna won in the UK ([www.juve-patent.com](https://www.juve-patent.com/cases/moderna-and-freshfields-win-against-biontech-and-pfizer-at-uk-court-of-appeal/#:~:text=Lord%20Justices%20Richard%20Arnold%2C%20Richard,instance%20judgment)), final outcomes (e.g. EU Supreme Court hearings) are pending and could affect future profits.  **Operational risks** include manufacturing delays (e.g. filling new EU plants) and supply chain issues. A heavy pipeline workload also means execution risk on many fronts at once.  

Environment/social/governance factors are modest.  Sustainalytics rates Moderna’s overall ESG risk as **Low (19.6)** ([www.knowesg.com](https://www.knowesg.com/esg-ratings/moderna-inc#:~:text=Moderna%2C%20Inc,on%20therapeutic%20areas%20such%20as)).  Notable ESG issues include clinical-trial transparency, equitable vaccine pricing, and environmental impacts of large-scale mRNA manufacturing. These factors could influence stakeholder sentiment but are not likely to swing valuation dramatically relative to core biotech peers.  

### Capital Allocation  
Moderna has prioritized R&D over shareholder payouts. It maintains no dividend and its large cash reservoirs have mostly funded pipeline investment and prior share buybacks.  The company completed a $3 b share repurchase in 2022 but has not consistently repurchased shares since.  With a projected ~$6 b cash end-2025 ([moderna2022rd.q4web.com](https://moderna2022rd.q4web.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Improves%202025%20expected%20GAAP%20operating,1%20billion)) and no debt, the balance sheet is healthy. However, Moderna continues to spend heavily on R&D (e.g. planning ~$4.5 b in 2023 ([investors.modernatx.com](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx#:~:text=Moderna.%20,we%20will%20bring%20to%20patients))).  We rate **Capital Allocation: Poor**, reflecting modest returns of cash to shareholders despite surging profit in 2021–2022.  Large cash piles could fund opportunistic buybacks or M&A, but none have been announced.

### ESG Risk  
According to Sustainalytics, Moderna’s ESG risk is **Low** (score ~19.6) ([www.knowesg.com](https://www.knowesg.com/esg-ratings/moderna-inc#:~:text=Moderna%2C%20Inc,on%20therapeutic%20areas%20such%20as)).  It ranks favorably against industry peers in most categories (e.g. product governance) but scores moderately on environmental factors due to energy/material use in large-scale manufacturing.  A peer comparison shows Moderna’s ESG profile is similar to major pharma/biotech firms (e.g. Pfizer has Moderate ESG risk).  Key issues include equitable vaccine pricing, global access, and the sustainability footprint of mRNA production.  Overall, ESG factors are not a primary driver of Moderna’s valuation given its healthcare focus and strong risk ratings.  

### Appendix  

**Valuation Assumptions:** We assume WACC ~10%, long-term GDP growth ~3%, 390 M shares outstanding.  We estimate full-year 2025 sales ~$1.8B (midpoint of guidance) growing ~50–60% CAGR to 2029 as RSV, influenza, and cancer vaccines ramp up.  Operating margins recover from deep negatives to ~20–25%.  Capital expenditures are ~$0.3–0.4B/year.  These inputs yield ~10% terminal EBITDA yield.  

**Glossary:**  
- *Economic Moat:* A sustainable competitive advantage.  Moderna currently has **no wide moat** ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/mrna/qualitative/block/economic-moat#:~:text=No%20Economic%20Moat)).  
- *Uncertainty Rating:* Analyst estimate variability; we assign **High** due to unpredictable vaccine demand and clinical outcomes.  
- *Capital Allocation:* Quality of management’s capital decisions.  **Poor** indicates limited returns to shareholders (no dividends/buybacks) with most capital spent on R&D.  
- *Free Cash Flow (FCF):* Cash from operations minus capex.  
- *Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):* EBIT*(1-tax)/invested capital, measures profitability of capital.

### Analyst Note  
Eli Lilly enters Q2 2025 with momentum from blockbuster GLP-1 drugs. 4Q24 revenue jumped 45% YoY to $13.53 B (reported EPS $4.88, +102% YoY) driven by Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and new weight-loss Zepbound (Semaglutide) demand ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ca026922525a9e3abb1b75d329628bef#:~:text=below%20Wall%20Street%20expectations%20but,1%20receptor%20agonists%20class)). For 2025 Lilly guided revenue $58–61 B and EPS $22.50–24.00 ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-forecasts-2025-profit-largely-above-estimates-launch-weight-loss-drug-2025-02-06/#:~:text=leading%20diabetes%20drug%20Mounjaro%20in,00%2C%20slightly%20above%20analyst%20expectations)), above consensus. Analysts expect another strong quarter (Q2 sales ~$14.7 B, EPS ~$5.57) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-set-strong-quarter-after-novo-profit-warning-2025-07-29/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20is%20anticipated%20to,Despite%20this)), as Lilly likely gains share in the $150 B obesity market. Indeed, Lilly now holds ~57% of U.S. incretin prescriptions (Mounjaro+Zepbound) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-raises-full-year-earnings-forecasts-surging-demand-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-07/#:~:text=The%20weight,38%20billion%E2%80%94both%20exceeding%20analyst%20expectations)), with Q2 Mounjaro $5.20 B and Zepbound $3.38 B in sales – both above forecasts ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-raises-full-year-earnings-forecasts-surging-demand-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-07/#:~:text=The%20weight,38%20billion%E2%80%94both%20exceeding%20analyst%20expectations)). Pipeline progress is notable: FDA eased Kisunla Alzheimer’s dosing (reducing side-effect risk) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-gradual-dosing-lilly-alzheimers-drug-2025-07-09/#:~:text=The%20U,as%20two%20vials%20monthly%20before)) and EMA recommended its approval ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-regulator-backs-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-after-initial-rejection-2025-07-25/#:~:text=The%20European%20Medicines%20Agency%20,as%20one%20of%20the%20few)). Positive Phase 2 data on heart-disease drug muvalaplin (Lp(a) inhibitor) also emerged ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,daily)). Lilly’s broad portfolio (Trulicity, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance etc.) covers diabetes, oncology, immunology and neuroscience ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,to%20%245.32)). Management is aggressively investing in new capacity (e.g. $3 B Wisconsin plant) and returned capital via a $15 B share buyback and 15% dividend raise ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=County%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20with%20a%20%243,program%20and%2C%20for%20the%20seventh)).  

Against this, recent ORFORGLIPRON trial results disappointed: the oral GLP-1 yielded 12.4% weight loss vs Wegovy’s 14.9% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-weight-loss-pill-helps-patients-shed-124-body-weight-trial-2025-08-07/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20that%20its,loss%20in%20an%20earlier%202021)), causing an ~12–14% stock drop in early August ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-raises-full-year-profit-forecast-weight-loss-drug-strength-2025-08-07/#:~:text=outlook%2C%20Eli%20Lilly%E2%80%99s%20shares%20fell,loss%20over%2068)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-glp-1-pill-cuts-body-weight-by-124-trial-lagging-novos-injection-2025-08-07/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20that%20its,Lilly%E2%80%99s%20stock%20dropped%20about%2014)). Long-term, Lilly faces intense competition from Novo and generic pressure on aging blockbusters. Regulatory scrutiny of drug pricing (e.g. NICE rejecting Kisunla reimbursement ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/lilly-appeal-after-uk-agency-opposes-reimbursement-alzheimers-drug-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20plans%20to,Kisunla%2C%20approved%20in%20the)); U.S. pricing laws) could cap profits. We currently rate Lilly’s fair value around $812, implying ~9% CAGR in revenue (to ≈ 78 B by 2029), stable mid-30% operating margins, and 7–8% WACC. Our thesis: growth drivers (weight-loss/diabetes, oncology, CNS) support premium multiples, but uncertainties around competition and trial outcomes justify a neutral outlook.  

### Business Description  
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company founded in 1876 (incorporated 1901) in Indiana ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company%20,single%20business%20segment%E2%80%94human%20pharmaceutical%20products)). It operates in one segment – human pharmaceuticals – with R&D, manufacturing, and sales worldwide. Lilly’s portfolio spans endocrine/metabolic (e.g. diabetes and obesity drugs), oncology, immunology/dermatology, and neuroscience. In 2023, five products each exceeded $2 B revenue (Trulicity, Mounjaro, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance) and together accounted for 63% of sales; Trulicity+Mounjaro alone were 36% of revenue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)). In 2023 Lilly earned $34.12 B (20% growth), with ~$21.79 B U.S. and $12.33 B international ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=U.S.%20%20,20)). Key new launches include Zepbound (Obesity), Ebglyss (eczema), and Omvoh (Crohn’s). The company also out-licenses products (e.g. sells Jardiance royalty from Boehringer licensing). Most drugs were internally developed; IP exclusivity and scale investors underlie operations ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company%20,single%20business%20segment%E2%80%94human%20pharmaceutical%20products)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)).  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Lilly’s strategy is to fuel growth by maximizing current blockbusters and advancing its pipeline. The company is expanding manufacturing capacity globally (e.g. new sites in NC and Indiana) to meet soaring demand for GLP-1 and other injectables ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-raises-annual-profit-forecast-zepbound-quarterly-sales-cross-1-billion-2024-08-08/#:~:text=significant%20weight,4%20billion)) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=County%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20with%20a%20%243,program%20and%2C%20for%20the%20seventh)). It pursues in-licensing and M&A (e.g. Scorpion Therapeutics acquisition) and explores novel modalities (oral GLP-1s, SERDs for breast cancer, gene therapies). Lilly actively seeks new indications for existing drugs (e.g. Zepbound approved for sleep apnea) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,00)). Management emphasizes innovation: 2024 saw approvals of Alzheimer’s drug Kisunla (pending label changes) and immunology drug Ebglyss, plus strong Phase 3 results (e.g. Zepbound superior to Wegovy ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=Alzheimer%27s%20disease%3B%20,with%20a%20covalent%20BTK%20inhibitor))). Outlook remains positive: weight-loss market growth (est. >$150 B by 2030) provides tailwinds, and Lilly’s share gain vs. Novo suggests continued volume growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-raises-full-year-earnings-forecasts-surging-demand-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-07/#:~:text=The%20weight,38%20billion%E2%80%94both%20exceeding%20analyst%20expectations)). Over the medium term, we expect mid-teens revenue CAGR as pipeline candidates (heart disease, additional cancer drugs) reach market. However, we monitor pricing/reimbursement risks (e.g. US drug-pricing debates, NICE decisions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/lilly-appeal-after-uk-agency-opposes-reimbursement-alzheimers-drug-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20plans%20to,Kisunla%2C%20approved%20in%20the))) and the potential slowing of GLP-1 demand as competition intensifies.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
1. **Bulls:** Lilly’s obesity/diabetes franchises drive exceptional growth. 2024 saw Mounjaro and Zepbound produce $11.54 B and $4.9 B in sales respectively ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ca026922525a9e3abb1b75d329628bef#:~:text=Lilly%27s%20quarterly%20profit%20reached%20%244,due%20to%20additional%20approvals%20and)), with U.S. incretin share ~57% ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-raises-full-year-earnings-forecasts-surging-demand-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-07/#:~:text=The%20weight,38%20billion%E2%80%94both%20exceeding%20analyst%20expectations)). Analysts expect continuing momentum: Q2 2025 sales beat expectations (Mounjaro $5.20 B, Zepbound $3.38 B) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-raises-full-year-earnings-forecasts-surging-demand-weight-loss-drug-2025-08-07/#:~:text=The%20weight,38%20billion%E2%80%94both%20exceeding%20analyst%20expectations)). The pipeline is robust: FDA/EMA approvals for new indications (e.g. Kisunla in Alzheimer’s have expanded the addressable market ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-regulator-backs-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-after-initial-rejection-2025-07-25/#:~:text=The%20European%20Medicines%20Agency%20,as%20one%20of%20the%20few)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-gradual-dosing-lilly-alzheimers-drug-2025-07-09/#:~:text=The%20U,as%20two%20vials%20monthly%20before))), and promising trial data (muvalaplin Phase 2) suggest further peformance ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=,daily)). Lilly’s blockbuster portfolio is defensible: its five largest drugs are leaders in their classes ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)), supported by strong patent positions and manufacturing scale. The company has a solid balance sheet and returns excess cash to shareholders (announced $15 B buyback and raised dividend 15% for the 7th year) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=County%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20with%20a%20%243,program%20and%2C%20for%20the%20seventh)). Lower share valuation now offers upside if execution continues.  
2. **Bears:** Lilly’s valuation is already rich, reflecting future gains that may disappoint. Competition and trial risk loom: the new oral GLP-1 orforglipron produced only 12.4% weight loss (Wegovy achieved 14.9%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-weight-loss-pill-helps-patients-shed-124-body-weight-trial-2025-08-07/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20that%20its,loss%20in%20an%20earlier%202021)), and side effects caused ~14% stock decline in August ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eli-lilly-raises-full-year-profit-forecast-weight-loss-drug-strength-2025-08-07/#:~:text=outlook%2C%20Eli%20Lilly%E2%80%99s%20shares%20fell,loss%20over%2068)). Key products will face patent expirations (e.g. Trulicity in 2031) and pricing pressure. Recent guidance cuts highlight volatility: in Oct 2024 Lilly slashed 2024 EPS guidance from >$16 to ~$13 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/95488719d0d9a4fbb166df4ced097f0b#:~:text=research%2C%20development%2C%20and%20administrative%20expenses,date)) as wholesalers’ destocking and slower demand hit sales. Regulatory/payer challenges add uncertainty: UK health authorities initially balked at covering Lilly’s Alzheimer treatment ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/lilly-appeal-after-uk-agency-opposes-reimbursement-alzheimers-drug-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20plans%20to,Kisunla%2C%20approved%20in%20the)), and U.S. drug pricing reforms threaten margins. In summary, pipeline setbacks, intense drug pricing scrutiny, and concentration in a few products argue caution.  

### Economic Moat  
Lilly’s competitive advantage stems mainly from patents, proprietary technology, and scale. Its leadership in GLP-1 therapies and biologics gives it strong pricing power while exclusivity lasts. For example, five drugs contributed 63% of 2023 revenue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)), reflecting protected positions. After patent expiration, however, Lilly faces rapid generic/biosimilar erosion. The company invests heavily in R&D to replenish the pipeline (10,000 researchers) and extends IP via use/formulation patents. We rate the moat as **Narrow**: it has meaningful patent-based barriers and first-mover advantages, but lacks the extensive switching costs or network effects of some other sectors. This view is supported by Lilly’s dependence on a few blockbusters ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=each%20of%20Trulicity%2C%20Mounjaro%2C%20Verzenio%2C,1%20receptor)) and by the pharmaceutical industry’s fast-follower dynamics once exclusivity ends.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our model assumes Lilly will sustain revenue growth from 46.0 B (2024) to about 78.0 B by 2029 (≈8–10% long-term CAGR). We project Q2–FY productivity levels sustained by broad uptake of GLP-1 drugs and expanding markets (global obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s). We forecast operating margins rising gradually to ~36% (2023 baseline ≈32–34%) due to operating leverage. Key profit drivers include strong volume growth (volume +16% in 2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm#:~:text=U.S.%20%20,20))), modest price increases, and continuing expansion of high-margin new drugs. In our DCF, we use a 7.5% WACC (≈4% risk-free, 5% equity risk premium, β≈0.9) and 2% terminal growth. These assumptions yield an intrinsic value near $812 per share. This implies 2022–29 EPS growing from ~$8.0 to ~$31.8, with FCF turning from ~$0.8 B (2023) to ~$7.5 B (2029) as the large upfront capex of 2023 (=$3.45 B) normalizes. Implied multiples at fair value are roughly P/E 28x on 2025 EPS and EV/EBITDA ~23x, below current trading multiples.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include demand and pricing pressures for key drugs. U.S. and global payers may impose price controls; for instance, Medicare reform could cap reimbursement for branded drugs. Regulatory setbacks are possible – notably, NICE recommended against covering Kisunla for Alzheimer’s ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/lilly-appeal-after-uk-agency-opposes-reimbursement-alzheimers-drug-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20announced%20plans%20to,Kisunla%2C%20approved%20in%20the)). Operational risks include manufacturing hiccups given Lilly’s rapid capacity expansion (new facilities in 2024-25) and a historically lean supply chain. Trial failures are common in pharma: Lilly’s heavy R&D bet means any late-stage failure (e.g. if oral GLP-1 or Alzheimer’s programs disappoint) would hurt forecasts. Macro factors (economic slowdown reducing elective healthcare spending or foreign exchange swings) also inject uncertainty. We assign **High** earnings predictability uncertainty, given dependence on a few high-growth products and the many variables in pharma development.  

### Capital Allocation  
Lilly has a strong balance sheet (net debt modest versus cash flow) and robust cash generation post-2023. It has consistently returned capital: in 2023 it announced a $15 B buyback and raised the dividend by 15% ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=County%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20with%20a%20%243,program%20and%2C%20for%20the%20seventh)). The company also reinvests in growth (industrial capex ~$3–5 B annually) and pursues value-creating deals (e.g. pipeline licensing). Given this discipline and a management track record of prioritizing shareholder returns when free cash emerges, we rate capital allocation as **Strong**. Balance-sheet metrics (leverages <1x EBITDA) support flexibility, and returning ~75–90% of free cash to investors (via buybacks/dividends) has been maintained.

### ESG Risk  
Eli Lilly’s core ESG risks align with pharma industry norms. Environmental goals include a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-esg-report-highlights-progress-towards-sustainability#:~:text=Reduced%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by,20)), and the company reports progress on water and waste reduction initiatives. Socially, access to medicine and pricing equity are material: Lilly has announced measures to improve access to insulins in the U.S. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-esg-report-highlights-progress-towards-sustainability#:~:text=Reduced%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by,20)) amid scrutiny of drug affordability. Supply chain labor and ethics (especially in clinical trials) are managed by global compliance programs. Corporate governance scores are strong, reflecting an independent board and clear compliance controls. Sustainalytics rates Lilly’s ESG risk as *Medium* (score ~25/100) – broadly in line with peers – with research spending and product safety as key issues. Compared to peers like Novo Nordisk or Pfizer (also mid-range scores), Lilly’s recent sustainability actions (e.g. emission reductions, ESG linking of executive pay) are highlights. Overall, principal ESG concerns include drug pricing/policy, patient safety, and supply-chain responsibility, but none are currently outliers in industry context ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-esg-report-highlights-progress-towards-sustainability#:~:text=Reduced%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by,20)) ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-full-q4-2024-financial-results-and-provides-2025#:~:text=County%2C%20Wisconsin%2C%20with%20a%20%243,program%20and%2C%20for%20the%20seventh)).  

### Appendix  
**Fair Value Assumptions:** We use a risk-free rate ≈4%, equity risk premium 5%, beta ~0.90 (WACC ≈7.5%); U.S. tax rate 21%; perpetual revenue growth at 2%; terminal EBITDA margin ≈36%. We assume mid-cycle net debt ≈$20 B. Revenue/EBITDA/FCF reinvestment schedules (see above). Protoype DCF model yields fair value ≈$812.  

**Glossary of Ratings:**  
- *Economic Moat:* Indicates the sustainability of competitive advantage (Wide/Narrow/None). Narrow means IP and brand provide some protection, but no multi-year structural edge.  
- *Uncertainty:* Degree of predictability in cash flows (Low/Medium/High). High uncertainty reflects reliance on product approvals and pricing risk.

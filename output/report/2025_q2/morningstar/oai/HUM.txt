### Analyst Note  
Humana’s Q2 2025 outlook remains supported by its large Medicare Advantage (MA) and government-sponsored book of business.  In late July, Humana raised its 2025 profit forecast to about $17.00 per share, up from a prior guide of $16.25, after reporting a steady medical expense trend (medical cost ratio ~89.7%, near prior-year levels) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-humana-raises-annual-profit-forecast-shares-climb-2025-07-30/#:~:text=reported%20a%20quarterly%20medical%20cost,38)).  This followed stronger-than-expected earnings in recent quarters (Q3 2024 adjusted EPS $4.16 vs $3.40 est ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars)); Q2 2024 $6.96 vs $5.85 ) driven by membership growth and cost discipline.  Management attributes outperformance to gaining MA members and integration of its primary-care network (CenterWell) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars)).  Humana’s pivot away from lower-margin group plans toward core MA and TRICARE (military) accounts is largely complete; the company has announced it will exit employer-sponsored commercial lines to focus on its “core businesses of Medicare Advantage and military service coverage” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-susan-diamond-step-down-cfo-2024-12-03/#:~:text=Humana%27s%20CFO%2C%20Susan%20Diamond%2C%20is,forecast%20due%20to%20disappointing%20Medicare)).  

We maintain a neutral-to-positive view.  The higher guidance suggests Humana has weathered recent cost pressures and may achieve modest profit growth.  Long-term drivers include a booming senior population (over 51% of eligible Americans now enroll in Medicare Advantage ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=Humana%20exceeded%20Wall%20Street%27s%20third,to%20gaining%20more%20Medicare%20Advantage))) and Humana’s vertically integrated care model.  Our thesis rests on stable revenue growth from member enrollment gains and controlled medical costs.  However, we note notable risks: historically volatile MA star ratings and reimbursement rates, as evidenced by 2025’s drop to 25% of members in 4+ star plans (vs. 94% in 2024) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars)), and legacy cost spikes.  We expect fair value near $300, implying a modest upside at current prices (P/FVE ~0.93x).  Humana’s balance sheet is solid and the firm has a history of share repurchases, but management turnover and legal issues (e.g. a 2024 Medicare overbilling settlement of $90M ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=2024,40%2C%20and))) add execution risk.  In summary, we see Humana as fairly valued with potential upside if cost trends remain benign, but remain cautious given regulatory exposure.  

### Business Description  
Humana is a health insurance and services company focused on government-backed plans. Its Retail segment offers Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, and Medicare Supplement products for seniors. The Group & Specialty segment covers Medicaid programs, TRICARE (military) benefits and specialty employer plans.  Humana also owns CenterWell (a primary-care network) and pharmacy services, seeking to integrate care.  In total, Humana serves millions of members: for example, it “insures almost 6 million military personnel and their families,” while providing Medicare Advantage to seniors aged 65+ ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-susan-diamond-step-down-cfo-2024-12-03/#:~:text=Jim%20Rechtin%2C%20earlier%20this%20year,faces%20challenges%20like%20increased%20medical)).  Humana has exited the traditional employer health market, a small slice of its enrollment, to “focus on its core businesses of Medicare Advantage and military service coverage” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-susan-diamond-step-down-cfo-2024-12-03/#:~:text=Humana%27s%20CFO%2C%20Susan%20Diamond%2C%20is,forecast%20due%20to%20disappointing%20Medicare)).  Its largest plans are rated by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services); notably, nearly 50% of Humana’s members are in one major MA plan.  

Regionally, Humana operates nationwide in the U.S., with concentration in states like Florida and Texas for Medicare Advantage, plus a national TRICARE contract covering military beneficiaries.  The health insurer’s product mix is skewed heavily toward Medicare Advantage/MA Rx (through Part D), with a smaller portion from Medicaid managed care and veterans’ programs.  Humana’s revenues come mostly from premium income (captive payments from CMS and other governments), with the rest from cornering medical costs and wellness programs.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
Humana’s competitive edge lies in scale and integrated care.  With over 5 million MA and TRICARE members, Humana leverages provider contracting power to negotiate favorable pricing while building continuity of care through its primary-care clinics (CenterWell) and pharmacy network.  This model allows Humana to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and share in cost savings.  Its strategy of exiting small employer business is designed to improve focus and capital efficiency.  Humana also invests in preventive care (the Green House model for senior housing, clinical analytics) to slow cost growth.  

Secular trends favor Humana’s core: U.S. demographics are shifting toward an older population, and more beneficiaries are choosing Medicare Advantage plans.  In 2023, roughly 51% of eligible seniors enrolled in MA plans ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=Humana%20exceeded%20Wall%20Street%27s%20third,to%20gaining%20more%20Medicare%20Advantage)), a record share, reflecting strong demand for Humana’s services.  Government policy remains a wildcard: recent CMS adjustments to star ratings and payment rates caused volatility, but upcoming Medicare Advantage bid submissions (for 2026) indicate relatively stable premium trends nationally ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=Humana%20exceeded%20Wall%20Street%27s%20third,to%20gaining%20more%20Medicare%20Advantage)). Humana’s new management (CEO Jim Rechtin since 2024) emphasizes discipline.  In the near term, we expect moderate membership growth offset by rising per-member health costs; we forecast mid-single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029.  Over the medium term, we believe Humana can gradually expand operating margins by improving care efficiency and reducing high-cost utilization, yielding modest EPS growth despite price controls.  

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
- **Bulls:** Humana’s scale in Medicare and fixed-government payments provide a predictable business. It gains from favorable demographics (millions of aging baby boomers).  The company’s shift to a care-delivery model (owning clinics/pharmacies) could lower medical usage and boost margins. Recent quarters show Humana exceeding expectations (Q3 2024 profit $4.16 vs $3.40 est ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars))) and the firm raised its 2025 forecast, citing controlled costs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-humana-raises-annual-profit-forecast-shares-climb-2025-07-30/#:~:text=reported%20a%20quarterly%20medical%20cost,38)).  Competitors like Aetna and UnitedHealth have reduced exposure in some markets, which may benefit Humana’s member growth.  Improved Medicare Advantage ratings in 2026 (Humana projects 20% of members in 4+ star plans) could drive higher government bonuses (post-July 2025 data) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-humana-raises-annual-profit-forecast-shares-climb-2025-07-30/#:~:text=reported%20a%20quarterly%20medical%20cost,38)).  Analysts point out Humana’s leading market share in key states and its large TRICARE base as enduring advantages ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-susan-diamond-step-down-cfo-2024-12-03/#:~:text=Jim%20Rechtin%2C%20earlier%20this%20year,faces%20challenges%20like%20increased%20medical)).  

- **Bears:** The business faces significant regulatory and cost risks.  Medicare Advantage payment frameworks can shift – Humana previously cut its 2025 outlook due to new low reimbursement rates ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-first-quarter-profit-estimates-strength-medicare-business-2024-04-24/#:~:text=Health%20insurer%20Humana%20exceeded%20first,entirely%2C%20promising%20more%20specific%20information)).  The company suffered a drastic downgrade of key plan star ratings for 2025, with only 25% of its members in 4+ star plans versus 94% in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars)), threatening future bonus income.  High medical utilization remains a concern: late-2023 data showed surging inpatient admissions in MA pools  ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-07-31/#:~:text=costs%2C%20Humana%20maintained%20its%20full,line%20with%20expectations%20despite%20higher)), forcing Humana to warn of persistently higher costs into 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-07-31/#:~:text=Insurer%20Humana%20revealed%20a%20higher,insurers%2C%20including%20UnitedHealth%2C%20Elevance%2C%20CVS)) .  Competition is intense: larger rivals (UnitedHealth, CVS/Aetna) continue expanding share even under cost headwinds.  Humana’s adjustments (e.g. exiting low-margin employer plans) could slow revenue growth in the near term.  Finally, governance and liability issues pose risks – notably, Humana agreed in 2024 to a $90 million settlement over Medicare overbilling claims ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=2024,40%2C%20and)), highlighting potential compliance lapses.  

### Economic Moat  
Humana’s economic moat is essentially **narrow**. It benefits from scale and high barriers to entry in government-plan contracting. Its know-how in MA product design and care management creates switching costs at the provider level. The company’s integrated care model (CenterWell clinics and in-house pharmacy) offers a modest differentiation advantage. However, regulatory oversight and contract terms level the playing field among major insurers, so Humana’s moat is not wide.  Peer insurers (UnitedHealth, Cigna, Elevance) have similar capabilities. Evidence of any moat is that Humana retains a loyal member base and long-term TRICARE partnership – but recent quality-score volatility ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=2024,5%20stars)) shows those advantages have limits. Overall, Humana’s “moat” derives from its Medicare expertise and provider network, which we view as granting **narrow** moat status.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
We derive a fair value of ~$300 per share under a DCF and comparables approach. Key assumptions: revenue CAGR ≈ 5–6% (2024–2029) driven by membership gains in MA and TRICARE; operating (EBIT) margins rising slowly from ~5% toward ~6% as medical costs stabilize and administrative efficiency improves; tax rate ~18%.  We use a 7.5% discount rate (WACC post-tax) and 2.5% terminal growth.  In our EPS bridge, we start from an estimated $16.2 EPS in 2024, reaching ~$22.0 by 2029 (implying ~6% annual EPS growth). Price drivers are incremental premium revenue and flat-to-improving margins: each 1% increase in membership or price boosts EPS by 1–2%. Our model yields an FY2026 P/E around 16x at fair value, below peers like UnitedHealth (~18x historical) due to higher uncertainty.  

We forecast FY2025 revenue ~$110B (after assumed modest share sell-off is complete), rising to ~$135B by 2029. Operating income is projected to grow from ~$5B in 2024 to ~$8B in 2029, reflecting slight margin expansion and underwriting leverage. Free cash flow (operating cash minus capex) is expected to trend upward from ~$4B in 2024 to ~$6B by 2029.  These cash flows support an ROIC climbing from ~7.5% today to roughly 9–10% by decade’s end.  Using these streams and conservative multiples (P/FCF ~8–10x, EV/EBITDA ~9x), we cross-check a per-share fair price near $300, aligning with our DCF.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Key risks include health-cost inflation and regulatory shifts. Reimbursement policy is the chief uncertainty: CMS may tighten plan payments or measure quality differently, impacting profits dramatically (as seen in 2024–25). A sustained jump in medical utilization (post-pandemic catch-up care) could force loss of guidance (Humana pulled its 2025 guide entirely in early 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-says-members-its-highly-rated-medicare-advantage-plans-fell-2025-2024-10-02/#:~:text=Humana%27s%20shares%20dropped%20by%2015,in%202024%2C%20due%20to%20stringent))). Macroeconomic weakness could lower MA enrollment if seniors delay supplemental coverage, though demographics are a tailwind.  Competition risk is high – aggressive pricing by rivals could erode Humana’s market share.  Potential legal and compliance issues add further risk: for instance, ongoing lawsuits and settlements (like the $90M case) pose contingent liabilities.  ESG-related uncertainties include data privacy (health records), drug pricing scrutiny, and demographic health trends (e.g. widespread chronic diseases raising costs).  Conversely, successful cost-control initiatives or favorable legislative changes could swing valuation positively.  

### Capital Allocation  
Humana’s capital allocation is **standard**. The company has a history of returning capital through share buybacks and dividends, but also makes strategic acquisitions (healthcare service providers) to build scale. For example, Humana invested in primary care clinics and pharmacy services (CenterWell) to improve care integration. Free cash flow (~$4B in 2024) has funded both buybacks and debt reduction – Humana’s net debt is moderate relative to equity.  The CFO change in 2025 signaled continuity rather than a strategy shift; management intends to maintain investment-grade leverage while supporting shareholder returns. Dividend yield is modest (~1%) with a prudent payout ratio. We see no reckless M&A; the company abandoned employer plans rather than write down big acquisitions. Overall, capital discipline appears satisfactory and in line with industry norms (hence “Standard” rating).

### ESG Risk  
Humana’s Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating is **Medium**.  Key environmental issues are minimal (health insurers have low direct emissions).  Social issues focus on access to care and data privacy; Humana has been criticized only modestly on these dimensions.  Governance risks include prior compliance events – notably, a 2024 settlement over alleged Medicare Part D overcharges ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=2024,40%2C%20and)) – which dampens its governance score.  Compared to peers, Humana’s social risk is similar to UnitedHealth and Cigna.  Material ESG factors include regulatory compliance, drug pricing pressure, and responsible underwriting for vulnerable populations.  A peer comparison shows Humana’s ESG profile is in line with the Health Insurance industry average (most large insurers fall in the “medium risk” category).  Ongoing oversight of billing practices and quality metrics will be key ESG considerations for Humana’s valuation.  

*Key ESG controversies:* In 2024 Humana settled a whistleblower suit for $90M, the first major U.S. health insurer to do so, resolving allegations of mischaracterized drug costs with CMS ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/humana-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-2024-10-30/#:~:text=2024,40%2C%20and)). No major environmental fines or product safety issues have been reported.  

### Appendix – Key assumptions & definitions  
- **Revenue CAGR 2024–29:** ~5.5% (assumes steady Medicare member growth)  
- **Medical Cost Trend:** ~6% annually (v. premiums)  
- **Operating Margin:** rising to ~6% by 2029 (due to cost control/efficiency)  
- **Discount Rate (WACC):** ~7.5% (post-tax)  
- **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5% (long-term GDP plus)  
- **US Large-Cap Core:** Stocks in the large capitalization quintile with neutrality between value/growth measures.  
- **Economic Moat:** Narrow (Humana’s competitive edge is from scale and government partnership; not protected by patents or network effects strong enough for a wide moat.)  
- **Moat Uncertainty:** High (profitability heavily depends on regulatory factors and cost management.)  
- **Capital Allocation Rating (Standard):** Management has used free cash flow for dividends and buybacks at typical levels; some acquisitions are aimed at strategic growth but funding is carefully managed.  
- **ESG Risk Categories:** Sustainalytics scores (0–10 Low, 10–20 Medium, >20 High risk). Humana falls in the Medium (approx. 20–25 range) category in recent assessments.

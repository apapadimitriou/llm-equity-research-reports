### Analyst Note  
BlackRock posted record AUM of $12.53 trillion in Q2 2025, up from $10.65 trillion a year earlier ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=In%20Q2%202025%2C%20BlackRock%27s%20assets,organic)). Strong markets (equity rally) and secular inflows drove base fee revenue higher (organic growth ~6%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=significant%20rise%20from%20%2410,66%20billion%20in%20outflows)). Total revenue was $5.42 billion with adjusted net profit of $1.88 billion ($12.05/share) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=revenue%20by%202030,However%2C%20performance%20fees%20declined)). Private markets and technology are key focus areas – Q2 saw $6.82 billion into alternatives and “tech” revenue jumped 26% to $499 million ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=from%20a%20%24171,42%20billion%2C%20while)). This offset declines in performance fees ($94 million, –43% y/y ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20data%20provider%20Preqin,However%2C%20performance%20fees%20declined))) and fixed income outflows ($4.66B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=base%20fee%20growth%20for%20the,The%20firm%20benefitted))). CEO Fink highlights client caution amid tariff and deficit concerns ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrocks-fink-sees-trillions-dollars-idle-volatility-persists-2025-05-13/#:~:text=At%20the%20Saudi,deficits%20and%20volatility%20linked%20to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrock-eyes-shorter-term-bets-amid-shaky-global-economic-foundations-2025-07-01/#:~:text=BlackRock%20Investment%20Institute%20,tariffs%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%E2%80%99s)), but notes positive positioning in U.S. equities and broader markets. We maintain that BlackRock’s diversified fee-base (ETFs, active, alternatives) and scale support mid-single-digit EPS growth, though fees remain sensitive to market swings. Growth in high-margin alternatives and AI-driven services (e.g. Aladdin) underpins margins, supporting our stable outlook. We continue to view BlackRock around fair value, balancing robust core business against macro/regulatory uncertainties.  

### Business Description  
BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with ~$12.5 trillion in AUM as of Q2 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=In%20Q2%202025%2C%20BlackRock%27s%20assets,organic)). It provides global investment management and risk analytics services to institutional, retail and wealth clients. Products include exchange-traded funds (iShares), mutual funds, fixed-income instruments, and higher-fee alternatives (private equity, infrastructure, credit). The firm also offers the Aladdin risk platform and data services. BlackRock operates globally, with strong U.S. presence and ~43% share of Europe’s ETF market ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-bets-consumer-push-it-chases-european-savers-2025-03-20/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,funds%2C%20the%20company%20hopes%20to)). In FY2024 BlackRock reported ~$20.41 billion revenue, driven by about $15.49 billion in advisory and admin fees ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Investment%20advisory%20and%20administration%20fees,13%2C724)), plus performance fees and technology services. Net income grew to $6.37 billion in 2024 ([ir.blackrock.com](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/BlackRock-Reports-Full-Year-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-42.01-or-43.61-as-Adjusted-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Diluted-EPS-of-10.63-or-11.93-as-Adjusted/default.aspx#:~:text=Net%20income,390)) (GAAP) reflecting its scale and broad distribution.  

### Business Strategy & Outlook  
BlackRock’s strategy is to leverage its scale and technology to capture growth in passive funds, alternatives, and analytics. It is aggressively expanding private markets: in 2024-25 it acquired HPS Credit, Global Infrastructure Partners and Preqin (~$25B total) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-assets-hit-record-116-trillion-fourth-quarter-2024-2025-01-15/#:~:text=%28ETFs%29,in)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=from%20a%20%24171,42%20billion%2C%20while)), aiming to shift ~30% of revenue to alternatives and tech by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=from%20a%20%24171,42%20billion%2C%20while)). The firm also integrates private assets into core products (e.g. target-date retirement funds with 5–20% private allocations by 2026 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrock-looks-expand-private-markets-retirement-plans-2025-06-26/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20asset,are%20a%20core%20focus%20for))) and launched blended public/private model portfolios ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-launches-new-model-portfolio-further-private-market-push-2025-03-26/#:~:text=BlackRock%20has%20introduced%20its%20first,of%20stocks%20and%20bonds%2C%20BlackRock)). BlackRock is improving its tech/AI capabilities – COO Goldstein noted enhancing Aladdin and data analytics ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/blackrock-coo-looking-improve-tech-ai-capabilities-2024-12-10/#:~:text=BlackRock%20Inc%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest,trillion%20in%20assets%2C%20has%20made)), and the company is hiring AI engineers overseas ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-plans-hire-1200-people-india-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-02-05/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest%20asset,of%20data%20provider%20Preqin%2C%20BlackRock)). It continues to defend and grow its iShares ETF leadership globally ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-bets-consumer-push-it-chases-european-savers-2025-03-20/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,funds%2C%20the%20company%20hopes%20to)). Economically, BlackRock expects continued equity upside (notably in AI/tech) but is cautious on inflation and trade uncertainty ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/blackrock-bets-ai-driven-stocks-rally-us-debt-clouds-2025-outlook-2024-12-04/#:~:text=BlackRock%20anticipates%20that%20the%20AI,to%20persistent%20inflation%2C%20which%20remains)). Its Investment Institute favors U.S. stocks and short-term bonds now, reflecting macro risks ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrock-eyes-shorter-term-bets-amid-shaky-global-economic-foundations-2025-07-01/#:~:text=BlackRock%20Investment%20Institute%20,tariffs%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%E2%80%99s)). Over the medium term, we see consistent base fee growth (fed by modest AUM gains) tempered by volatile performance fees, leading to mid-single-digit revenue CAGR.   

### Bulls Say / Bears Say  
**Bulls Say:**  
1. *Scale and distribution:* BlackRock is massive (record $12.53T AUM ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=In%20Q2%202025%2C%20BlackRock%27s%20assets,organic))) with leading ETF market shares (iShares ~43% in Europe ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-bets-consumer-push-it-chases-european-savers-2025-03-20/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,funds%2C%20the%20company%20hopes%20to))), enabling cost advantages and sticky fees.  
2. *Diversified, growing fee base:* High recurring base fees and a secular shift toward passive and alternative investing provide stable income. BlackRock’s private-market push (inflows $6.82B in Q2) and Aladdin platform (~26% tech revenue growth) promise higher-margin growth ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=from%20a%20%24171,42%20billion%2C%20while)).  
3. *Proven performance:* Consistent net inflows (e.g. $83B in Q1 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-profit-falls-declining-fee-income-2025-04-11/#:~:text=announcements%20led%20to%20a%204.6,due%20to%20economic%20uncertainty%2C%20comparing))) and robust equity markets drive profit expansion. Fink’s teams foresee continued AI/tech-driven equity rallies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/blackrock-bets-ai-driven-stocks-rally-us-debt-clouds-2025-outlook-2024-12-04/#:~:text=BlackRock%20anticipates%20that%20the%20AI,to%20persistent%20inflation%2C%20which%20remains)), boosting asset values and fees.  
4. *Capital returns:* The firm has a track record of disciplined capital allocation, using cash to buy back shares and fund accretive acquisitions, which supports shareholder returns.  

**Bears Say:**  
1. *Market sensitivity:* BlackRock’s earnings rise and fall with markets. Over recent quarters, performance fees plunged (–42.7% in Q2’25 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=acquisition%20of%20data%20provider%20Preqin,However%2C%20performance%20fees%20declined))) and fixed-income outflows ($4.66B ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=base%20fee%20growth%20for%20the,The%20firm%20benefitted))) cut revenue. A market downturn or persistent volatility (e.g. from trade wars or inflation) could sharply hurt fees.  
2. *Fee pressure and competition:* Asset management is competitive. Low-cost peers (e.g. Vanguard) keep a lid on fees. BlackRock saw ETF share losses in Europe to rivals like Vanguard and Amundi ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-bets-consumer-push-it-chases-european-savers-2025-03-20/#:~:text=low,a%20cultural%20shift%20towards%20investing)). Any shift away from its funds (in flat/negative markets) would reduce income.  
3. *Regulatory/ESG headwinds:* BlackRock faces political risk over ESG stands ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tennessee-attorney-general-settles-esg-dispute-with-blackrock-2025-01-17/#:~:text=Tennessee%20Attorney%20General%20Jonathan%20Skrmetti,BlackRock%27s%20CEO%20Larry%20Fink%20had)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-pauses-corporate-meetings-wake-new-esg-rules-2025-02-18/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,to%20pause%20meetings%20was%20reported)). New SEC proxy rules have even caused pause in company engagements. Ongoing litigation (e.g. state lawsuits on ESG policies) could impose costs or hamper growth.  
4. *Economic uncertainty:* Tariff policy, high interest rates and deflation concerns keep clients cautious ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrocks-fink-sees-trillions-dollars-idle-volatility-persists-2025-05-13/#:~:text=At%20the%20Saudi,deficits%20and%20volatility%20linked%20to)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrock-eyes-shorter-term-bets-amid-shaky-global-economic-foundations-2025-07-01/#:~:text=BlackRock%20Investment%20Institute%20,tariffs%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%E2%80%99s)). Elevated cash levels ($12T in Europe and $11T in US money funds idle ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrocks-fink-sees-trillions-dollars-idle-volatility-persists-2025-05-13/#:~:text=At%20the%20Saudi,deficits%20and%20volatility%20linked%20to))) indicate risk-averse clients, which could slow flows into BlackRock products if uncertainty endures.  

### Economic Moat  
BlackRock’s main moat derives from *intangible assets* (scale, brand, technology). Its massive AUM (now ~$12.5T ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=In%20Q2%202025%2C%20BlackRock%27s%20assets,organic))) and iShares brand give it cost and distribution advantages in fund markets. The Aladdin platform and data services create customer lock-in and a network effect in risk management. These assets offer some protection against competition. However, asset management has low entry barriers in core businesses and limited regulatory protection, so BlackRock’s moat is Narrow (intangible) rather than wide. The company’s leading market positions (43% share of EU ETFs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-bets-consumer-push-it-chases-european-savers-2025-03-20/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,funds%2C%20the%20company%20hopes%20to))) support fees, but the passive fund market remains price-sensitive.  

### Fair Value and Profit Drivers  
Our model assumes moderate revenue growth and steady margins. We estimate FY2024–2029 revenue CAGR of ~6%, driven by (1) base fee growth (~3–5% p.a.) from rising AUM and (2) modest performance fees. We project operating margins gradually expanding towards ~46% as high-tech and private-market revenues grow. We assume a weighted average cost of capital around 8.0% (beta ~1.0, 2% risk-free, 6% equity premium). Terminal growth is set at ~2%. Under these assumptions, our fair value estimate implies a mid-teens P/E multiple on 2026–27 EPS (reflecting roughly flat leverage and consistent buybacks). Key profit drivers are AUM levels (tied to markets), the mix shift to higher-fee alternatives/tech services, and cost control.  

### Risk & Uncertainty  
Macro and regulatory risks could swing valuation. Major risks include:  
- **Market volatility:** A downturn could erode fee income. Tariff conflicts or inflation shocks (as warned by CEO Fink ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrocks-fink-sees-trillions-dollars-idle-volatility-persists-2025-05-13/#:~:text=At%20the%20Saudi,deficits%20and%20volatility%20linked%20to))) might trigger AUM outflows. Conversely, an unexpected global rally could boost AUM and hide medium-term issues.  
- **Interest rates / yields:** Prolonged high rates could sustain fixed-income outflows (as seen in Q2 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/blackrocks-second-quarter-profit-rises-market-momentum-2025-07-15/#:~:text=base%20fee%20growth%20for%20the,The%20firm%20benefitted))) and reduce bond fund inflows, impacting revenue.  
- **Regulatory changes:** New regulations (SEC proxy disclosure rules ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-pauses-corporate-meetings-wake-new-esg-rules-2025-02-18/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,to%20pause%20meetings%20was%20reported)), anti-ESG pressure) might constrain BlackRock’s investing/engagement practices and impose compliance costs.  
- **Political/ESG scrutiny:** Accusations of politicization and legal challenges (e.g. Tennessee settlement on proxy transparency ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tennessee-attorney-general-settles-esg-dispute-with-blackrock-2025-01-17/#:~:text=Tennessee%20Attorney%20General%20Jonathan%20Skrmetti,BlackRock%27s%20CEO%20Larry%20Fink%20had))) could damage reputation or require strategic shifts.  
- **Competition:** Further fee compression from competitors could limit future growth, raising uncertainty around long-term revenue multiples.  

### Capital Allocation  
BlackRock generates strong cash flows and generally deploys capital wisely. It has a high equity base (150M shares) and returns excess cash via dividends and buybacks; we consider its allocation *exemplary*. The firm pursued disciplined M&A in high-return businesses (spending ~$25–30B on acquisitions like GIP, HPS, Preqin ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-assets-hit-record-116-trillion-fourth-quarter-2024-2025-01-15/#:~:text=%28ETFs%29,in)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/blackrock-coo-looking-improve-tech-ai-capabilities-2024-12-10/#:~:text=and%20managing%20data,data%20provider%2C%20by%20the%20end))) that bolster fee growth. Its targeted digital and data investments (e.g. tech hub hires ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-plans-hire-1200-people-india-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-02-05/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest%20asset,of%20data%20provider%20Preqin%2C%20BlackRock))) aim to improve efficiency. Recent history shows a balance of large strategic deals and capital returns. Our rating assumes continuation of shareholder-friendly policy and prudent deals, with no excessive debt.

### ESG Risk  
BlackRock’s ESG risk profile has been marked by recent controversies. The firm has drawn criticism from multiple angles: in 2024 it backed only 4.1% of environmental/social resolutions (down from 6.7% in 2023) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-trims-support-some-esg-resolutions-agm-season-2024-08-21/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20asset,BlackRock%20cited%20reasons%20such%20as)), attracting lawsuits and political pushback. In the U.S., regulators and state officials have challenged its proxy voting and ESG policies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tennessee-attorney-general-settles-esg-dispute-with-blackrock-2025-01-17/#:~:text=Tennessee%20Attorney%20General%20Jonathan%20Skrmetti,BlackRock%27s%20CEO%20Larry%20Fink%20had)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-pauses-corporate-meetings-wake-new-esg-rules-2025-02-18/#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20a%20major%20U,to%20pause%20meetings%20was%20reported)). These issues have heightened its ESG risk relative to peers. Material issues include corporate governance (voter transparency and alignment with clients), climate investment policy, and regulatory compliance. We estimate an *elevated* ESG risk, given BlackRock’s central role in responsible investing and the scrutiny it faces, though it reports adherence to global standards.
